- Potential data leakage risks detected. Please fix as suggested.

Leakage reviewer findings:
1. rule_id=class_weights_on_full_data
   - snippet: class_weights = compute_class_weights(merged_df[CFG.target_col].values.astype(int), num_labels=CFG.num_labels)
   - rationale: Class weights computed using entire merged dataset including validation data leaks target distribution information. Validation data should not influence training parameters like class weights.
   - suggestion: Compute class weights only on training split (tr_df) after train/val split.
Please regenerate the script addressing the above guardrail issues. Write logs to task/learning-agency-lab-automated-essay-scoring-2/outputs/7/code_7_v2.txt and produce submission_2.csv.
