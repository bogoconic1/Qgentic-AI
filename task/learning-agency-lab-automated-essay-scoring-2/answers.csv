d550b2d,"The face was not created by aliens because there is still no proof that aliens or any living thing that lives on mars NASA are still looking for life on mars so how can the face be made by mars. It was formed by shadows giving the illusion of a human head, eyes, nose and mouth. There was no alien monument after all. The face was just made up with clouds and dust particles from Mars. What the picture actaully show is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common aroung the American West.

The picture saying that the aliens created the face is just clouds forming a face on a stormy day on Mars beacuse our eyes can be illusion of what we see. The face was made up of dust and clouds which formed a face. tThe picture that was taken in 1976 looks like a face but doesnt have all thee features as the picture that was taken in 1998. The pictue that was taken in 1998 looks very simlar like a face u can see eyes, mouth, a nose. The picture that was taken in 2001 doesnt look like a face anymore looks like dryed up dirt.

The first picture starts to look like a face but isnt all done yet. The second picture u can see that it clearly has face features. The thrd picture looks like during the tme of the 1998 picture and 2001 picture (last one) that it doesnt look like a face no more it doesnt have the features of a face that we saw back in 1998.",2

I would recomend this job for anyone who likes to adventure. This job is full of fun and exploration. It takes a lot of wateing because ""it takes about two weeks to cross the Alantic ocean from the eastern coast of the United states and a month to get to china"".(paragraph 6).Theres also a lot of running around and getting the animals fed. When your waiting for the animals to fed you can have a lot of fun like playing table-tenis,vollyball,boxing which will pass the time. This program done be dangerous at times because there might be a storm or a hauracane. I acually broke my ribs trying to get across the Alantic. though it does pay out in the end.

I would totally recomend this program to anyone. We talked how it was good. It can be dangerous. Though you get to go to places you never thought you would go. In the end your doing this for a good cause.",2
ef04816,"The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because it is a waste of time. I think it's a waste of time because studies show that you can be able to tell when someone is down. Not by the face but by their actions. You will start to see a change in them, they wont act the same even if they try so hard to,ect. The Facial Action Coding System is a waste of money, time, and space.

Why do all this just to see if someone is hiding their emotions, when you can just observe them. A true friend, mother, father ect; will know if something is wrong with their loved ones. In the article the very first sentence says "" she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted , 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Why does it matter how fearful,disgusted,or angry she is if it clearly states she happy 83 percent. We are not computers, robots or none of that we are human beings and we all have different emotions running at the same time. Thats what makes us, us!

In the article it also states "" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect."" My point here is that you dont observe a persons feelings by looking at their face. You observe the way they act and compare it to how they usually act when mad, sad, or happy, ect. People sometimes hide their emotions by putting on a fake smile, hiding their true emotions thats why you observe actions.

I just feel as if its easy to tell the difference between different emotions. It's common sense to me, but it may not be to you. When you really think about it, they make it seem like its really complicated. But if you would just pay close attention to your loved ones, and stop thinking that everyone has to always be happy. Then you will see that its easy to tell the difference of each emotion we humans have.

This is why i think the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. Hopefully you will understand where i'm coming from. The Facial Action Coding System is unnessacary, and a waste of time. It's easy to tell when someone is acting strange or different. All you have to do is observe.   ",3
88ab8d9,"Do you ever wonder how many soomething is or how much something weights? In this essay the author compares more than one thing to one another.

The author supports the idea of ""The Challenging of Exploring Venus"" by comparing ""Earth as Venus twin and that it is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closet in distance too"" which means that Earth is the closet planet to Venus than any other planet in the world. Another way the author supports his text is by saying that ""Earth,Venus,and Mars,our other planety neighbor,orbit the sun at different speeds"" what that means is that all those other planets are the ones neighboring to it and that they have many different speeds and are many different sizes throughout the whole planet while it orbits. The third way the author supports his information in the text is by how he compares all the other planets to one another not just one planet to the next. Last supporting text the author supports in this is that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"" what the author is trying to say is that one big thickness of the atmosphere is almost basically covered 97 percent with a carbon dioxide blanket. In conclusion the author compares all these planets to one another.

In the second paragrah the author loves to use many different techniques to describe the story to people who are reading it. Another thing the author does in the story is tell how much Earth,Venus,Mars weigh throughout the whole story. Another way the author supports his evidence in the story is by telling us were they are located at.

In conclusion,the author supports his text very well by comparing the other planets to each other not just to one another. Also the author likes to use numbers to show how much of the percent got covered or how many times something happened during the times throughout the whole thing something got done in or covered.",2
cee8c0f,"This story is about discovering mars. Witch is pretty exicting because this is a big planet and every planet we discove is a new chance to find other life than the earth because if we have more knoledge about what outer space than we can go to the planets and maybe use the for our selfes or if their are any plant we can use / grow them here on earth.

So about 25 years ago NASA'S Viking one space ship was circleing the planet taking photos for a posible landing ship viking 2 when it spotted the shadowy likness of a human face.

An strange head nearly 2 miles away. The face on Mars have scine become a popular icon. It has been talked about everywhere.

It was a bid hit on NASA's Alot of people wanted to see the Face On Mars. The Face On Mars has starred in a hollywood film along with magazines and other products that could cause talk about The Face On Mars. Scientist bealived that the faces wher Alien artifact.

This story was about how the Face on mars was regonized all over the world and scientists are still trying to figure out what this face was, was it an artifact or was it just a strange dent/ crator in the mars land. But even till this day the world may never figure out what this strage face was or where it may have came from .",1
e3077bb,"In 1976, a mesa was discovered on Mars that resembled a face, calling it the ""Face

on Mars,"" or just the ""Face."" The face was located in a region on Mars called Cydonia. The Face is just a mesa on Mars. A few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, and some conspiracy theorists believe the Face was evidence of life on Mars that NASA would rather hide. The article says, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Sruveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking Photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This quate proves with the image that the Face on Mars isn't a face, it's a natural landform. The text also says, ""Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look."" ""'As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,' he added. 'So if there were any objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!'"" These quotes are telling how good the picture is so if there were any alien structures, we would be able to see them. The article also states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" What this quote is saying is the face was confirmed to be a Martian mesa, not an alien artifact or proof of life on Mars.",3
ae02008,"Dear State Senator,

I understand there has been some contreversy between keeping or changing the Electoral College by popular vote for the president of the United States, But We need to Keep the Electoral College, and these are the reasons why.

First things first, the Electoral College is a process,not a place. Also it consists of 538 electors but a majority of electoral votes needs to be 270 votes in order to elect a president. So each Canident has a 50/50 chance of winning or losing. The elctors are chosen by the political parties, which i can see how people would have a problem with that,but if they dodnt choose the canadents for us we probably would even know which person to elect as a canadent.

The presidental election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, giving the citizens more than enough time to decide if they are happy with the president they have or if they should elect a new one, usually there happy with the president they elected which means that the Electoral College process is working.

Although the electorla college system is for the voters to vote for a slate of electors to elect the president the citizens still get a say in the election towards there president of choice. if the citizens could just elect a president from there personal votes then they would probably make the wrong decsion on who to choose, they might be fooled by the flashy ads on tv promising change when in reality, there promises are lies. Thats why having a slate of electors help to vote for a president if so important because they know how to point out there lies and know what there true intentions are.

Some say that the Electoral College system is 'Unfair' to the people but i strongly disagree. Infact, the Electoral College helper the people choose the right president for our country    ",3
f2a704c,"The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a well written article about the knowledge we have about Venus. Scientists have been fascinated with the planet's characteristics, such as its weather patterns, orbital route, as well as Venus's geology. Even though we have quite a bit of information about the planet, there are still many things that we do not know about Venus. The author heavily advocates the need of exploring Venus for multiple reasons.

The article mentioned how scientists refer to Venus as Earth's twin. Venus shares a very similar size, density, and distance with our planet. The main issue with Venus is that the weather can be chaotic and unpredictable, as well as the planet's atmosphere and living conditions. However, while those factors may not be ideal, they could still be survivable for humans if we had the propper equipment

Another reason the article states is that Venus could have been the most similar planet to Earth. Scientists believe that Venus might have had large oceans similar to Earth's modern day oceans. This information alone is one of the reasons why scientists want to explore the planet more. We may be able to understand more about Earth's oceans through the possible oceans that used to exist on Venus.

One of the last reasons the author listed was that Venus is one of the closest destinations for us to visit. It will most likely be a long time before any human travels outside of the solar system, but a planet such as Venus would make the most sense to travel to. While it does sound phenomonal to attempt to land on Venus, it would be extremely dangerous to do so. There is nothing easy about traveling in space, and Venus's climate is too unpredictable to even reach its surface.

The article has many pieces of evidence that support the idea of studying Venus. Some of those ideas are currently very dangerous and improbable to even attempt, but they are still very good goals to strive for. The article sheds light on the importance of exploration, as well as the idea that there is an endless amount of knowledge beyond our understanding. Even if we fail, it is through our attempts that we continue to learn.   ",4
ba4349f,"Attention fellow citizens! Like most things, cars have it's advantages and disadvanteges. Cars have developed more problems from the usage on a regular basis. Limiting car use in cities can reduce the issues related to vehice usage to a minimum.

To begin, many cities have already set limitations on automobile usage such as Vauban, Germany and the outskirts of Freiburg near the Swiss and French boarders. Freiburg has actually banned cars except for the main thouroughfare and a few streets on the edge of the community.

70 percent of people in Vauban do not have a vehicle and 57 percent sold their car to move to Vauban. As we all know cars take a toll an the atmosphere itself by adding greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. 50 percent of greenhouse gasses in the United states are emited through cars, but on the other hand cars are responsible for only 12 percent. It seems to be that the car-less cities tend to be declining the negative effects in the atmosphere.

Next, Paris took the no-car rule to another level by banning all cars, depending on the day, to reduce conditions in the air quality because of the emitiones from the vehicles. A thick smof loomed over the city because of the gases produced form the automobiles. Drivers with licence plates with even numbers would not use their cars for the day and odd cars would be off the next in an attempt to redice the smog. After numerous days of reduced cars the smog began clear from it's usual state.

Also, another city that's cutting down car usage is Bogota Colombia. Bogota has created a ""car-free"" day to reduce the harmful gases created by cars and to encourage alternative forms of transportation. Anyone driving a vehicle would be fined $25. The turnout was big with many people participating showing reat results on the atmospheric conditions above the city. Another great thing that came out of this is the enthusiasm it brought to other countries who wanted some thing like this to encourage other formes of transportation and reduce pollution.

As seen in the article, limiting the time we use cars has a great impact on the environment and people around you. So what do you say? Put down the keys and ride a bike today!    ",3
0509d92,"In addition to, the story people think that the Face was created by aliens. In this essay i will be talking about, Whether or not people have proof or evidence that the Face was created by aliens?, What would make people think that the Face was created by aliens?, and How do you think this if you just found out about the Face?.

With that being said, Do you think these people that thought the Face was created by aliens have proof or any type of evidence?... I don't think they had proof or any type of evidence because it was on Mars people csn not go around assuming that it was created by aliens if they have no proof. People would have to go to Mars and see for theirselves. Just because it was founded on Mars doesn't neccesarly means that it was created by aliens.

Next, What makes people think that the Face was created by aliens?. Is it because they knew that it came from Mars?... I strongly believe it is because all these people knew that it came from Mars, i'll tell you why i think this. I think this because it appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery stores as stated in paragraph 5. So, because it appeared in so many places people started to make assumtions, and really believed that the Face was created and made by aliens.

Futhermore, How does people think this if they just recently found out about the Face?. Well, people think this just because it it was the most popular story or myth going on at the time and since it came from Mars that it was created by aliens because they know people doesn't live on Mars.. But, that doesn't mean human beings do not visit to see what it is like in person.

In my opinion, last but not least, people should not make any assumtions before they don't know the full story or the truth behind it all and to ask people who was it created it by and stop always thinking they know everything and making a lot of assuming statements, to where it makes a huge rumor around the world.",4
b0f9c2f,"My name is Luke Bomberger and I am going to tell you some cool things you get to do and see if you become a Seagoing Cowboy. First you will get to see animals that live in the sea such as dolphins, whales, and maybe a shark. One things that really gets me excited about being a Seagoing Cowboy is when I get to hang out on a boat with animals like horses and cows. I think that you should join because you could see the Statue of Liberty, and you might get to meet some really interesting people. When you have droped off the animals you might get to stay a little while and explore the town or city.

If you join the program you would be helping others when they need it. You could marvel at the Panama Canal on your way somewhere just like I did. On your way back you could play games and have tournaments in games such as softball, baseball, and table tennis where the animals were stored.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy you could be more aware of others and their needs. It made me grateful that I gave becoming a Seagoing Cowboy a chance and it changed my life.",2
69a1180,"The world is growing and growing as we know it. We are making more cars that could act as phones. But now, someone was actullay brave enough to come up witht he idea of driverless cars. I think the driverles cars are a great idea, more effiecent, and more reliable. Let me explain some of the reasons why.

The reason I think it is a very good idea is because the model would be more safer than the average car today. Today's cars you have to worry about gas, and if you don't have one of those fancy cars you won't know where to go. Unless you have really good phone serve. If we went with the driverless cars it would be more effiecent.

The reason I say that the driverless cars would be more effiecent is because the rate of cars crashes would go down at least 25 percent. You gotta think about it. If the car is already to go all you have to do is tell the car where you want to go and wah-lah, your good to go. If we were to make them the proper way, we wouldn't ven have to worry about drinking and driving or texting and driving. The rate of accidents like those would go down at least 25 percent if not 15 percent. That's when the reliable part comes in.

The reason why I say that the driverless car would be more reliable is because of drunk drivers and careless texters. This way we wouldn't have to worry about them. I mean it's still bad to drink and drive or text and drive but, still it'll keep them off the streets unless the car requires you to drive by hand then we really have a problem

In conclusion, If we make these cars the world would be a better place. We wouldn't have to worry about polution and stuff like that because the car wouldn't have to rely on gas. Also, it would keep the text and drunk drivers off the streets.",3
07f8601,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens it was a natural land form. There a many reasons that make it seem like the land form could have been made by aliens, but on the other hand there was no signs of any living thing that could have done this. there are many thing with this object that could lead you to beliveing either it was made by aliens.

In 1976 the Vikking took the picture that was bellived to look like a face. In 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over mars snapping pictuers that were ten times sharper than the first picture of then the first picture taken. By increaseing the sharpness of the picture it showed that it was a land form. The time of year that the first picture was taken it was a cloudy over the Red Planet. This could have made shadow that made the form look like it had eyes and nosie.

The last time the picture was taken (2001) the picture was taken in maximum resolution. This maximum photo if taken of earth you could see the pirimds in Egypt. So if there was anything weird the picture would have shown it.

In conclusion the picture taken in 2001 '' actually shows is the Martin eqivalent of a butte or mesa----landforms common around the American West.''(paragraph 12). All signs are now pointing to the fact that it was a natural landform. In the end NASA found out what it really was and that alines making this figure was false.",3

bd60d89,"The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irration. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The electoral college is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state. Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders.

The electoral college also has some good reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president. In the 2012's election, obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes. Obama won cause of the electoral college. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a lanslide electoral-vote victory in that state. So one good reason is the certainty of outcome.

Also another awesome reason is that the electoral college requires a presidental candidate to have transregional appel. No regions has enogh electoral votes to elect a president, so the south cant elect a president that will do something in favor with the south only. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. it avoids run-off elections.

My final answer is that i argue in favor of the electoral college. It would be hard to let every single citizem chose, because some people dont think about others and what it is good for all, people only think about themselfs and what it is good for themself. Plus the even thogh the president will win no matter if he/she won the popular vote. The electoral votes think for the state and what is good for the people.                    ",2
395a189,"I think Facial Action cording system should not be able to identify human emotions. As in pargraph 1 it says, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent,and 2 percent angry"". What if those percentages are wrong. Those percentages could not be real just by looking at the image she could of been happy. Those emotions are just identified by a computer, not all technology could be right. The computers/technology just identify but could be wrong by looking at the face of the image/picture they have used to dectect the emotion.

As in pargraph 3 it says, ""The process begins when the computer constucts a 3-D computer model of the face"". Ther computer cops the face of the image and copys and make it 3-D. The expression is compared against a neutral face. The motion that is shown is showing no emotion at all which. The computer that they use shows wether the face is happy or sad.

The computers use calculation to show wether the face of the image is happy or sad. There is certain muscles in every face that make the bonestructor make it what you look like. There are six emotions that are used every day sad,mad,happy,scared,disgust,and susprised. I think computers/technology should not be able to dectect the emotion just by what the picture/image looks like. There muscles that move in your body every day that is called an ""Action unit"" as it says in pargraph 3.      ",2
10fda69,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" D'Alto describes a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. One of the creator of this software Dr. Huang said his new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code ( paragraph 5). Going on, it knows your feelings by the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bone) that lifts the corners of your mouth. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because this new modern software can tell you how your peers are feeling.

Furthermore, imagine being able to detect exactly how your friends are feeling even when they are trying to hide their emotion. Pretty awesome! For example, "" They even indicate the difference between a geniune smile and a forced one"" (paragraph 7). This shows that the software can even tell the difference between a fake and a real one. So, that means if your friends are feeling down you can just notice by trying that new software. Another example, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in a painted face.""( paragraph 4). This example shows that a software can identify mixed emotions. Also, we humans perform this same calculation everyday, but in a different way. Thus, faces don't lie: those mucles ( zygomatic major and risorius) clues are sometimes used to stop when a smile is fake or real. Therefore, this software can help you know what your peers are feeling and each facial traits that conveys happy.

Going on, this software is very modern. For example, ""All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"" ( paragraph 3). This shows that the creators are trying to make the software scan a person's facial as close as possible. Another example, "" happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness""( paragraph 3). This shows that the software can alnost detect every feelings. Which is a great news. Thus, if you tighten your lips it shows anger and that's how the computer knows your angry. Pretty smart!

In conclusion, using this technology to read the emtional expreessions of students in a classroom is valuable. It can perform precisely specific emotions of your peers by simply scanning their faces. Thus, mention in paragraph 6, it can also pick what ads or video games to show by judging your face to make sure you are happy. Going on, the computer understands all this from your facial muscle movements. Therefore, the new software is a valuable thing to use on students to

express their feelings.",3

With the driveless car there could be less accidents,because of the sensors and flashing lights in the car,but overall the driveless car still isn't a good idea because there will have to be some sort of binary code on the road for the car to read,with that it would be way to expensive to pratically work .

In conclusion the driveless cars' wouldn't be a good idea,because people wouldn't really drive anymore,they're just partially driving and that wouldn't be fair to anyone who loves driving, if in the future they made every car ""driveless"".

In the future,how would having driveless cars' help our economy out ? How do they plan on saving fuel?What if the car just shuts down,who fault would it be?

7913c3a,"My position on driverless cars is very nutral. Like the passage stated there are a lot pros and cons when it comes to this topic, such as numerous types of road blocks like accidents and construction. When it comes to the diverless car getting to an accident people are confused on who it should be to blame the manufacturer, or the passenger. I personaly believe the passenger should be to blame, it doesn't matter how advanced the technology is something is bound to go wrong so you should always be on alert.

When it comes to some of the pros there are some strong ones. Driving will be a lot safer once a majority of people own a self driving car. There will be almost no accidents do to texting, falling asleep at the wheel, and drunk driving. Once we get to the point of almost everyone owning a self diving car they will most likely be eco-friendly. ",2

His reasons for exploring Venus is the closest planet to earth and is earth like and its a challenge that we should take no matter the risk. I dont think that he explained good enough on why its worth it.

The author of the artical, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" tells us that ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" This means that because its close and Earths ""twin"" its its worh exploring no matter the challenge it brings.

The author also says ""Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" When he says this he thinks that we should explore Venus no matter the dangers but in the artical he listed the dangers. He says Venus has a ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet."" If it's 90 times grater than what we experience on earth is it worth studying? He tells us that they sent nemerous spaccrafts to Venus but nun of them survieved longer than a few ours. If your spaceships cant land there and survive why send a human there risking lives?

In conclusion he told us some good facts about Venus like how its called Eaths twin, can be closest to earth sometimes, almost same size and same density,and that its 800 degrees Fahrenheit but i dont think his reasons explained good enough on why we should risk exploring there but he did have some good ideals on what they can do to explore Venus like hover over it 30 plus miles studying it.

c6eb28d,"Driverless cars are a very intriguing and thought provoking concept that manufacturers and society have toyed with for decades. The possibility of reducing the risk of human error is very tempting and a reason for why many people are in supports of having driverless cars. Although, not everyone shares the same opinion regarding cars that don't require human control. I do not think that completely driverless cars are the best way to go because of the high risk of a computer error, but minimal human interaction could possibly be very beneficial.

Many companies such as BMW and Google have been working on developing driverless cars. While these cars have had some success on the road, there are some situations where a human driver is needed to take control of the situation. One example of this is a construction zone. Cars can have a radar and know how the road twists and turns, but in construction zones that is all thrown out the window. There are usually new boundaries created by traffic cones that the sensors on the car might not be able to connect.

Even though I am opposed to cars that are completely driverless, I do think that the integration of this technology can be highly beneficial in some areas of driving. One place that I feel like computer-assisted driving can help is when a person is backing up. Often times it is hard to see everything and it can be very easy to hit something or someone while reversing in a car. A computer that generates three dimensional images of the car's surroundings, such as the LIDAR system used by Google, could assist drivers by helping them see things that they previously weren't able to see. I also think that an automatic brake that is activated when the car is dangerously close to an object would be beneficial as well.

While there are risks and rewards to a driverless car, I feel like the risk of a computer error is a great one that could cost money and lives. Driver assistance, including cameras for backing up and an automatic brake to help prevent wrecks, is something that I would be open to in the future. We could soon be seeing these driverless cars on the road as many companies plan to have models out in the next five or six years, but I doubt they will be completely driverless.        ",4
b51f7d0,"We should not use this technology in the classroom ,it is not a valuable.Human expression is just not determined through the face. Also, this takes the jobs of teachers and lessens the teacher-student relationship.In addition, not all students react the same, when not being able to comprehehnd a problem. The technology of a computer determining emotions I find fault in.

Humans express their feelings through many ways, but here at

Merrillville Highschool I often see girls laughing and smiling,but their leg is shaking, which means somethig is wrong. In paragraph 3, it says, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness."" How can you based that on Mona Lisa, when you cant prove that she was like that. This ineffective computer program use muscles in your face to determine someone's feelings , when ofter cases people can be nonchalant about something and really the feel something else.

Yet alone, this also takes another teacher's job, which ruins alot of lives. Teacher's are essential to the classroom and when a student don't understand a problem they don't expect a computer to understand.There's more to a student , maybe its not the problem they don't understand. They may be thinking of something else they don't understand and the computer notice that and change something they already was working on which confuses them even more.The teachers would notice that because they are human and they would know and seen that student recent behavior changes.

Students have different reactions to various situations. Students have different aspects and different way of seeing things. When some students they sit there and show they dont get it.On the other hand, students may act out in order to get some attention or just wont try at all. Study of human emotions can't be just determined through face muscle.

The Face Coding program I found an abundant amount of flaws in, it will not be valued in the classrooms.Humans are complex creatures and express emotions other than just through their face.Futhermore , this threatens human teacher's position at work.A human's emotions can't just be decided or determined through facial expressions there's more to it than that.",4
6af86c9,"Technology is the future, and with the advancement of technology comes the addition of responsibility for the people using it. One hundred and fifty years ago, we had a thriving textile industry, and the long awaited introduction of railroads and canals. Today, we are advancing with the hopes of creating a cost efficient self-driving vehicle that people from all reaches of the world can use. While this task may prove to be difficult, it is definitely a task that we should take on. Self-driving cars are a beneficial gateway to mastering concepts like artificial intelligence. Continuous experimentation with self-driving, or driverless cars will only prove to be benefical to humanity. I believe that the development of driverless cars will make driving safer, create opportunities in transportation, and lead on to greater advancments in technology.

Think of a world where technology is what gets people from one location to another. One would get in their vehicle, speak or type in a few commands, and be on the way to their desired location. If scientists can master driverless cars, the road would be a much safer place. Driverless cars would make many less mistakes than the average human being. With the use of the advanced sensors, GPS, and radars that have been developed, cars will be able to communicate with one another and make decisions faster than any human. Every vehicle will be on a network communicating with one another, allowing for the safest and most efficient driving. The mental and physical aspects of humans play a huge role in driving conditions. A human's driving capabilities are hindered by mental and physical feelings like anger or fatigue. These feelings do not have an effect on driverless cars. Driverless cars can only make the road a safer and more efficient place, as they are able to communicate with one another and eliminate common human mistakes.

Driverless cars are a stepping stone for greater transportation. With the developments of these technologies, improvements will be made in all aspects of transportation. Bus travel will become safer and more efficient. When this technology hits the world of aviation, planes and other aircraft will go beyond what they are today. Flying already uses extremely advanced technologies, but scientists can definitely push it to be better. When a well-made driverless car is developed, doors are opened for all types of transportation. Driverless cars will not only revolutionize all aspects of transportation, but it will also open doors in other areas of technology.

With the advancement of driverless cars, comes the eventual advancement of other technologies. The investment in the development of driverless cars will yield a great reward. Scientists will be able to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, which plays a huge role in driverless cars. Artificial intelligence pushes for a greater future, as it allows for robots and alike technologies to complete tasks that would be difficult or time consuming for humans. Radars and sensors will also improve. People see radar technology in the weather, and GPS systems. With the advancements of radar technology, there will be a day when scientists can detect a tornado hours before it is going to touch down. At that point in time, there may even be technology to stop natural disasters.

In conclusion, driverless cars will take time to perfect, but driverless cars will be worth it when this perfection comes. There is a plethera of advantages that driverless cars bring to the table. They make the driving world a safer, and more efficient place. The technologies used in driverless cars also open doors to new types of technology. The benefits heavily outweigh the consequences when it comes to the development of driverless cars. When the world wanted to reach the stars, we did, so now let us reach for a technology that will make the world a better place.           ",5
2c00451,"Did you know that there are plenty of advantages of limiting car u sage? Well your in luck im here to tell you that there are many good outcomes of not using a car.

You don't have to pay ""car fees"",because when do you have a car you have to park the car in a certain area and some of the places you decide to leave the car ask that you pay them to park in the space you had picked or selected.

Experts have notice that when you don't use your motor vehicle that it is a huge reduce of greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of the greehouse gas emissions in Europe, but 50% is from United States car-intensive.

People claim that they wanna try to make the ""World"" a better place, but some are not even tring to help. While some people on the suburn lifestyle actually have been trying because they've stop using there car and started riding biking or even walking rather. Back in the day around World War II we as people in society have depended on a car. So that needs to change soon or later, because what if one day you have to be somewhere important at a certain time and that car you depend on so much blows out? What are you going to to and you won't have enough time get your car done because it would probably take about 1-2 days in the shop. Think about it in your mind do you really need to depend on a car for transportation.

""DRIVING BAND IN PARIS?"" Yes Paris, France have band driving because they say that driving was polluting the air. So the people of Paris have reinforced a law that states you are not allowed to drive a motor vehicle. The only reason they had put the law because they want to clear the air of the global city since there was so much smog in the air. People of Paris were either the choice to leave their motor vehicle at home or suffer the chances of paying 22-euro fine. Since the smog had cleared up the law was rescind. See what cars do to our enviroment they mess up the climate it creates global warming which will soon kill us one day. It is much better/safe if we all in the world to aleast tried to not even bother usng a car if would all be great if we would use bikes cause they do not pollute the air we all breathe.

Well people ik get informed many different ways you or some one else reading this essayI wrote you have the power to change the way you see what cars do to us and the place we call Earth. I can try to inform you its bad and we should at least try not to use cars so much as we do today. I'm not saying you have to ut i dont think you or myself wanna die anytime soon because of global warming or any pollution our motor vehicles do well see ya! :)    ",3
4067a1e,"Personally I think that kind of technology is very valueable. The fact that we have that kind of tech is amazing and by advancing our schools with the rate

of technology we could make us a smarter country as a whole. For many teachers it can be very difficult to get a student to understand and like the material that is being taught to them. Even if they do, the emotions of a student can change and while some teachers can see a diffrence others can not. Brining this kind of technology into the classroom can help students start to want to come to the classroom and ingage in their education because the computer can recognise the kind of learning thechnique is need for each individual student. Instead of having only one teaching method that might only work for a small percent of the class.

This computer and its algorythms can identify if a student is getting bored or being unattentive ,so it can change its technque of teaching in the matter of seconds. For many people that can be extremly difficult to detect. More so if the student only changed its facial expression by just a bit. Although this could possibly be expensive it would be a good investment as a whole because in the long run the country or even around the world could benifit from smarter more attentive students.

In conclusion although it might seem like a bad idea we should imploment this kind of technology into the classrrom to further engage our students into good learning habits and a better more personal kind of education.",3

In 1976 are satilite the viking 1 was orbiting mars and takeing pictures of the planet. When we looked at them we noticed this one. A picture of a face on mars. When we noticed it eas just a mesa in the face. When some people herad about it they thoght it was aliens who made that. We then told them that it was just a mesa that when the shadows hit it it made it look like a face. And that nasa's budget wish there was an ancient civleization on mars. Ther is some like this one in the west. ONe is the middle butte in the snake river plain of Idaho. Some people say that nasa is hideing that there is life on mars and they say there is not.

So that is why we are telling people that it is a mesa. We don't want them to freak out that aliens excicst when they do not . We also wish there was an acient civilization on mars. In conclusion it s just a rock formation. That was there for a long time that shadows made us think it was a face. ",3

66663f1,"It is hard to imagine a world without cars being controlled without humans. Cars have been a mandatory factor in most of our everyday lives. If we as humans decide to cut out the human factor to driving, there are consequences. Consequences such as the threat of saftey, the lost jobs surrounded around vehicles, and the overall question; are self-driving cars nessecary?

Not very long ago, I like many before me, got my liscense at the age of sixteen. That day will forever linger in my mind everytime I put the keys in the ignition. As a young driver, my saftey is always a concern. I learned the true aspects of saftey in my drivers education course, and saftey has been stuck in my mind since. If we create a world where us as humans are no longer in control of saftey, are we not creating an unsafe world? I am expected to put my life in the hands of some machine, rather than putting life in my own hands.

Several years ago, the auto industry was a major factor for income for most people. The jobs surrounded by cars have always been imparative for humans. Then, machines took over the jobs humans had lived off of. Making the auto industry more efficient, but leaving many without jobs. Now we are faced with a similar situation, where the driverless cars take jobs from people who live off of driving.

The auto industry has been relatively the same over the past few years. Cars have become safer, faster, and all around more productive.

fc772da,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is an article focused on the topic of studying Venus and what diffculties can happen, but also the benefits and knowledge gained.

The author describes how exploring Venus can be dangerous but can also help the Earth's population.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents very well with evidence.

The author supports the main idea well with evidence and details included in the article.

At first, the author shows some of the dangers involved in exploring Venus, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"" (3).

This fact gives an example of a bad situation that people might go through if they explore Venus.

The author uses this fact to remain unbiased and show both sides of the argument.

Later in the article, the author says, ""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way... Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"" (5).

This statement describes a solution to humans not being able to survive Venus's conditions.

Exploring Venus is so important that scientests thought of ways to complete that mission safely.

Lastly, the author states, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth... Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (4).

This realization illustrates how beneficial traveling to Venus is because it could be a planet that humans could use for habitation.

Exploring Venus is necessary because the human population might need to use the planet in the future.

It is always good to have a backup plan if something on Earth goes horribly wrong.

Overall, facts listed in the text support the author's main idea and purpose.

The main idea, that Venus is worthy to pursuit even with its dangerous elements, is supported and shown well by the author.

The author does this by including facts and statements that keep the article unbiased and describe the incredible benefits of exploring Venus.

The main point comes across well because it opens the readers' mind to the possibility of venturing to Venus and what it could do for our planet.",3

Venus could have a lot we didn´t think it had, but no one, including myself, have ever study the planet at all. But we can now and see what lies in the planet known as Venus.

First off, Venus is one of the brightest points of light, making it simple for stargazers. Often called the Ëvening Star"" but the nickname can be misleadinng since the planet Venus is...well a planet. While also very simple to see from the distant safe advantage of Earth, it proves to be a very challenging place to examine more closer. It makes you wonder what´s even that planet to study about.

Next, Venus´ surface has their temperature average over 800 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our planet. The planet´s conditions Venus has is way more extreme than we thought it would be that we wouldn´t be accustomed to the second we even try to get there. Beyond the high pressure and the heat, Venusian geology and weather present some impediments like volcanoes that can erupt, earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to seek land onto its surface. No wonder why Venus is fascinatiing in some people´s eyes.

Lastly, going over to Venus with a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only have a limit insight on ground conditions since most of the forms can´t penetrate the dense atmosphere. It´s important to know that researchers cannot take samples of any rock, grass, or anything else in the distance. So if trying to seek to a conduct would have to resolve in getting close and personal despite any risks to do it. And that´s what makes Venus the planet that it is today.",1

Let's not forget about Colombia who has banned cars days after days and has force people to use buses and taxis. Most mayors or whoever is incharge of transportion feel like the country needs a little ajustments.

In German,Suburb life goes on without cars. Street parking , driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district. Vauban's streets are completely car free , but some car ownership is allowed , but there are only two places to park- large garages , car-owner can buy a space for $40,000 or at their home. some people enjoy they moment with having cars. To them it feels like less stress , and also is saving money. Vauban , home to 5,500 residents may be the most advanced experiment in low0car suburban life. For the past two decades they have been trying to make the city more denser , and better for walking. Though it's causing less stress on some people, the other half are missing their cars.

Paris bans driving due to smong. After days of near-record pollution , paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Some days even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine of $31. oo , and the next the day the odd- numbered plates do the same.  Almost 4,000 drivers were fined , according to an international news headqurtered in London. Diesel fuel was blamed , since France has a tax policy that favor diesel over gasoline. Finally the he smog cleared enough Monday.

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Colombia. It was seven  straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines. This was a good cause in Colombia. It was only to protect the people.

Vauban's streets in German are now being car frees unless you somewhere to park or a home with a driveway. Paris bans driving due to smog , for safty season.

""Of course,most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial traits that convey happy, worried, etc"" nick (5).this quote proves that we can not really tell what people intentions are by just looking at them, thats why we need this device in every school, airport, churche, court, and even home.

a6613a2,"In space it has been proven that there is no oxygen in any planet expect earth where we live. On May 24, 2001 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the plants when it took a picture oof a face that was planted on planet Mars known as the Red Planet. The picture looked like a shadowy likeness of a human face. The head in the picture was enormous. We figured that the face was nearly 2 miles from end to end. Some time later after studying and researching the picture, we leaked the picture to the public so they could give us there thoughts about it because NASA always likes to here from the people. As soon as the picture was public lots of people where saying that it looked like it was created by aliens. It was attracting lots of people. But a big percentage of those people said it looked like an aliens face which was a Huge rock formation but they kept defending their statement. But i want to make people believe NASA hat it was a Rock formation created by erosion and rock movement through out the years.

Most people have been saying that this face was created by aliens but i dont think so. The reason why i dont think this face was created by aliens is because just like on earth there is erosion,rocks,and plaitonic movement. On Mars there is that to, the only three things Mars dosen't have is oxygen, water, or any subtance of food or plants that make oxygen. The exprience at NASA over the years and the studying and researching every day and having to do expriments on the picture, have determine that those figures are caused by rock movement or metiorids that hit planet Mars. The thing is that no one really could of created that without any food or water.

I think after all the research NASA has done and the studying of the natural landform on Mars that was created by Rock Formation turns out to be ture and for evryone that thinks that me and my team at NASA are wrong well no i don't think i am wrong i think i am way beyond positive that we are right because NASA has done everything they can to bring the people the right information. The people that think the natural landform was created by alliens need to join NASA so they can come along see that NASA brings only the truth noting but the truth to the people. But NASA always trys to do there best to convince people to know the right information and to have the correct facts in hand. ",2
04d2b73,"Do you really need a computer to express your emotions? Updates in technology have found ways for a computer to track facial movements to detect human emotion. This allows computers to detect your emotions before you do. We are told to answer if this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I believe that this techonlogy is not valuable in a classroom.

My first reason for thinking its not valuable is because it doesn't provide any benefits to the classroom. Why does our expression or emotion need to be known by the teacher or computer? Education doesn't have to be amusing or easy. Thats the point of learning. Emotion isn't taken in to consideration when we are assigned homework.

Secondly, my reason for disagreeing with the valuability of this technology in a classroom is because looks are decieving. Let's say for example a stuent is doing perfectly well on their assessment and sees how much time has gone by. They are confused, but only for a second. This is sent to the instructor as a message of confusion on the topic. This has caused an unnessisary interuption on the assesment. Computers can't detect every emotion, and they surely can't detect where the cause of that emotion is coming from.

In contrast to my argument, one could say that for a computer, being able to tell emotions gives us an davantage. For example ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" as quoted in paragraph 6. I would argue that if a student is becoming confused then they should ask questions. Also, it is natural to not take interest in the lesson. Boredom is commom in school, but that should not impact the ability to learn.

In conclusion, the technology provides no real benefits to a classroom, neither to a student. Bringing this technology to a classroom would be a waste of time. Emotions are decieving in school and don't have to be acknowledged by a computer. This is why I believe the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.",4

Everyone seems to believe that the face on mars was created by Aliens. They say that the scientists are wrong by saying it was a natural landform. But, do they actually do research like the scientists do? There are many reasons that the face on mars is just a lanform, and here are those reasons.

First off, when NASA's Vicking one spacecraft was just circling and roaming around it came across something unexpecting. By snapping a few pictures, they believed it was a face. Later, when it was revealed to the world, people believed that aliens had made that mark on mars. The texts says, that no one has past over that ""face"" in awhile. So how come a few pictures identify a face by using one camera? So that's when scientist decided to investigate the face on mars.

After scientists did a little research on their own, ""The Face"" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west. How can that be? Well, i will expect no one to believe that because for 25 years it was known as the face on mars. Scientists had to travel up to space by Mars and snap several pictures of the face. After they did their research collected thir data it came out to be a landform.

Some say that the scientists used a digital three image camera. What's the difference its just a camera. Well, that camera captured the truth about mars. For proof, if you looked online you can actually see what was really there. Even NASA's spacecraft revealed it to be a messa. So, it was just a false staement. There was no alien monument, in the first place. So for 25 years the face on Mars was actually a messa. But NASA would rather hide the truth about what they saw. So until, it's revealed as an actual face, it will be known as a messa or some peopel still say it's the face of Mars.

So with that all said, the face turned out to be a messa. So with the actual data, everyone should know that it is a messa. So wa sthe face really created by aliens, no it was not. It was really a landform.            ",4
e02d0ae,"In my option I think we shouldn't have driveless cars becasuese a moufunction can happen in the vhelic and make the person crash, What if something happens to on of the sensors?

I can't imagine a time in the future when no one needs them anymore becasuse I'm sure no one wants to wait until one of the Taxis are free. I'm the type of person thart doesn't have the patients to wait until a taxi to come pick me up. What if you want to have a latenight drive and taxis drivers don't allow that? What if someone ges irrritated because the taxi driver has a very monotone voice? What if hacker hacks into someone driveless car and kidnaps them by driving their smart car to a whole new destination.

In the passage in paragraph 3 it says, ""These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" That means it would cost a lot of money to fix every single road just so a driveless car could go. And that means it has to be a debate on if everyone argrees with it. Im sure everyone does want to keep spending their money on a taxi and they have bills to pay. That's like annihilating all of the vehicles in that area.

In paragraph 5 it say "" In the 1980s, automakers used speed senors at the wheels in the creation of anitlock brakes."" So it took them 10 years just so they can make a more advance senors for thr speed. I'm sure its going to take longer for manufacters to make roads, just so driveless cars can ride on. It also say,"" Further improvements in sensors and computers hardware and software to make dricing safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more drving tasks on theur own."" The future cars are going to be incorrigible. They're going to have more control then humans would.

In conclusion, these are some reason why we shouldn't have driveless cars. Like why would someone want to abandon a brand new car they just bought or a very old car that could be worth a lot of money? Remember the future is not the answer.   ",3
0c6cb29,"Reckless drivers are dangers, they have no care for the world or people who are in it. One point of evidence is that in 2013, BMW announced the development of the '' Traffic Jam Assistant''. So this means that when you are driving up to 25 mph you have a smart car , but when you go over 25 mph you have just a normal car . See the point that I'm trying to make is that when people had a little bit to much to drink and they go over 25 mph they're like a missle that can blow up at any time. Some sensors on the car may fail while you are driving , lets say if your driving down the street in a BMW at 20 mph and a car passes you and your not looking and you happen to run into it, its the cars fault and the owner because the driver should've been looking and the car should've stop on the dime. Because BMW developed this new System and its mention in paragraph 7 '' The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph , but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Also mention by BMW ''They can steer, accelerate, and brake by themsevles. So if the driver in this situation was looking down at a phone lets say ,and runs into the back of someones car who's fault would it have been ? I would have blame the manfacturer company because they said that the car is supose to brake themselves if danger is near or coming up . So if the owner was hurt then it would've been on manufacturer company all because they said that this car had sensors that could alert the drivers. Also which leads to another point lets say that the sensors fail without the driver knowing and she was driving a little bit reckless then that would been her fault and the cars. So I think that people should stop driving so reckless and start paying attention to the road . Also I think that a new law should be passed saying that car companies should recall their cars every 5 to 6 years to upgrade the safety quality on their cars. This will safe a numerous amout of people's lives and increase the amount of cars being sold by BMW. ",2
ecaf156,"The Face on Mars is definitely not an alien artifact. It is just a natural landform that was formed on Mars. Don't you think we would have discovered this earlier if it was an alien artifact.

When we first photographed the Face is 1976 we said it looked like a face, but when we released the pictures a few days later the caption noted a ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This means that other people here at NASA had doubts about it being an actual human head.

When we went to photograph it a second time in 1998 we got a picture that was ten times sharper than the original photos. After waiting for the image to appear on the internet we stated that it was just a natural landform and that there was no alien monument after all.

Then we went back to photograph the Face a third time to prove that it was just a natural landform on April 8, 2001. It was a cloudless summer day which means that the images would be clear. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's best quality. Jim Garvin later added to the subject of the Face being a natural landform by saying ""It remimds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake Piver Plain in Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes form of an isloated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This means that Jim Garvin believes that it may just be a lava dome that is on Mars and not a face.

Now some people might say we don't want anybody knowing there is life on Mars. Conspiracy theorists say "" The Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide."" But why would we want to hide life on Mars. It wouldn't hurt our business if anything it would make our business even better so why would we want to keep it a secret if it really was a face.

There is just to much evidence as to why this lanform isn't a face. I'm sure many of people would agree with me on this topic. Maybe one day we will discover life on Mars, but for now it is just a natural landform.                          ",4
14d000b,"In the story, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author talks about what Venus is like and what NASA needs to do to get a machine on Venus so they can study it despite Venus's harsh conditions. Venus has a surface temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater then earth. That being said, the goal to get to Venus is still highly influenced because their are so many upsides. The author did a excellent job explaining how this trip is a worthy pursuit.

One upside to this trip if it works, is Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, occasionally the closest in distance too. A example the author used on why its a worthy pursuit is, ""Venus is the most earth-like planet n are solar system. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Eath."" The author is saying that we need to keep exploring no matter how hard it may be. Venus is the closest thing to eath that their is. Maybe one day people can live on this planet.

In conclusion, making a trip to Venus, whether flying above it or landing on it is going to be a major challenge. NASA is already making incredible strides in making a machine that can withold Venus's conditions. As of right now all NASA wants to do is land on Venus or fly above it and grab a few samples off of Venus and go test it. The author did a great job of explaining why it is so important to pursue going to Venus. The author gave many advantages of the trip and disadvantges of the trip.                    ",3
8029c4d,"Many people, and car companies, are beginning to come up with the idea of driverless cars. Driverless cars have always been an idea to people but never a reality, they have been featured in many things, such as movies and books, companies are now trying to make this idea an actual reality in our lifetime. There are many pros and cons to driverless cars, but we have to think will this be an advantage or disadvantage to our society?

My opinion on driverless cars is on both sides, I see many advantages and disadvantages, such as; driverless cars are said to cut the use of fuel by half which would be great for our planet, but also it could be very dangerous because we all know that if we have driverless cars we will have people who use the cars as excuses or reasons to do things that are not considered lawful today without driverless cars.

People who may be for the driverless cars may not be wanting the driverless cars for good reasons, they may think that because they are not in total control of the car at all times that gives them the excuse of they are not one hundred percent reasonsable for anything bad that may happen while they are in the car. They may think that they can get away with many more things because they are not driving the whole time, they could get away with texting and driving, or even being under the influence while driving. Yes, these cars will give them signals for when they need to drive but who knows if they will actually pay attention to the signal. If people today do not think anything of the laws we have set in our country what makes us think that just because they are not driving that it is any safer?

People who are for the car for good reasons are thinking about how much driverless cars could help our world. Driverless cars cut the amount of fuel used in half, that would help not only our economy but our ecosystem. These driverless cars are said to decrease the amount of wrecks happening everyday, they will have automatic brakes, these cars would basically be able to tell when we are in danger. All of the sensors on these cars could maybe even take sensors into homes and stores that could make our world so much safer.

If you were not able to tell I think I may be against the development of driverless cars, in my opinion I think there are many more things that could go wrong with the car than things that could go right. People may not take the idea of these cars seriously, but we need to realize that these cars may become an actual reality and there is nothing that we can do about it but accept it and become aware of the things that we should be doing rather than the things we could do with driverless cars.

cc41976,"The future of transportation

Have you ever wondered how cool a self-driving car would be? I'm pretty sure almost everyone has at one point. I believe we have the right technology to do so. But are they really reasonable and safe? Even though the government does not want them on the streets(for safety reasons), i support the development of them. In this essay I will discuss the safety, cost, and a taxis-sytem related with these futuristic cars.

Safety is the number one concern. What if you were driving down the road and you were suddenly rear-ended by a driverless car? You would be pretty mad wouldnt you? Well that most likely wouldnt happen, as developing technology has allowed us to do wonderful things. Now, these cars aren't just driving around unmanned. There is still a human in the vehicle to take over when such things as roadwork, detours, and accidents are present. Thanks to research and advancing tecnology's, we have 3-D modeling software to constantly update the vehicles surroundings. Before 2000, the sensors and computers simply weren't smart enough to complete this task.

The cost to actually purcahse one of these interesting cars would most likely result in bankruptcy. With all the technology and time put in to the car, this is reasonable. But why make futuristic cars if people can't buy them? After full-scale production of these vehicles have started, the cost will most likely decrease. Well i believe that in a few decades, the whole world will be filled with self-driving cars. Or even better, flying cars!

Have you ever lived far from town and you didn't have a form of transportation? Well what if we used these cars as a form of public transportation. You could call a hotline and give your location and the car would be there in minutes! This system would be more promising than a local bus. Buses have set pick up times and routes, while these cars could pick up individuals and take them to their destination with ease and comfort.

The future is here, Driverless cars. Even though the government does not want them on the streets, i support the development of them. We once attempted to produce these vehicles before the 2000's but we did not have the advances in technology. I feel as if the cost of these vehicles will decrease as mass production takes place. The safety of these machines are state of the art and ensure you will make it to your destination in one piece. With these new advances, the driverless car could take over the public transportation system to form a quick and easy taxi service. With all these advancing technology's and sciences, i would love to see what they come up with in the future... or is the future already here?",4
d44ee2e,"This new technology would be a good thing to use in a classroom because a teacher would be able to determine a students reaction to a comment made from another student. Lets say a student was getting bullied, the teacher then would be able to tell how the student is feeling after what he just got called/made fun of them and would be able to make the apropriate action against the other student. But this technology should be used only for certain times in a classroom. The technology would be able to prevent fights in schools before they even happen.

But if the students in the classroom don't want their emotions read by a computer/ new technology they should have the right to not have their emotions read without them knowing. Also this technology would help the suiside problem in this world. It would prevent kids that go to school that get bullied realise what they have instead of going home crying in their rooms, locking the doors from their parents and eventually killing themselves because some student at the same school is bullying the other student beccause he is too selfish and doesn't think before they say something.

Bullying is a big problem and this new technology would be very useful in schools and across the globe. But there is pro's/con's to new creations that people make everyday and people around the world will continue to exspose them everyday.",3
1efe2a5,"Is the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom valuable? I think it is valuable becuase in paragraph six line six it states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" In that case the lesson could be modified to be more intresting.

Computers that can read human emotions just from their faces can apeal to humans more. If you see something you like and smile it will show you more of that. Students could have a more emotional conection with computers. In paragraph six line ten it says ""Most human communtication is nonverbal, including emotional communtication...So computers need to understand that, too.""

To students it would almost be like having a teacher in the room instead of a computer. Having technology read emotional expressions is valuable because it would be able to read facial featchers better than a human. It would be able to know if you happy if you raise your lips at the corners of your mouth or squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corners of your eyes. The technology can even see more than more emotion like in the Mona Lisa. Paragraph one line one states ""Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.""

Overall I believe technology to read the emtionsl expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It can help students be more intrested in their lesson. ",3
716b5df,"The author evaluated their ideas about visiting Venus well in their essay, however, they did have some aspects that could be improved upon. Their introduction lacked a strong thesis which can have a negative impact on the rest of the essay if their claims aren't strongly proven. Despite their weak thesis, their claims made later in the essay were strongly proven. Not only did the author give basic background knowledge of venus and two main reasons as to why studying venus could benefit the human race, but they also gave a solution to the dangers that came with exploring the planets..

In the introduction paragraph, the author didn't give a strong thesis to state their clame. When making a thesis you want to include what claims you will be covering in the essay and what you are trying to prove. The only claim the author gave was in the last sentence of the paragraph where they stated,"" It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."" They didn't give specifics as to what claims they will make to prove that Venus should be examined and their vocabulary seemed limited when they used the word ""very.""

Throughout the second and third paragraphs of the essay, the writer gave background knowledge of Venus compared to Earth. This was a good decision because they later used some of the facts that were stated to strengthen their reasoning as to why Venus should be visited and examined. They stated how hard it was to examine Venus and how dangerous the planet was for life. The planet would not be able to sustain human life due to it's harsh terrain and harsh weather. One of the reasons scientists are studying Venus is because they believed that Venus looked like what modern-day Earth does at one point. The writer bringing up how unhabitable Venus is strengthens their argument on why we need to study Venus and their belief that because this happened to Venus, then it could potentially happen to Earth.

Writing about how Venus used to be like Earth and why that's important is a strong point to support the writers claim. When writing a persuasive or argumentative essay, including how what the author is writing about can benefit the reader is a way to persuade the reader to agree with the author. In the essay, the writer talks about two different ways that learning about Venus can benefit the human race. The first reason has to do with benefiting the way that humans are able to survive on Earth. Finding out what changed Venus to become inhabitable can stop the potential for the same to happen to Earth. The next reason they argued, in paragraph 4, was that if something happens to Earth, Venus is in close proximity. One day, the Earth's surface may become dangerous for human life and humans must flee to the nearest planet to survive. The author believes that finding out the exact conditions of Venus and finding a way to sustain human life on the planet would greatly benefit the human races future.

Lastly, the writer gives a solution to the most important problem stated in the essay, that it would be difficult for humans to live on Venus or even visit it. Throughout the fifth and sixth paragraph, the author talks about how research has already been done to find ways for humans to live on Earth. They even provide ideas of the their own for how humans can live on Venus. Pointing out problems with your ideas but then solving them is a strong way to argue your point because it eliminates the question of ""will it fail?"" and might answer some questions that readers have when reading the essay.

Overall, the author argues their points well. The structure of their essay has some aspects that can and should be changed, such as the introduction paragraph. The author showed why their claim was important to the reader and answered the ""how will it be done?"" part of their claim. Answering the ""how will it be done?"" part of the claim can eliminate doubt among the reader and strengthen the argument that the writer is trying to get across to the reader.            ",6
ba25169,"New technology is being made all around the world, that is changing society as we know it. One example of this technology is called Facial Action Coding System. Many people are wondering if the world should put something like this in schools so teachers can read students emotions. I think we should give this technology to teachers because this could help prevent casualties, and even the lack of school work students will do.

One reason I think the Facial Action Coding System should be in schools is because it could prevent casualties at home or at school such as school shootings and suicides. This technology could help prevent these casualties by letting the teacher know if a student is happy or upset. this meaning if a student is upset a teacher could get the student help or even help the student themselves by talking to them on why they are upset. For example students all around are getting bullied and not letting other people know how they feel or let them know they are getting bullied, so these students leave school being upset and they go home a commit suicide thinking they aren't important and thinking nobody wanted to help them. Therefore if teachers had this new technology I think teacher would be able to prevent this from happening by seeing how the student feels and therefore the teacher can talk to them and hear about what is happening. This will also make the students that do get upset feel like there are people out there that want to help them and that notice them.

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System should be in schools is because the lack of school work being done because students are upset. This technology could help teachers get students to do their work or to even study, by letting the teacher know if the student is having a bad day. I think this will help because if a student is having a bad day then they won't want to do work because they are upset and just most people don't want to do work when they're upset, so if teachers had this technology I think they could talk to the students and try and get them in a better mood for themto do their work. Another reason why teachers should ge this because if a student is upset and they want to do their work, their work isn't going to beas good as if they were happy, and all teachers like to see their students with the best work.

There is new technology being made all around the world, that is changing society as we know it such as the Facial Action Coding system. This is why i think this technology should be put into schools.                 ",4
25a9e8a,"In the Article "" Driverless Cars Are Coming"" has a very distinct view on cars. Majority rules that even though these computer cars are more efficient, it can also be endangered for the drivers due to any conditions. These smart cars need more power than just a start button they need sensors. For instance the Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, etc. These smart cars are just too much not just for one person but multiple. These cars may seem fascinating but once you get that bill you'll think other wise . The expenses on the material , technology , and anything else you want will break your pockets. So why even bother when you can have a normal SUV truck that you drive on the regular.

Others may vouch that "" Regurlar Cars "" are basic and dual. They need something that will keep them up to speed. Of course regular cars may cause you more gas, fix broken parts , and more focusing on the road than having the car that can do it itself. But do you really want to waste all your time putting money into a smart car. Thats only going to last for almost a year before you give up. These high technology sensors are nothing new , of course . In 1980, automakers used speed sensors. Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger surroundings.

Are these smart cars actually keeping citizens safe? In 2013, BMW announced the development of the ""Traffic Jam Asissitant"". The car can handle driving functions at speed up to 25 mph, But special touch sensors make sure the drivers keeps hold of the wheel. A regular 2009 lexis doesn't need the stability of an assisstant nor these high risk sensors. this car can obtain the same ability of a smart car. So, whats the difference high technology cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. Wow!! thats very exciting, even though notifying a driver about upcoming navigations such as work zones, accidents. Human drivers still must remain alert and be ready to take over when situations like that occur. Why investigate into something you cant actually control , but can also harm yourself and others.

These sensors can go out at anytime developing a more dramatic problem upon yourself. By having a regular car you can just go to the gorage an get it fix. Instead of waiting for days to get all the technology back up to running you'll be out on the road an no time. Considering that its more cheaper an less parts to fix. Human aspects on technology is very inconsiderate than rallying on themselves to get the job done. ",4
7ae56ec,"Driverless cars or drivers driving a car? Technology is good but too much can be fatal. Driverless cars will be inefficient, expensive, and make people lazy.

Driverless cars will become inefficient because after a few years they'll need repare and could get viruses in them. Driverless cars so far require of human skill so people still need to be aware. Therefore, probably causing many accidents on the road because of unefficiency from the car. Drivers would get bored to await their to turn to drive. So far there are no laws that approve driverless cars, because it requires a human to drive a car.

Not only will they be inefficient but will cost many companies a lot of money to develop. In the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on special track embedded with electrical cable; however, it required massive upgrades to exisiting road, something that was too expensive to be practical. Not only will it be expensive for companies but also for the state making roads for the driveless cars. A radar that would help with the transportation of driverless cars can cost up to two hundred million dollars.

If driverless cars ever came to be that would make people very lazy. People would be picked up whenever they need to go somewhere without causing them a little of activity but to walk to a car. Yes, it could be a benefit when you have an emergency and can't drive yourself around. Yet there are numbers and places you could call in case of an emergency. Humans will eventually rely on technology so much that soon they'll invent chairs that require no getting up from them to go to the kitchen. People need to be active and with driverless cars there'll be a lazy society.

Technology is becoming to powerful and needs to be limited. With driverless cars there will be a lot of economical expenses, many inefficencies, and laziness among the country.  ",4
329e332,"In the passage given, the author states that Venus would be a great place for studying, although it takes many risks to get more information based on it. The risks can be very deadly, but may give new information. There is so much more than NASA and even the world would like to know about Venus also known as the ""Evening Star"".

There is many ways as to why Venus would be great for studying. Venus is very simple to see from distant and is also known as Earth's twin. Venus is known as the earth's twin because it is closest to the planet in terms of density and size. There is much more information about Venus that needs to be found but may take risks. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system which can be very deadly if someone were to go look for evidence. For Venus being very hot, it can cause certain electronics to catch on fire due to the high temperatures. Not only the heat, but the atmospheric pressure is very high.

NASA is now finding ways to find further evidence on Venus and get evidence based on the information they have heard. They're finding ways to look at Venus in a closer distance such as using mechanical computers that were used in the 1940s. These mechanical computers made a huge impact during World War ll and they believe that this may help with discovering more on Venus.              ",2

Star""? It is the planet Venus from our solar system and is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Many factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a difficult planet for humans to study. However, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangerous it presents. He supports his idea very well because he use evidence to say why is it worthy to pursuit Venus and because he use a lot of facts about the planets, specially from Venus and Earth.

The author supports his idea very well because he use evidence to say why is it worthy to pursuit Venus. For example, he uses the Astronomers as evidence. As the article says (paragraph 4) ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system...Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"". He also use evidence to show how challenging its to get information about Venus. For example (paragraph 6), ""Many researches are working on innovation that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"".

Also, the author uses a lot of facts about the planets, specially from Venus and Earth. As the author says in the article (pararaph 4), ""Long ago,, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth... Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The planet has a surface of rcky sediment and includes familiar features such as valley, mountains, and craters"". The author use a lot of descriptive words and try to connect it to the Earth features.

In conclusion, the author his idea very well because he use evidence to say why is it worthy to pursuit Venus despite the dangerous, for example he use the Astronomers evidence, in which they say that they are fascinated by Venus because it may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system; and because the author also use facts about the planets, speacially about Venus and Earth, like he said that time ago Venus was covered largely with oceans.",4
573d36c,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, extreme actions on Venus. Venus, is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" this is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. The nickname is misleading since Venus is acually a planet. Venus is the second planet from the sun. Even thought Earth, Venus, and Mars, planetart neighbor, orbits the sun at different speeds, Venus is the most dangerous planet. Spacecrafts have been sent to land on Venus, but every mission has failed.

Another detail that explaines why Venus is a

pursuit despite the dangers because not a single spacecraft has landed on Venus, it hasn't touched the ground more then three decades. Venus' air is 97% carbon dioxide, the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we expericence on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such as environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy mant matels. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun.

Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could havr supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus has still some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and creatures.

Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. On our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.              ",2
0293f31,"The Facial Action Coding System is a great achivement in science and technology, but should it be used in your computer at school? There are many reasons why using this coding systam could be a great thing in the class room, or a disaster. As stated in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, if we could put this in our everyday school computers, it could calculate whether or not a student is having trouble with a lesson and change it for them to help them. What are the pros? What are the cons?

Some of the pros to using this coding system in students computers is as stated in the article, it could read the studens facial expresssions and determan if he or she is confused or having trouble understanding the lesson. If it could do this it could change the way the lesson it tought better helping the student understand.

But what if schools dont teach lessons online. For example, my school does not teach lessons online. Our teachers might give us website addresses to look up and use for studying, depending on the teacher. Unlike other schools around me that do E-learning. They either stay at home, or go to school and do a whole days work off of their school issued computers. This Facial Action Coding System would work greatly for those students that do E-Learning, but not so much for the ones that don't.

Secondly, does this system cost anything? If so how much? And do schools really need to spend extra money on a system to be installed in our computers? Schools have gotten along just fine without this for years. Schools did just fine before they were even using technology like computers in the first place. I don't think that we are really in need of something like this. Students using the internet to do assigments always ask questions if they have any. Those students also have internet acsess if they are working on online assignments, so they could also search for more websites to help them better understand.

Another topic listed in the article was using the coding systam to learn if that person was intrested in an add that showed up on their computer or not. I belive that adds are already annoying enough, I do not want a coding systam reading my face and giving me adds that I would be more intrested in. Doing so would distract that person from trying to get their work done. For example, if I was a student scrolling through a website I am using to fill out an assignment for school, I don't want a bunch of adds poping up distracting me from my work. Espesially when its and add that intrests me. If its something that intrestes me, then I'm more likely to click on it distracting me from my work. I sertanly wouldn't want that to happen, and I belive nobody else does either.

Really there are a lot of great points to both sides of the topic, but it is mainly up to the schools if they want to use The Facial Action Coding System or not. They only need to ask themselfs the right questions. Do our teachers teach offline alot? Do we have the money for technology like this? And do our students really want to use this or not?                ",3
4a2e401,"Have you ever actually wondered if aliens exist? i bet you have well,everyone has there own definition on a alien. But who really is to say they arent from here on out ill telll you why i think aliens created such a face.

first there were alien markings. from what i know about aliens there very smart. if aliens are smart why not blame it on them. and even in paragraph 8 i qoute it sais ""alien markings were hidden by a haze"" why wouldnt an alien make a face if they have nearly as much intelligence then yes. id have to say the aliens mine as well have done it.

second in the photo from 1998 the photo is very clear it is a face but in the photo from 2001 it is cracked and doesnt nearly look the same maybe a alien could have drew that or really anything not that i have evidence but im just saying if it looks like that. that looks like the creation of a non human. but who really knows.

but you also have to think this a is a nother planet so why wouldnt it be a aliens creation.

so through all ive said what i mean is through a humans creation we are very intelligent, and if aliens are anything like us id say they would have a great chance of creating that. this is another planet so i mean if they did and they lived thier then i mean thats were they live thats there house thier art. over the years the face got different if started to fade. maybe if it was aliens they were trying to tell us something.

but id also like to know your opinion.

aliens or just something there to intrest.            ",1
bf9407b,"""The Face of Mars"" true or not? ""The Face of Mars"" is no face at all. Even though with the low resoution, it looks like an Egyptian pharaoh, it just rocks and lava. There are so many reason why its not. Just read on and you will find out why I think this way.

""The Face of Mars"", all it is is a martian mesa. these are very common around cydonia. All that this one had was a weird shadowing effect. Our eyes can change to what we know son that is make sense, that why everyone saw a face we also put what we know to something we have no clue on if it help explain it.

The face is just a normal landform. This ""Face of Mars"" is just like landforms on earth. Some may just look like common things we see everyday. you can't just assume that since it look like someone made that it couldn't be is an natural made landform.

The picture of ""The Face of Mars"" everyone says looks like a face is such a low resoution it's only 43 meters per pixel. The more resent picture is 1.56 meters per pixel. With the 1.56 meters per pixel you can see more of what's on the surface compared to the 43 meters per pixel.

From the low resoultion to it just a normal landform. From the fact that it looks like other landforms when in a better picture to there's not enough information for it being a alien made object. Theres so many reasons why this not anything more. ",3

c4c72a0,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it might present. The author includes details that back-up his idea. For example, Venus resembles earth in many ways and so

exploring it might be beneficial for the future. Also, despite all the challenges that would obviously be faced at some point while trying to explore Venus, it is important to have knowledge about the outter space - in which human curiosity could play a huge part of. Finally, researchers can't seem to study Venus without having anything that could be used as a sample, since the conditions there are very much deadly for humans.

Firstly, the Earth has many conditions that humans need to survive, in which Venus seems to have a huge resemblance of. Scientistes found that Venus is the closest look-alike planet to Earth than any other planet in our solar system. The text reads, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth."" Thus, it could support and hold various forms of life in the future if explored and studied upon.

Secondly, although Venus has many factors that resemble the planet Earth no scientist can study it without having a sample from it to gain more knowledge about it. Unfortunatly, no human could survive more than a couple of hourse in its crucial conditions. Paragraph 3 reads, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine - and Liquefy many metals."" Nevertheless, Scientists and researchers are still looking for solutions to explore Venus safely - for it could be our nearest option for a planetory visit.

Finally, the author believes that even though challenges could be extreme and dangerouse, if the challenge presented by Venus is taken over it wouldn't only bring along important informations but will also benefit our curiose human minds and pushes us to discover and learn more about outter space. Paragraph 8 states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to bee gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Nonetheless, exploring and having the chance to gain more knowledge shouldn't be limited by dangers and difficulties, yet should be conquered along with our doubts.

In conclusion, the author includes and mentions many important factors and reasons on why we should take over the challenge of exploring Venus. In great details, he includes of how Venus despite for its extreme conditions could be explored and maybe even support some type of life.Therefore, letting our minds go above what we maximize for it is very important for that it coud lead to more and more discoveries and explorations that could add to our knowledge, in which will be very essential for our future.

c875917,This is my deatlis to back the witer on his claim how how studying venus is both worthy and dangerousand to explain how the author backs himself up on his claim. He gives alot of good points but a huge point that stood out to me was wehen he said how venus is sometimes called Earth's twin becuase in distance venus is the closest planet to us in denstity and size so pretty much Venus is a mini Earth. Another thing that the author toched on is that Venus nickname The Evening Star the writter put that piece of info about Venus becuase he is explaing how Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky which makes it simple for anyone to spot even a simple stargazer. The last point of evedince the writter used to suppports his claim is the dangerous part oif hsi calim he said that NASA has been studying how they are goinhg to send humnas to study VEnus but the dangerous part of that mission is the surface conditions.,2
01711c3,"Driveless cars can be a very great enhancement in the future's society. Driveless cars can save fuel, they have very high experience, and they contain many gadgets to hold itself together for a very long time.

First reason why driveless cars are a good enhancement to the society is that it would save money and time. ""He envisions a future with public transportation system where fleets of drivelss cars form a public-transport taxi system. The cars he forsees would use half of today's taxis and offer more flexibilty than a bus."" (Paragraph 1) Integrating a transportation system would save people's money for a bus pass, or even someone's time.

Second reason why driveless cars would help society because driveless cars have good experience on the road. ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" (Paragraph 2) Their has been very little accidents with driveless cars than there has been with humans driving cars.

Third reason why driveless cars are positive to the society is that the Google cars has many reasonable parts and technology to ""hold itself together."" ""Google modified Toyota Prius using position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, GPS receiver, and a inertial motion sensor. The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof, Dubbed LIDAR."" (Paragraph 4) The technology of all the input is great enough to acheive the skill of a human at the wheel.

Driveless cars can be very helpful to society. However, traffic laws writes that with a assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Feedback from the Google cars driving before 2009 spectulates that,""So far, they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveway or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" (Paragraph 2) Driveless cars don't have complete control over the car at all times, so drivers must still be focused at all times.

Driveless cars can be a great renaissance to the society. It will help save money, save time, and would be a great thing to tell our kids about.           ",3

Venus is the closest to the

planet to earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too . The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents .

The author is completely right because humans curiosity will lead you to many equally intimidating endeavors . The author wanting to do this study is not wrong some people will argue this and say this is not a good idea to put a human being life at risk . Agree to disagree because alot of people wants to know if theres life on many different planest such as Mars , Venus and maybe the dawf planet Pluto and maybe there is . The author supports his ideas with good points although risks are important to consider and its also an important factor in this because we dont want to send people just to die . The author said in paragraph 2 "" Since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours it explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades . "" Which means astronomers dont have very much to live .

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus you would have to wear a good good mask to be able to breathe . But theres even more challenging things like the clouds those aren't any type they have a highly corrosive sulfuric acid . These conditions are far way more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth . In paragraph 6 it states that "" researchers cannot take samples of rock gas or anything else from a distance "". So how are we going to know if theres life on planet Venus ? However many researchers are working on innovations that would allow machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus . NASA is also working on some other approaches to studying Venus . For example NASA worked some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide . They have been tested yes in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted atleast three weeks in such conditions .

Many ways are being created to do this study . Researchers have made this study easier and easier just a tiny bit . Modern computers are enormously powerful , flexible and quick but there more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions

exposing a cell or a phone its capable of melting . In conclusion Venus is a nice planet to do this study on . I'll even study and do some research myself .                                    ",3
907173a,"While getting your first car may feel like a wonderful thing, it leads to many not as wonderful situations such as having to constantly pay money for gas, repairs, and insurance, getting in wrecks, and having to worry about how to get places efficiently. there is an answer to these problems that has been in the making for years, this wonderful innovation in technology is called the driverless car. These cars will be able to drive anywhere without human assistance and will be open to the public much like taxis. They are safer and more economically effiecient than regular human-driven cars.

There will be no need to own cars anymore with the invention of this new car of the future. This means many great things for the saving of money. It means that people will no longer have to worry about paying for gas or repairs to their car, because they will not have a car. They instead will have free access to public driverless cars which will take them anywhere they want. this also means that people will not have to be responsible for such an expensive piece of equipment such as a car of their own.

Driverless cars will also make great bounds in the ideaology of vehicular safety. They will be equipped with many sensors and cameras on their exterior and interior to sense any danger and be able to prevent it in a moments notice without endangering anybody as recalled from paragraph four in the article. These cars will also be driving themselves, a situation that will take away the risk factors that are commonly associated with human-driven cars such as texting while driving and impaired driving due to alcohol or drugs. All of these factors lead to the conclusion that there will certainly be less and maybe even no wrecks with these amazing driverless cars.

Driverless cars will also make way for a much more economically efficient transportation system. As mentioned in paragraph one, these cars are said to consume about half as much gasoline as a normal human-driven car. This is in part due to the cars having a built-in GPS system that will guide the cars to the destination in the fastest possible route. Also, there are more economically friendly cars that are being sold now and these driverless cars will resemble those cars, but with even more economic efficiency and the extra perk of having the ability to drive itself.

All these perks of driverless cars are outstanding innovations in the technology of today, so why would we not take the opportunity to incorporate these into our daily lives?

Driverless cars are the future and the future is now, so out with the old human-driven cars and in the with the new, more economically efficient, safer, and cheaper driverless cars.",4
6ef3220,"When there is a decision on if I were to choose driverless cars or not, I am in the middle. I feel this advancement could greatly improve some safty hazards occuring now a days. Even though it may help in some situations, it still leads alot of room for disaster itself.

I feel as though was the driverless car could help is all the drunk drivers. With this advancement drunk drivers wouldn't be as much of a worry. They could get in the car and arrive to their destination as safetly as they would sober. If people were to take these cars we wouldn't have to worry about red lights and the car flying by running the red light about to hit you, or losing as much control. As long as the person in charge of the car can put in the right destination, I don't see why this would be such a problem. I feel the advancment would also lower the rate of texting and driving. Now if someone were to answer the phone or something they don't worry about losing control of what they are doing. The car would keep you on a safe path. The car would know about its surroundings with the spinning sensor they are talkin about. Would be able to keep everyone safe- people inside and outside the car.

Even though this may be very helpful, there are so many things that could go wrong. In the article they mentioned that the person would still need to pay attention, so they could take over at anytime. This could be very dangerous. What if the car notifies you that you need to take control, but there isn't enough time? Then what do you do? The person ""driving"" could also get very sleepy while they just sit there. If the person were to fall asleep and the car is needing them to take control, then they are going to wreck. People not having something to do can be boring and a hazard. You need them 100% focused, but it'll be like school. If they don't have enough entertainment or focus, they will be lost and not know what's going on. Another problem is that the car is all technology. At any minute your car could stop working or have a malfunction just like a smart phone. The car could need you to drive, but the notifier isn't working so you got in an accident. With this you could fight with the manufactutrer saying it's their fault and they think it's yours. This could cause serious arguements amongst people.

I believe there are great advancements that could come from this, but also some major issues. Nothing about this could 100% be safe but could be alittle safer than things right now. Either way this goes weither they make the cars or not, they should know they cacn fix the car all they want, but they can't fix the person ""controling"" it. ",3

6831c65,"Dear State Senator,

I am agreeing in favor of keeping the Electoral College. There is no need to change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. That is because the House of Representatiives helps elect for us, it helps us to balance our votes, and avoid problems of election. The Electoraal college helps the people out alot with the voting situation and helps us to better undrstand and know our new president.

The broader significance of the electoral College is that the House of Representatives helps us vote for our new president. In source One paragraph three it says ""Your state's entitled alloment of electors equal the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each number in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators....""That tells me that we the people are not alone in this process of voting who will be our next president. Also in the same source but paragraph five it states ""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party."" This informs me that not only the House of Representavtives is involved in the elections.  Tthe govenment is important to the Electoal College because the votes of the government count most to the College.

It is evident that the Electoral College helps us to balance our votes. As stated in Source Three ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" This lets me know that we -as the people- won't have to worry to much about the voting and selection of the president. Another peice of evidence stated in the same source and paragraph ""So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" That states that not all people and states have to worry about who the president will be. The Electoral College hepls us out alot mostly to the big states in the United States.

Above all the Electoral College avoid problems of the elections. In source Three, paragraph Twenty-two it states ""The Electoral College avoids problems of the elections in whcich no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast."" This lets us know that the Electoral College is doing a good job on keeping the votes clean and simple to understand. Also stated in the same source and paragraph ""There is no pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a moajoity of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential electionn process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which ivariably producess a clear winner..."" That tells me that the Electoral College is keeping the votes on point.

There are some people out there who don't agree with the Electoral College and dont like the way the votes are being put in because sometimes the president that they chose wasn't elected. They are wrong to disagree with the Electoral College because the College keeps everything going in order and in a clear path to let us know who our president will be. As stated in Source Two paragraph Ten ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in tur elect the president. This makes them disagree because they think that the Electoral College doesn't vote for their president, but they souldn't worry because they way they vote is by how many states helped the electors to vote for that presient being chosen as the president. Also In Source Two ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" That makes some people diagree also, but the Electoral College doesn't count how many people in each big or small state voted for president. All the college does is help the governmtent elect for the president that they most support and elect for.

I agree that the Electoral College should be kept in favor because of all the help that it gives us and the government. Also the College helps us stay balanced on the votes so that nothing gets missplaced or missunderstood. Most of all it avoids problems during the election so that the people and the government are satisfied with their votes. The Eletroal College is a great way to keep things going at a clear election of the year. The Electoral College doesn't need any changes for me because even if they chose on the elections of the government the votes of the people still count to them as well. The votes of the peopel are important to the Electoral College just as much as the government's votes are.             ",5
b337d19,"Dear Florida senator, we should keep the Electoral College. The Electoral College has been around for decades, produced by the founding fathers, it was made as a compromise between the two different ways the president should be elected. One way being by a slate of senators, and another by simply popular vote. It was made so that citizens could still have their vote, but more politically advanced senators could make a decision. The Electoral College is not only more efficiant but it lets the citizens keep their votes as well. I favor the Electoral College instead of popular vote because it helps avoid run-off elections, it uses the winner-takes-all method, and gives equal oppourtunity to smaller states.

Run-off elections, as known as, the gigantic issue with a popular vote election system. In 1968, Nixon, and in 1992, Clinton, both only had about 43 percent of the popular votes which was not enough. This is a problem because it complicates the presidential electon process. This is where the Electoral College comes in hand; the outcome of the votes becomes very clear this way. Instead of dealing with tricky numbers and percentages, the electoral college uses the ""winner-takes-all"" method. The winner-takes-all method is as literal as it sounds; the winner takes all. For example if someone was running for president and they got 301 votes and 370 electoral college votes, they would win (you only need a majority of 270 votes to be elected.

Lastly, using the Electoral College benefits smaller states. Think of this, you live in Maine, or Hawaii, or somewhere with a smaller population than Florida or California- your state would not have really that much of a impact on who wins the electon. Although, you cannot choose who your state senators in the end vote for, there's a greater chance of your state having a bigger impact. It naturally balences out some of the more heavier politically impacting states. Even though things are equal, in the long run larger states (population wise) will get more attention than states with a smaller population.

There are upsides and downsides to the Electoral College, but from a political perspective it is crystal clear that it is a better choice. Citizens for popular vote do believe it is unfair to the voters having a board of senators making the big vote/impact on the president, but those senators are highly trusted people who know what they're doing. I favor the Electoral College over popular vote because it helps avoid run-off elections, it uses the winner-takes-all method, and gives equal oppourtunity to smaller states.    ",4
1f0cbec,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming""

the author covers many points and facts about driverless cars. The author speaks about the advantages and disadvantages of the introduction of these cars. The author also speaks about the major companies making these cars from Google to Nissan. Nontheless driverless cars could prove to be unsafe, epensive, and have to many negative possibilites. These negative tradeoffs out weigh the possitive tradeoffs thus showing that introducing driverless cars would do more harm then good.

The article states ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and Pedestrians safe..."" The introduction of driverless cars would make this law harder to keep. This would be because the burden to be safe would no longer be in human hands but in the hands of a cumputer and some sensors. We have all had computers glitch or take a while to repond. It happens all the time. But then the safty of human life is in the hand of a computer it becomes somewhat disheartening. Weather conditions could also prove to be an issue with safty. Would there be a limit to how hot or how cold the environment would have to be for the sensors to work properly? With this much riding on the safty of human lives the driverless car seems to be a very unwise choice.

The answer on how expensive these cars would have to be is partly answered in paragraph six when the author states ""Radar was a device on a hilltpop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasent something you could buy at a Radio Shack."" If Radar back then was two hundred million dollars imagen how much a driverless car will be. Only the elite rich will be able to afford one and the majority of the popution will not. This shows that even if the driverless car was to come out in the near future only a handful of the population would have it since they would be the only ones who could afford it. But this also raises the issue with new roads since old ones would somewhat have to be updated in the long run. The article states that magnetic roads would be too expensive so smarter cars would be needed the roads would have to change a least a little to suit smart cars. With the many things that tax payer dollars are used for there would need to be an addition to smarter roads.

The negative possibilites of the introduction to smart cars are endless. The articel states "" in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This shows that law makers are fearful or the outcomes that some of these cars could create. Also the problem with the rise in law suit when these cars would get into an accident would also have to be put into account. The article adresses the problem of who would be to blame the driver or the maker of the car. Not only would this bring out more problems and law suits it would make it hard to find who was at fault. Also in the possiblity of an acccident if people were to be sleeping or watiching a movie responce time to move the car would be a varying constant from person to person showing that even if people were to get involved the chance to change the situation could be very slim.

WIth all of these negative situations

that driverless cars could cause it could be safe to say than the negative possibilites outweigh the positve possibilites. Driverless cars could prove to be unsafe, expensive, and have many negative possibilites. Showing that driverless are cars are not a very good idea.                ",5
5e2df05,"Greetings! I have heard that you think the Face on Mars, is a face that was created by aliens. I believe that this ""face"" is just a natural landform. I will support my claim why I think this, and maybe you will finally believe, that there are no such things as aliens.

There are many reasons why the Face is just a natural landform. On the second sentence paragraph, it says that we scientists have figured that the Face was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only that this one had unusual shadows, which made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. The reason some people think it look like an alien, was because it looked like a real face, but it looks like a face, because the shadows formed on the rock give off illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth. On paragraph 7, it is said that Machael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the origninal Viking phots. Later on, thoughsands of anxious web surfers were waiting for the image to appear. When it finally did, the site revealed a natural landorm. People were not satisfied, because it was a cloudy day on Mars. The scientists decided to prove that it was just a landform, so when it was not cloudy, they took another picture. In the final paragraph, paragraph 12, it says that what the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a btte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. A man name Garvin says, ""That's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The lava dome is most of Middle Butte in the Snake Riber Plaint of Idaho.

So, in conclusion, if you first thought that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, than I hope I have gave your enough information, and persuaded you that it is really just a natural landform. I am sorry if you thought it was made by aliens, but it wasn't. I hope that you could understand, and see that it was just the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.",3
18d261d,"In Vauban, Germany, the citizens are not allowed to own cars and if they do, they're parked on outskirts of the city or in garages at the end of their developments. The citizens walk and bike ride places, and they refrain from using their vehicle as much as possible. Overall, people are happier. They're getting more exercise and are being able to enjoy the outdoors and communicate with eachother more than if you were passing your neighbor in your car. It leaves the streets safer for the children and creates a more family-centered environment that the rest of Europe is starting to experiment.

Maybe your idea of a family centered area is one of spread out houses with private garages and cars but we can also create that by doing away with vehicles and removing them from our environment.

In Paris, vehicles were banned for a period of time because the of smog content in the city. If citizens did not comply to this order they were to be fined and your vehicle could be impounded. The increase use of motorized vehicles by mass pollutes cities and makes it unsafe to breath the air.

7ab5932,"well lets talk about the cons first since were at it, first the cost for driverless cars are going to be out rageous and with that most people will not be able to get them. while that was only one problem the other is that taxi drivers would be fired as who wants someone they have to pay for driveing people around when they could pay once and never have to pay again for the same thing. as for the laws mass law change would cuase some problems and one thing they brought up which is very true if these driverless car were truely driverless who would have to pay if some one got in a wreak or accident and ended up kill or injuring someone.

now lets talk about the pro's of having driverless cars, less fuel is wasted now that is great becuase as we all know petrolium is rather expensive since the world only has so much and if would could figure out a way to use solar energy, the cars could truly be revolutionizing and make all the diffrence. just like in the artical it would truly have more flexability than a bus which would revolutionize transportation and even help thos people who know very little about where they are and where they need to go. it would also majorly decrease the amount of crashes and most likly if it works like how they say it'll work than we could almost swear there would be no crashes.

all in all i think that this idea is facinating and very intersting but it does have its problems, if you look at it from the view of people, opinions change but what i think will never change i believe that it would be great to an extent now im not saying its terrible but instead of less fuel, why not just make the cars solar powered and make sure there is no toxins being released into the air, i remmeber reading some where that we use billions of gigawatts of power, and the sun makes that same amount of power in one second so if we could use solar power we could truly have a gas free would. on to the main i think it is a good idea.",3

But can a computer compet against the human mind? After many of learning/performing the same task that a computer can do to figure human emotions and such? I think not!

First thing, I'll like to point that yes, Dr. Huang created a computer software to,""Precisely enough to convey specific emotions."", but you gotta think, computer can mess up. Emotion's can not only be indicated my facial expression, but also tone of the individual. Plus, is it really a big deal to spend money to figure out different peoples emtion when we can simple just look at them, and say, ""Hey!

He/She looks quite upset."".

Secondly, I'll like to point out that, what the hassle to make a program, when a normal ""Home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode"" emotions. This can even done even better by just looking at a mirror and just copying down their exact facial expression to figure out how they were feeling, and wasting time to encode and create a software to see different types of emotions that could possible fail at doing.

I'm not saying that computer shouldn't be able to perform task humans do always, like there are time where this can sorta useful. For example from the text,""Make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games... communications."" having some benefits. But just for seeing facial features for emotions, we could easily do that on our own.

They should have it in schools because it will give the teachers an idea on how their students emotions are. It should be in schools because not all the students tell the teachers if they understand it ir not this will tell them. Most students would not use the communication with their teavhers and if they have this maybe this will help them when they don't understand it.

It can hurt them by not communicating with their teacher. Most students would say oh well you never asked if i understand this or not that way the schools should have this. It's also going to be a new change to see what works and don't work. Changing it up a little bit would be a good way to get other new ideas. If the schools start using it maybe it will even be a bigger sale if the marjority of schools use it.

The passage says it could ""modify the lesson"" meaning it could be a lesson. This computer can tell when a kid is getting confused or bored meaning just lost interst in it.

Saying like if the student is scared to say out loud that he or she didnt get it. If the student lost interst in it then the teacher could maybe find a way that it wouldn't be so boring for that student. This doctor Huang thinks it a very good idea for schools and other things.

What would other indivauals say about this do you know. The only bad thing would be the money unless the school get like a discount or something like that. Maybe it can turn your childs mood a new whole way and a new out look on things. Most parents and teachers think the schools should have it in their buildings.",3
e44478f,"Dear State Senator,

I agrue in favor of keeping the Electoral College, for this reason it wouldhave to be the fact that it is a much easier method electing presidental canditates. At times I know it can be unfair to most of the voters around the nation but this way is more easier than it might already seem. Instead of the people voting for which they think is the new president, it would be more likely the electors who elect the president for the state. These slate of electors are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. For some states it wouldn't be just random it be either democratic, or republicians. When having the electors it wouldbe possible to be the winner of the electoral vote but not the national popular vote.

For the president's chance of winning having an Electoral College will exceed his share of popular vote. An example would be the election backin 2012, Obama had 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared 6to what Romeny had because most of the states awarded the eletoral votes on the winner-take-all basis, can get a chance of having victory in winning the electoral vote. But there would be a possible chance of having a tie against the states.

Another reason for this debate would have to be the reason that the candidates themseveles have to get the regional appeal from the states. For Romeny that gave him an opporunity but had little to offer. He no electoral votes in the states that he knowshe will win. For this unsuccessful result, Romeny only had regional appeal there for he was less likely to successed in the southern region. For other states that felt as if their votes didn't count, so there for assumed that Romeny had little interest, leading to the thought of an unlawful candidate. Swing states on the other hand have a chance of making it. The reason for that being is voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign knowing that they are going to decide the election. On avergae they are are thought of as the most thoughtful voters (the result is that they have recieved more information and attention from the candidates.

Electoral Colleges balance the weight in political balance that larger states lose virtue of the Senate. For Obama he won that vote based on the amount of electoral votes he recieved from Florida was 29. Also 3 from the state of Wyoming. In other reasons, larger states recieve the most attention from the candidates than the small states do.

Based on the information I have provided you in this statement, I will concluded that sometimes this method can be a little complicated to most voters in the U.S. For the reason is that most of the smaller states remain unseen by the candidates of the elections but sometimesend up winning thepopluar vote for the candidate they chose. In the beginning in starting the Electoral College was held by our founding fathers of this great nation. There for this methodshouldremain as it should. Thank you for your consideration.

d3c5dd7,"Dear Mr./Ms. Senator,

I think it would be a good idea to change the election by popular vote for election of our president. It would be a good idea for a few reasons. One it doesn't fully represent the people, (or general population.) For example, Persident Obama in the 2012 election only recieved 51.3% of the population vote. However because of the Electoral College, he was able to become the president of the United States. And us, the voters, well we aren't even voting for our president. According to source two,

The Indefensible Electoral College , "" Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" So us the people aren't even voting, do our votes really even count? Say i live in a state like Maine, then i only have 4 electoral votes, oppose to a big state like Texas, who according to the map in the third source have ""38 electoral votes"". My vote really doesnt even count. Because of the amount of votes your state gets in the upcoming election relys on the population. But every state only gets one final vote. so say Wyomming gets just as many votes as Texas, who represents 35 million voters. Do you see how this is unfair? And then theres the ""Disaster Factor"", This can destroy anyones chances at becoming president. It happened in the 60's it happened in the 2000 election, it can happen anytime. The Disaster factor is when repressentatives vote for whom ever they please. When this happened in the 60's rasists almost succeded in a plan to bump President Kennedy from the office. they were going to replace all the electors with different people to go up against Kennedy. The electors can bassically do what ever they please, considering we voted them in. They casn defy us as much as they please. In the 1968 election, just a mere 8 years after the would be catastropy of the segragationists, a tie, yes a tie, almost occured. It was about 10,000 votes away form a ""deadlock tie"". According to the second source, "" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" They basically told the swing voters to take it off their hands and vote for who they pleased. These are just a few of the reasons why The Electoral College is Outdated and needs the be repalced.

5466263,"I stand with the makeing of these cars and the possiblities that come with in our society. The cars would be able to open new doors to health benefits, lowering crash ratios, and much more. The driverless car would be a great achievement in human curisosity and invention. These cars would better many different levels of society if made and used propely.

Drverless can be an innovation within our cumminties and cites. These cars could protect more lives and lower the amount of human recklessness that could be done at the wheel of a regular driven car. If made fully driverless, the amount of intoxicated accidents, killing and pull overs by the police would be lowered substancially. These smart cars could detect when their driver is not keeping a minimal amount of focus on the road and alert them to any dangers that could obstruct their path or cause harm. Only increasing the level of safety and efficencess that it would be used for.

The support of the driverless car ,though at the moment is not completely driverless, could keep many citizens safe and out of harm. The public eye sees these cars of dangerous because they do not wish to relinqiush their right of control over to the car and also they do not know what would replace the fun of driving in its stead. The makers have a few ideas on how to make the trip fun, but still lawmakers are trying to decide whether to trust that these cars are really that safe and how big their laws would ned to change for traffic, and the last big question who will take the blame for a crash that may happen. The safety issues are slowly being proven to the lawmakers on that it may be a better option then regular cars, but the other previously said descions have yet to be acted upon, except for its questioning.

I do believe driverless cars if thought through and corrected for mistakes can become a valuable asset to modern day community. These cars could lead to a increase in driving, and traveling for families and could also lead to the question of what can we do with this technology now? I feel that these questions are a very good thing in the advanceing technology of this age and that the still developing cars should not be frowned upon, but seen as a step forward into atoumating our country.",3
e2a98c7,"I do not believe driverless cars are a good idea.

In my opinion they are more dangerous than human drivers.

Although I also know that people will creat driverless cars no matter the danger becuase people are selfish and they want to be rich and everyone respect them.

What better way to do that better than inventing something as high tech as a driverless car.

I believe these cars are dangerous becuase they can't drive under certain circumstances.

In paragraph seven, it states that in work zones or around accidents a human would need to take over.

If it is suppose to be ""driverless"" then it should be able to drive through work zones and such with needing help.

If it needs a human driver's help then it isn't driverless.

Also in paragraph seven, it states that drivers must be alert if they need to take over.

Everyone knows this, Americans are lazy.

That's why we have cars and we don't bycicle everywhere.

Americans don't want a car so they have to stay alert more about the road.

They want a robot to drive so they don't have to focus on the road.

So they can sleep, eat, or get ready for work in the car.

I also believe that the last thing the world needs is more pollution.

These cars may or may not take up less gas but they still use gas, which means they still polute just like any other car.

If a company comes out with a driverless car and it's a hit then that company is going to polute the are with smoke and chemicals trying to build all these cars to meet the supply of the demand.

The world already has enough factories poluting the world, why add more?

But what do I know?

I'm just some kid taking a stupid Istep test at school.

Wrong.

I'm a kid of the next new generation.

My generation will be the one's to clean up what the adults left behind that is destroying earth.

Or we'll ignore it like the generations before us then our great grand babies will die from polution or the effects of global warning.

I don't like the idea of driverless cars.

Technology always messes up one way or the other.

But that's just my opinion against many others.        ",3
26cbb50,"The system of Electoral College is being always used in Presidental elections every first Thursday in November, hapenning in a space of fours years each electio. According with the text: ''What Is the Ellectoral College?'', the Office of the Federal Register explain that on this system, there's a ''selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress'', this group has 538 electors.

The biggest problem with this system is that you do not vote directly to your president, you are voting for a candidate's electors. The real decision is not made by the people of the society themselves, but made by a group of people who whave the freedom to choose the candidate that they feel pleased with. Another point is that some of this electors don't even vote for their paty's candidates.

If it doesn't look like a big deal, first it's important no analyze the profile of the electors, the ones who decide the future of our country and the authorty of our nation. Do they have something special? Something that differenciate them for the other voters? Actually no! There's no criterion, according with Bradford Plumer in '' The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong'', the selection of the electors ''depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central comitee, sometimes the presidental candidates themselves''.

The last point is that the few electors can't represent the will of a whole state, in ''The Indefensible Electoral College'', shows that just 55 representatives from California, represent 35 million voters, it's impossible to attend the rights of each one of these people.

After all, we need to realize that it's a unfair system for regular voters, for the population in general that has the expection of changing something, but actually are being controled for a group. Sometimes, a candidate won the popular vote but lost the presidency during the electors decision. Democracy should look at the opinion of everybody else right? But in this case what is happening goes against the definition of democracy.    ",3
b0cfaaf,"Dear Mr or Ms Senator,

Presient Richard Nixon, and President Bill Clinton both have something in common; they won their presidencies with the Electoral College, not the popular vote. (According to ""In Defense of the Electoral College: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. Paragraph 22) Richard and Bill only won 43% of the popular vote against their opponents while they were running for office. This is why the United States needs to keep the Electoral College instead of switching to the popular vote for the elections.

Now you're probably wondering, does high school students even know what the Electoral College is and what it's job? Yes, high school students do know what the Electoral College is and what it does. The Electoral College is made up of 538 electors. Your state amount equals one member from the House of Represenatives and two from the Senate. The electors are chosen from the candidate's political party. The Electoral College decides the president and vice president every four years every Tuesday ater the first Monday in the month of November.

Mr or Ms Senator, the Electoral College needs to stay instead of the popular vote because when you have the Electoral College you will get an outcome from it unlike the popular vote. Almost all states have the ""winners take all"" method which according to ""What is te Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Regisiter (Paragraph 7) this method is when all electors are awarded to the presidental candidate that is winning. Also the popular vote overrides the popular vote. In ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner (Pararaph 18) the 2012 presidental campaign for example it was the battle between Mitt Romney who is a Republican against Barack Obama who is a Democrat. Obama received only 51.3 percent of the popular vote and Obama got 61.7 percent of the Electoral College. As you can see the Electoral College overrided the popular vote which ultimately made him president. Also in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the Presiden"" (Paragraph 22)take Richard Nixon's and Bill Clinton's presidental campaign. Those two only won 43% of their popular votes but they won their elections with the Electoral College. Without the Electoral College all three of these presides wouldn't have become President of the United States.

To continue on, the Electoral College should stay instead of the popular vote since one region of the United States doesn't have enough power of the Electoral Votes to make a presidental candidate win. Look at ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" Mitt Romney doesn't campaign in the South part of the United States since he knows that he is popular in that region with the electors he doesn't bother camapigning there since he knows he will win their votes. But he has to campaign to other states and regions since he knows the South doesn't have enough power to make him president. And with that comes your swing states and the big states. Swing states listen to what the presidental candidates have to say since they are toss-up states. These swing states literally can ""swing"" the election. These are the states that are going to decide who the next president is. And that ties in with your big states; California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania are some of your big states since they have the most population out of the United States. These states can also be swing states since they have the most votes out of every state. With the power of the popular vote a presidental canidate can become president, and other regions will not have a say. But using the Electoral College that can't happen.

On the other hand, according to ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" (Parargraph 14) the Electoral is outdated, irrational, and unfair. In ""The Inefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer key names such as Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerece all want to get rid of the Electoral College and use the Popular Vote. Look at the presidency that was in 2000 with Al Gore against George W. Bush. Al Gore would have won the election if the election was based on the popular vote. He won the popular vote with over 60%! But unfortunately, he didn't win and lost to George W. Bush since Bush won the Electoral College votes. But some people don't really know what they are voting for in election which is why the Electoral College is the way to go. Also people complained with the ""winners take all method"" some candidates don't go to certain states and only focus on the swing states. In the 2000 campaign seventeen out of fifty states didn't see the candidates. But the candidates didn't go to those states since they knew they had no chance of winning those states and they needed to focus on the swing states to make sure they win the election. Many people do call the Electoral College an anachronism, but it doesn't need to stick in the past, it needs to be kept in the present and in the future.

Ultimately, Mr or Ms Senator, the United States needs to keep the Electoral College instead of the popular vote because you will always have an outcome and one region can't overpower another and make a candidate win the presidental campaign. Yes, as said before many people want to get rid of the Electoral College but it will stay with the United States and move forward with us people.

I dont think it is very fair that you tell people there vote counts but what a lot of people dont know is that it doesn't. Instead it consists of 538 electoral voters who use the majority rule to elect the president. There are millions of voters who are just wasting there time on election day voting on who they think should be president. Did you know over 60 percent of voters prefer a direct election over a electoral college. 60 percent!

That's majority rule right there and you still havn't done anything about it. When people vote they are voting for the president not for a slate of electors. Not only is that false advertising but it's wrong. Vote for president Obama the signs say but do they really mean it? I guess not.

Just think if you were a voter and you thought it counted. i think you should change from the electoral college to the popular vote. Look what the electoral college has made for presidents over the past century. George Bush went to war with irag and Afghanistan making us far into dept. Then they voted for Obama who is taking over 20 TRILLION DOLLARS from China, and how does he expect to pay them back?

Very simple, he is just gonna brush it off like nothing is happening and wait for re-election and pass the dept off to the new president. So, if popular vote was now going on i think the public would be better at deciding whether or not one person deserves to be president more then the other. Ill let you decide.

At the same time, it is also no surprise that there are hurdles that must be jumped over in order to devleop these machines.

In spite of the roadblocks the development process may encounter, it is important that self-driving cars become a reality.

When thinking about inventions, one must think, why are these things invented in the first place?

The answer is simple: convenience.

For almost any invention that can be thought of, it can be concluded that the main purpose of the invention is to make our lives easier.

The car is a percect example of this. It makes long distance travel easier and much quicker than on foot or by horse.

However, the act of driving a car is a dangerous one.

A person is basically driving a 2,000 pound hunk of metal that is hurdling at fast speeds down a road.

Frankly, there is nothing safe about that idea.

However, if cars were self-automated, automobile travel would be much safer, as it takes the human error out of the equation, reducing accidents and mishaps on the road.

Though the car would be self-driving, a human would be needed in case of an emergency situation, in which the car would not be able to function properly.

As stated in the 7th paragraph of the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" , BMW has already tried its hand at self-automated cars, and have developed a system in which the car drives itself, but requires a person's hands to be on the wheel at all times, in case of an emergency.

This way, the driver would not be totally at the mercy of the computer system in the car in the time of emergency where human intervention is necessary.

Some may say that if self-driving cars were to be a common finding in life, roads and driving laws would need to be changed considerably.

For example, in most states (save for California, Nevada, Florida, and Washington D.C.), testing self-driving cars is not even legal.

These people are right, but it is not a reason to deter the development of these machines.

When the automobile first came to market at the turn of the 20th century, roads fit for automobile travel and driving laws in general did not exist, as there had not been cars before that.

Nowadays, we have highly sophisticated driving laws and road systems.

This shows that it is not impossible to create new laws to deal with new technology as it is invented, and subsequently integrated into modern society.

Car companies such as Tesla, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz have plans to release self-driving cars in the future. However, it is important that the development of self-driving cars continues, as it is a vital and necessary step in technological progression that should occur.

Not only would it make driving a safer and less stressful act, it is just a logical progression as far as technology and innovation is concerned.

It would usher in a new era of innovation, that could only make our lives better.

After all, is that not the point of any invention?",5
d9c628d,"In the article ""Making Mons Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enable computers to identify human emotions. I disagee about using of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

Technology, such as phones, laptops, or any devices, is not always true. They can predict about how people feel or their emtions. For example, in the second paragraph in the first sentence, it says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"".

Every people have different types of emotions. It's true that they have different kinds of emotions but what if it is fake? Computers are like robots. Computers can't prefer if someone is smiling or upset. Computers don't understand if someone is really smiling for real or faking smiling. It depends on someone's face. For instance, when a friend talk something fun, I smile but when a friend talk something boring, I smile too so they can be happy.

Is putting on a happy face actually work? I prefer not because it depends on someone's emotions inside instead of the outside. Not everybody can read someone's mind. In the last paragraph in the second sentence, it says, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"".

It can be true, but it can be false. People don't know what is going to happen next. So people have to figure out on their own. So I disagree that about using of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.",2

The another positive aspects of this driverless cars are that it can save fuel as half of today's taxis and offer more flexiblity than a bus. It will save money for building another car or perhaps save fuel for the world. For the ability to move around as much more than the bus it can be a time saver if anyone is in a rush.

The nagative aspects of the car is that what if the technology fails and whose fault is that. Is the driver or the manufacturer's fault? Here in the article it says, "" Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who fault is that---the driver or the manufacturer?""

The another negative aspects is that it still cost a millions of dollars to build this new technology car. Here in this article it says that, "" The sensors weren't there, the computers weren't there, and the mapping wasn't there. It wasn't something you could buy Radio Shack.""

My conclusion is that we must wait till the development reaches safety level to even commercial it to the world. ",2

Everyone, whether old, young, tall, or short, have an opinion. In America, we have many amendments protecting us so we can share our opinions with whomever we want. However, the electoral college is flat out taking away our right to share our thoughts about the future leaders of the nation. The electoral college is irrational, and unfair.

The most basic reason why the electoral college is unfair to our country is because not everyone is fairly represented. For example, there are 55 representatives in California to represent 35 million voters. As you can see, it is an unfair ratio. It is impossible for the House's votes to reflect the views of the people in California. That also means that since each state only has one fianl vote, a state such as Wyoming, who has 500,000 voters, would have as much say as California, with 35 million. California has more people, and my making every state have equal representation, it is messing up representation in states like California.

In the system we have today, it is very easy to have a dealocked election. In 1968, a mere 41,971 votes would have caused a major deadlock in the election. The same thing happened again in 1976, if 5,559 votes in Ohio and 3,687 votes in Hawaii decided to vote differently. In both cases, and few thousand votes could have caused a serious disaster. History tends to repeat itself, so if the almost exact situation happened in the span of less than ten years, what makes you think it won't happen again?

The electoral college creates an unfair system to gaining votes. In 2000, 17 states, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, who are home to some of the largest media markets, didn't even get the chance to see a campaign ad. If you were a canidate, wouldn't you want your ad to be seen in the some of the largest media markets? The canidates had already thought they won those states, which is a ignorant move to make. Because of the electoral college, and the unspoken rules that have been set in place about certain states views, the canidates missed a greatly helpful opprotunity to gain more votes.

However, many might think that the electoral college is a good system because it gives a clear winner, and it makes the states have equal representation. If the people are barely being represented, and a state with less than a million voters has as much say as a state with 35 million voters, then it doesn't matter if the process gives a clear winner. The people want to have a say, not someone choosing for them.

The electoal college may have been a good idea back when it was first created, however, times are changing and the number of people being able to vote is growing day by day. The voters want to give their opinion through voting, and by having the electoral college in place, it is making voting unfair, irrational, and nearly impossible to do.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely, PROPER_NAME           ",5
f9d9962,"Have you ever heard about the face on Mars' surface? People think that it could be aliens, but more people believe that it is just a mesa or a butte. The Viking 1 gathered the first pictures of the face ever. Many conspiracy theorists think that NASA knows that it is evidence of an ancient alien race. It still remains somewhat a mystery to people all over the internet.

The Viking one captured the first pictures of the face in history. It was searching for landing spot for it's sister ship. The mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab were surprised when it popped up on their monitors. The pictures surfaced on the internet a few days later. It was a great way to get people engaged in the attraction to Mars.

Although NASA and conspiracy theorists would be happy to discover that the face is evidence of an ancient alien race on Mars. The formation is probably just a mesa or a butte. They are both landforms common to the American West. Garvin commented'' It reminds me of a Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.''A lava dome that takes form of a mesa around t he same height as the one Mars.

If the face on mars was an alien artifact NASA would be famous for finding it.

Conspiracy theorists say that NASA is hiding the fact that the face is an alien artifact,but NASA would not be hiding the fact that it is from aliens if it were because it would benefit them a bunch. For example they could make a ton of money from the publicity of it being something alien. With the money they could fund even more projects like sending rovers to Mars to try and find out more about the face, and maybe they could even be able to get humans to Mars. It would get people interested in Mars and they would want more pictures and evidence of it being an alien artifact. That is why it would not make sence for NASA to tell people on the internet that the face is an something alien instead of just being a mesa or a butte.

In conclusion there is a lot more evidence that the face is a mesa or a butte other than an alien artifact. Even though conspiracy theorists are convinced they have proof of alien lifeform. Most evidence points to it being a landform, like a mesa or a butte. There is also not any logical reason for NASA to hide the idea that it is evidence of aliens if it were true. These are just a few of the reasons that I believe that it is just a landform and not any evidence of an alien lifeform. The rest of the internet should realize that it is not anything alien too.",4
2e43866,"Lately I've been hearing these rumors about driverless cars. Come to find out that its not even a rumor; Its true. Just the sound of driverless cars sounds so cool right? I mean just think about it, no more driving! Well it does sound cool but, let this thought of driveless cars really sink in.

First, i know that all these action movies has the floating cars, driverless cars, and all that other decent stuff but, i didn't think they would really try to make this happen. Driverless cars do sound pretty intresting but, is it safe? I mean accidents are still going to happen but, when they do who will we know who did it. If our generation doesn't learn how to drive cars no more than that would make us less adapatable then normal. It's unecessary to build driverless cars. There will be no excitement at all for the ones who just got their license. How will we get to where we need to be on time if we are in a rush.

Next, making driverless cars would cause mayham. Realize that if a car could drive itself then that would make people less prepaired for when an accident might occur. Since the car is driving itself this means that drunks won't get introuble because they not driving so a persons drunk and they get in a ccidnet you can't blame the drunk driver because he wasn't driving so then when court come around its just gone be a room full of curious people still trying to figure out who to blame. Also this means that any age would have acces to an vehicle. Imagine waking up to your 3 year baby gone and your car. It's three in the morning and your baby just driving your car down the street.

In conclusion having driverless cars can be a factor in safety and money. Next thing you know people gone start comig up with dumb ideads like pets that speak English. Some things are just unecessary, we need to invent things that people need not want. Maybe driverless cars aren't as bad. I just lied they are bad.",3
f0dbde2,"Cars during this time are banned from Vauban, Germany. Many reasons why they had a this ruling over cars. To have a home in Vauben, Germany, you have to give up your own car to own a house in that area. Till this day, Vauban, Germany have still hade the rule to not have cars in that area. People nowadays want towns like Levittown and Scarsdale which is located in New York.

Paris is another city who had banned cars for a period of time. Due to smog Paris needed to limit the use of cars and only use buses and taxis for transportation. If you broke the law and useed your car, you had to pay a fine off 22 euros ($31). Paris and Beijing, China were neck at neck with the worlds most polluted cities. This was a difficult time during the east coast of thr world.

In Bogota, Colombia during a car-free day people would skate, take buses, biked , hiked, etc. Peolpe who violated this rule would have to pay a $25 fine. Bogota only did that to reduce pollution and smog from the air. The majority of the people did not care abou t not taking cars as transportation. They enjoyed going outside to walk to places and to enjoy the weather even if it was cloudy or raining.

The United States is trying to be more efficiant and trying not to use cars as much. People who are being ""green"" use the diesel gas to fill up there car. They also love to car pull people. Some of them do not even use cars to transport themselves to other places, some use horses, skateboarding, biking, etc.                      ",1
e5d8f53,"I don't think driverless cars are really that important. It's interesting, and would be cool but not important. I believe a lot of people would buy them. The purpose of driving is supposed to be exciting for you, instead they're driving for you. All together they're not important, dangerous, could cause accidents, but could be interesting.

Driverless cars are not important, I believe that just driving regularly is better that the car doing it for you. There are still cars that people could drive just fine. I don't see why people would want their car to drive for them.

Driverless cars could cause accidents. I think if a careless teen would be driving it, they could think that car would be doing all the work. They would think that they don't need to focus. There are already problems with texting a driving, imagine if they thought they could text because the car is doing all the work. In the article it says that the car needs you to be alert at all times incase they come across work zones. I think that could cause accidents.

I believe that many people are careless drivers. People could get used to the idea of the car taking care of everything, in the article it says that the car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. Which could cause people to do things they could never do if they had to pay attention at all times. Someone could be paying attention to other things in the car instead of steering and cause an accident.

The thought of driverless cars is very interesting, I would be more accepting of them if I knew they were safe, and no one would get hurt. Someone who's been driving for a long time, I think would be more interested in it. New drivers who aren't used to driving would probably want to drive by themselves. I think the driverless car could be very useful to people who take trips that are far, and need to relax.

Overall, I think the driverless car isn't important, dangerous, could cause accidents, but could be interesting. I personally wouldn't want one, but others might be very interested. It could cause accidents to happen, especially if the driver is careless. It is an interesting invention though, the idea of having a car drive for you is cool. But I don't think it's worth the risk.    ",3

So having this machine woud not be good to have because some teacher could be nosy and ask why are you mad or sad. The machine cold also tell if your lying.

Sometimes you got to lie, so you could be left alone. Students would probably skip school because of this machine. Lots of schools will be empty because students do not want teachers to know about them. This machine could be used in pictures or face portates to see how the person in the picture is feeling, but to use it on students then no.

The police could use this machine to find out if criminals are lying about what they did. Parents would also be mad that teachers are using the machine on their children. There is no point of teachers using this machine. They do not need to know how your feeling at all. The teacher only us it for a reason or when nessasary not when they just feel like it. ",2

f67f226,"I think that using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in their classroom is valuable. It is valuable becuase it can show when a student is losing interest or becoming bored or even if they are confused. it would be able to show the pace the student is learning and how comfortable they are with it.

Teachers should be able to use the Facial Action Coding System becuase it can help the students stay more focused instead of just sitting there and letting the information go into one ear and out the other. It can help the teachers be able to keep students on task.

Another reason why this technology might be a good idea for teachers in their classrooms is it can help showing when a student might not get the material or they might be confused and not understand what they are working on. With the help of the Facial Action Coding System, it can help the student get more help from teachers and their grades might even go up because it is showing the teachers how they are truly feeling in that class.

The last reason why I agree with having the Facial Action Coding System is valuable is because it can show when the students are ready ti move onto the next thing because they are comfortable enough with the material. It shows the students are ready for the next thing. It could also help tell if the class is too easy and the student might need an advanced class or the things they are learning are too challenging for them.

This Facial Action Coding System is valuable in many ways. It may not be the most important thing to have in the classroom but it will help with putting the students with what they are ready and comfortable enough with to learn.",4
c589dc1,"Was there life on Mars? Around 25 years ago, NASA's spacecraft named, Viking 1, was in search for the sister ship, Viking 2. While searching, they spotted on Mars, something in the form of a human face! Could it be signs of Aliens on Mars? It seemed to be looking at

a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Among the mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab, there must have a number of people shocked to see face on their moniters. It was sensational while it lasted. Scientes firgured it to be another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia.

NASA decided to show the rest of the world what they had seen.

02d481d,"Dear, Senator

The

Electoral college has been around for centuries and as time changes, things start to evolve and grow along with the time period.

Some things are meant to be changed according to the lifestyle of our people now. Hundreds of years back, the electoral college might have worked for the citizens living during that time. However, this is a new century and many people agree with the fact that the electoral college is out dated and we need to change to the election by popular vote. Firstly, because the people are putting their vote into the hands of a person whom they might not even consider the votes of their state's people . Also, the electoral college causes many issues duing the voting period.

To start off, The electoral college is a huge risk that the state's people must take each year.

You never know whether or not your electors will suddenly change their mind and vote for a candidate that you personally didn't want. In the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" Bradford Plumer states ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get cofused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" (Plumer Paragraph 10) What the author is explaining is that during the presidential election, once you vote on your selection for the next president and you give your vote to the state electors you never know if they might change their mind or get scared and choose the incorrect candidate. For example, you choose on Barack Obama for president and you give your vote to the state electors and when it's time to vote... they decide to switch and choose

HILARY CLINTON!

Many of the citizens who voted for Barack Obama are now outraged by the thought of their state electors doing such a thing.

If we had elections by popular vote we would be able to choose whom we specifically want for our President and there wouldn't be so much tension between people.

Furthermore, the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system ae wrong"" Bradford explains ""Back in 1960, Segregationists in the Louisinna legislaure nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors whoo would oppose John F. Kennedy."" This quote from the article is saying that the electors could easily manipulate you and change their votes in order to get what they want, forgetting about all the other votes of the people back home waiting for the news that their selection has won the presidency.

The elecoral college completely demolishes the purpose of the people's vote.

Additionally, electoral colleges should be abolished because not everyone feels as strongly about it as they did hundreds of years ago when the process first came about. What had started out as a good idea has slowly turned into a unpredictable disaster. From time to time,

People would be let down when they find out that  the candidate they had chosen didn't win the election, Why? because their state electors decided that it was okay for them to simply go against everyone else and be selfish by choosing their own candidate for presidency.

Bradford proves this by explaining ""...'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" (Plumer Paragraph 11) On multiple occasions voters have done exactly that, choosing someone completely different than whom they were supposed to. Many members of the party get angry with such childish behavior because it's selfish, uncalled for, and just disrespectful to go about ignoring the one major duty they had to cast a vote for their selected candidate. The article ""In defense of the electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" Richard A. Posner exclaims ""The electoral college is widely regarded as a anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner."" (Posner Paragraph 15) What the author is explaining is that the electoral college is an old custom and it's time that it was changed to something new like the election by popular vote.

Time has changed, an so has the political veiws. The election by popular vote is a better opportunity because the state's people get to vote on exactly who they want without any major risks to deal with later on. Also, the election by popular vote is a simple and easier way of electing president.

On the other hand, there are very few reasons that are pointing towards the electoral college being a good idea. For example,

The electoral college has a even number of votes which make it easier to have a more predictable outcome of who might win the election. Although, not everyone might get the candidate that they had hoped for originally. The electoral college also comes along with the ""Winner-take-all"" method in which the awarding electoral votes induces the candidates running for the presidency.

However, this is only based on the candidate that has the most popular votes.

There are various reasons to consider the electoral college but many of them are followed by an overload of reasons

NOT

to keep the electoral college in use.

Lastly, the election by popular vote should be used instead of the electoral college. The electoral college comes along with many complications and difficulties unlike the election by popular vote it has a simple and easier way of choosing who you want in the next presidency. Many people feel that you should change over to the election by popular vote to benefit all of the state's people so that they can have a more acurrate estimation of who they  might have as their new president.

According to Bradford, the electoral college is ""...Unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Plumer paragraph 14) It's about time we got rid of it and changed the way we elected our new president.    ",6
beae3b7,"Luke was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. When his friend Don asked him to go on a cattle boat Luke couldn't say no. It was and opportunity of a life time and Luke knew it. In 1945 the World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins.44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Rlief and Rehabilition Administration).They hired seagoing cowboys to take care of all the animals. So Luke and Don signed up.

In August 1945,they received an order to go to New Orleans. They arrived on the 14th of August the day the pacific war ended says Luke. They got there papers and got a boat called the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed towards Greece. They were delivering 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. Be for they got to Greece Luke turned 18 years old. That ment that he could be drafed at any time to go to war. When he told them that he was on a cattle-boatr trip they told him to do it for the Military Service. Luke had made nine trips that more then any seagoing cow boy has ever made.

The cattle boat trip was an alsome trip for a small town boy Luke say. besides helping people he also got to see different countries like all of Europe and China but when he saw Acropolis in Greece it was special to him Luke says. It toke Luke and Don abount two weeks to crose the Atlantic ocean from the eastern coast that is a long time on water non stop that would make me sick and never ride a boat again but sometimes you have to do things you dont want to do.

When Luke was little he helped his aunt Katie's farm ou when he was a boy and he has worked hard ever since that is my dream is to work on a farm. It did not teach him the dangers of the sea though. When he was on his secened trip he was a night watchman. He had to check on all of the animals every hour and that was easy i bet because of him helping on a farm when he was a kid that was the same but it was on a boat. When he was reporting to the captin one time he slipoed and fell on the ground and a peice of meatal stop him from going over board.

So that was my eassy on Luke and his life I really liked this story alot i would have wrote more but i am about out of time so thats all i got.

All of our devolpment since World War II has been centered on the car and that will have to change ,"" said David Golberg. Now this is true, cars have been a fluenctal idea  for  transportation. Cars is known to be the fastest way of transportatin, but maybe limiting car usage can be helpful. Theres thousands of alternatives like bicking, skating, running, ridding a bus, or even a train. limiting car usage would save the money you use on gas, reduce the ammount of polution in our atmosphere, and is more healthy for your body. Heres my explanation to why limiting car usage would be a productive idea.

Our nation spends millons on gas each week, limiting car usage would save that money. The amount of money people spend on gas is astonishing. Limiting car usage by taking a buss or even using a bike could save that money. In my community there is this parking lot for buss takers, this way people can save money on gas and still get to there destination on time. Another advantage to limiting car usage is that it will reduce polution.

Polution is a huge problem not just for Europe or North America, but for the entire world. According to source 2 ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" In France they use diesel fuel which is the most polluted fuel there is.

Many people will say different but only in my opinion we need ot keep the Elcectral College, it is part of the Constitution of the United Sates of America if it clearly staes stuff about the Electoal College in the Consistitution then that means you need to keep it in the sistem to help with all the dier need that the world has to offer for the Electoral College just dont get rid of it for no reason you need to have a really great suggestion to remove it out of the system.

All i am trying to say is that in my opinion if you care at all, the we need to keep the Electoral College alive dont just kick it out the system if it sates its name in the Constitution then it need to stay where its at dont delte it from the program just becauss of some stupid process you need a darn good reason to remove it not just because you feel like it thats not good enough you need to show emotion about how the Electoral College is in the Constisution

Please look at my reason in why to keep it in the sytem thank you so greatly much. Just take me up on my opinion i am usally right in cases like this i show great emotion in stuff like this all you need to do is look at the facts and you will see why i want the it to stay moving and not to be kicked out.

On one rainy night Luke was the watchman he went to tell the captain his hourly report. After he did he slid down a slippery ladder and landed on his backside. His heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small piece of metal stopped him from going overboard. He was happy to be alive but he could not work for a few days because he had cracked ribs.

He turned 18 on a trip to Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. When his draft board found out that he was on a cattle boat trip they told him to keep doing trips. Lukes most fun times where on the way back from somewhere. Because they had dropped off all of the animals so they could play in the huge place where they had been.

fe95ebd,"Cars are an important part of American Culture, but a superpower country using them has big consequences.  Pollution is getting worse and worse, and greenhouse gases are heating up our world. There are a few advantages to limiting car usage: safety is improved, and less pollution.

Paris recently enforced a tentative law that banned driving so as to clear the air of pollution. Warm days and cold nights were trapping the car emissions (Source 2). In the other side of the world, America's car selling stats are decresing. This could mean that cars will be used less and less in the U.S., which would definitely benefit smoggy places like L.A. and New York (Source 4).

Fun fact: automobile accidents are the leading cause of desth for teenage Americans.

Now, if we were to remove that, then there would be no deaths. Thus, safety is improved. Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford motor Company, found that ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time... and improve safety"". (Source 4) Ford and Mercedes are already calling themselves ""mobility"" companies with a wider product range.

The world would be so much happier with less deaths and breathable air, so cars should be limited. Days where driving is not allowed would be a great idea for America, like in Bogota, Columbia. The capital city of Bogota was devoid of traffic jams and violators who used cars faced 25 dolllar fines (Source 3). The goal was to promote smog reduction and safety. America should follow this example and try to set one for other countries, because planet Earth doesn't have much time left and humans need to all they can before they become extinct.    ",3

The face on Mars couldn't be created by aliens because we would've had contact with aliens a long time ago.Scientist figured it could've been the formation of mesa because Mars has no planet life nor water life for anything to live on it.With the the recent pictures studies has shown that there was no alien marking on the face to show that aliens are on Mars.

The face on Mars had the resemblance of a human head formed by illusion showing the mouth,nose, and eyes. After showing the world one picture they wanted to see an up close picture they later toke another picture revealing it as a natural land form which there was no alien monument after all.

It was stated in the article by an person that the land form"" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says the man by the name of Gavin. ""That's a lava dome that the fotm of an isolayed mese about the same height as th Face On Mars.

In conclusion, I believe that the face on mars is in all actuallity just a land formation because since discovering the face there has been no more reappearences of any other momuments. There has been no contact with alien life",3
fe534a5,"Making computers understand human emotions and feelings, sounds like a great thing to have personally I thinnk that it could be. Having a computer or your phone basically know you and what you like can really make things easier when it comes to looking for things, shopping online and like in the article school work and understanding lessions. This is a resouce that is very valuable to all students in the classroom, I feel that it is useful because like in the reading it states "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Meaning that the computer will automatically change its way of teaching to find way that is fit for you, something like this in schools could completely change the way of school all together, and a great way for easy teaching. Now some might think other wise because of alot of problems that could possibly go wrong with it such as the cost of that software, If the software makes any mistakes, and weather or not the software would work for every student I also can see kids becoming lazy being a big problem too. why I still feel that this is a great idea and should actually be in school I also think for the fight of it that the parent should have to choose weather they would want there kids to experiment with it. Overall this software should be out there for every child to use if they so please.",3

This technology could have some amazing applications in the real world, like to suit web page ads to someones liking, to make computer-animated faces more expressive, and to monitor students emotion in the classroom. FACS should be used to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom.

FACS should be used to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom. One reason FACS should be used in classrooms is because it can monitor if the students are becoming confused or bored. The article says this here, ""A classroom computor could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This is valuable information for the teachers, because it can help them make lesson plans that are liked by and are more efficient for their students. Another reason FACS should be used in the classroom, is because it could adapt the lesson based on the emotions of the student. The article says this here, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This is important because it can modify the lesson plan to help the student directly, when they need it, even if they are not wanting to seek help.

FACS should be used to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom because it can monitor if the students are becoming confused or bored, and adapt the lesson based on the emotions of the student. This could be one much needed, huge change in the educational system. All in all, FACS is a great piece of technology that could help brighten up the future the same way the lightbulb did.",3
7fe2d12,"To the state and the state's country, the election of our president must be seen carefully and wisely. As the citizens of the state, people must realize that choosing someone to take control of orders and regulations and the way the country evolves, is a process that needs to be thought of and taken fairly. The president is to serve the people of his country well with responisbilities that can vary to meet the needs of the country,but the electoral college seems to become more and more unfair to those who vote. It must be changed to meet the needs of giving a responisble president, a more trustworthy election and the votes cast must be directly towards him rather than the electors. In other words, the Electoral College must be changed to become more fair towards the citizens.

The United States Of America, is of course a massive country with large variations of different needs. All over, there are people who vary in opinions, beliefs and lifestyle which can cause the Election of the president to become an important subject matter. To meet the needs of so many people, instead the Electoral college must not choose a president that takes up space, but instead have a right mind to be responisble in taking charge of the country and the people.

There are many reasons why a responsible president must be choose. Things like creating rules to attend the needs of all citizens and create equality amongst them, to keeping harm from out of reach, the Electoral College should become much more wiser in choosing the right ruler to take control. In the article

What Is The Electoral College by the office of the Federal Register, it states that the election process is held every four years along with the after election prepared by the govenor titled ""Certificate Of Ascertainment"" which sums the canadidates and electors as well as the winning canadidate. It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text

In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.

The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it. With many systems such as ""Winner-Take -All"" due to states titled as the ""Swing States,"" it can be an untrustworthy election fo rmany voters around the country. The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.

There is very little equality when it comes to elections especially, when the states are giving an unreliable system to choose for them. States that are considered ""Toss Ups"" are selfishly awarded the system named ""Winner-Takes-All"" due to how they apparently pay closer attention to the campaign. In the article

What Is The Electotal College by the office of the Federal Register, the method is first introduced in paragraph 7. Stating that the purpose of the ""Winner-Take-All"" system is not only,but to award all electors to the winning canadidate. It is said to be unrelaible and untrustworthy due to it's focus on states that appear t have more attention towards the election. On a more basic level, some states such as Rhode Island and South Carolina had not even witness the campaign and even leaving a few voters to have no say. Going back to the misunderstanding of the election of Romney,the country wittnessed an iresponsible canadidate that had ran for president. With the unreliable ridiculous system ""Winner-Take-All"" some states may or may not have even experienced how Romney had acted and his intentions towards the elections and the campiagn. With very little knowledge of the presidential canadidate and with limitations of voting and campaign ads, there is very little trust given towards the election process especially with more than a few states that are not being taken very seriously, with very little say. If the Electorial College could give off more information and more become more reliable towards all states, the process would be less sinister and more apreciated.

There are many more other factors in which the Electorial College must be changed to meet the appropriate dilemas and needs of the voters and their intentions towards the campaign. On the other hand, it has not changed at all only to stay unfair towards the entire country and possibly cause a catasrophe.

Let us say, there have been many incidents where elections have been on the edge of a major dilema. Wondering why a straight up orderly process can go to the point of a catasrophe, can all be easily explained as unfair.

All can be simplified in the article

Why Even The Best-Laid Defesnes of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, states back to the disater factor of the election of John F.Kennedy. It states back to the 1960's where faithless electors had pushed aside the votes and sayings of Louisiana had decided to vote for whomever they had wanted. It had caused a problem of course since the votes where not even of the people, but of the selfish sick minds of the electors who toke the process into their own hands. In the same paragraph it staes back to when the state of Hawaii had sent in two slates of electors to congress. With the unreliable actions of Richard Nixion,  had validated his opponent's electors of course to win over the campaign. once again another issue arises in the article

Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of Choosing The President, it agrees with the unfairness of the electorals by giving the example of how the Electorial College had turned off the potential voters due to the knowledge that their votes will be uncared for. In paragraph 23, it states that in the state of Texas, it was known that the votes would have know effect of the campaign what so ever. It aslo had staes that voters in politcal elections have no care rather than to express the political refrence than what the peole think or decide. This sums up that the process is unfair to many of the states voters and must be changed to become more open and share the equality with those who are losing thier trust.

In conclusion, the Electorial College mut be changed to meet the need of those who agree that is it irresponisble when givng a repsonisble president, a more trustworhty election and an unfair process. Yet this can all be fixed simply by changing the ways it is run and to give more freedom for the people.    ",6
e663d85,"DEAR

state senator i am writing this letter to argue in favor of keeping the electoral college and changing to election by polulor vote for the president of the united states. I beleve that we should keep it because peolpe and citizens have the right to vote for who they think would be a good leader for ower counrty.

I think that we should keep it like this because if we dont have enugh peolple to vote there may be a 100% that there will be a tie. Like in 1976 there was a tie if a mere 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted the other way there wouldnt have been a tie. I do know that under the electoral college system, voters vote for the president ,but for a slate of electors ,who in turn elect the president. I also know that the peolpe who pick the electors in the firs place depend on the state.

In conclution , i would like to make this argue because i think that we should be the ones that get the chance to vote for some one that i think we enough trust in please i hope that you understand the reason to why i am arguing in favor of keeping the electoral college and changing to election by populor vote for the president of the united states . thank you very much for receving my letter have a good day sincearly:

It wouldn't be easy but it would be survivable for humans. NASA wants to hover above Venos so it wouldn't be that dangerous going on the ground but that means they will be 30 miles above it. They can't reall get samples of rocks, gas, or anything because of how far away they are from planet Venus.

97d2f6b,"In the articles ""making lisa Smile,"" The author describe how new technology called the Facial Action Coding System can indetify Human emtions. people should not creat a System that can indentify people emtion because it's destroy people privicy.

To creat a Machine that can identify their emtion and action can be danger. because it's like taking their privicy away, also people would not feel said because they machine can indentify their emtion and their action. I don't think it's a effective thing to creat because many people will felt that their bein watch. to creat a Machine that can indentify people emtion and action is like taking their freedom form them. Also people can take advantage of this and invade other people privice.

This system can invade people privice and they won't fet safe. as it's show in the articles using video can track theri facial movemets in real face or in the painted face. Also it can identify their weight. Although this is a great invition thing for human It's still not efficted. because to able to figure people emotion and action it's not our problem. because it's like when your sibling go through your stuff that is privice. to able to figur out people privice can also destroy realtionship, because everbody has dark secerty.

In now day technology is develope more and more, somtime they can be usefull. Most of they time they can invade people privice and realtionship. It's not neccery to identiy people emtion because it's could be a private, or famiy problem.

to identify privice it's taking their right and freedom also people might not felt safe because they know bein spy. through out the invition this facial Action Coding is not most efficted invition. because they are usefull but in the other hand it's ruind people privice.

Although this Facial Action Coding system might be usefull for some people. I still don't think it's exclussice invition because this invition can destroy or take away people freedom. most people might not felt safe by their surrounding because they are bein watch. This Facial Action Coding System invition should not be well reconzied because it's can intamated other people relationship like family problem also it can deterimed their facial expressions, and can also reveal their emtion; Most people might felt that they are taking their privice and freedom form them.",2
09f2c09,I think that this would be valuable because this Facial Action Coding System really work because in the text it stated that they found out what was Mona Lisa moods. And they figured it out so if they put the computers in a classroom for kids they will find out if they need help or not. Another reason why i think that this computer is valuable is because it can help out the kids and to see if they need help and to also see what they are struggling with so they can fix the problems that the kids are having. Another reason why i think that the computers coding system is valuable to the classroom is because if they feel sad or anything going on at home or somewhere the computer can tell what is they mood and why they have this mood. I also think that this coding system would be good for a classroom because it can help teachers and what i mean is that if the student is struggling and the teacher dont know why the student is struggling but the coding system do the system can tell the teacher what she need to do to help the student understand i really think this would be good for school all over the world the world need this new technology and it need to help us get through school. This concludes my reason on why i think that the technology to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom are valuable.,2
8e5ed84,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author claims that Venus is a worthy planet for us to examine more closely. Venus is unihabitable and its impossible, with the technology we have today, for a human to step foot on venus. So why does the author beleive its a good idea to send humans to study this dangerous planet?

I beleive the author supports his idea that studying Venus would be a good idea very well. Although Venus is uninhabitable and dangerous for humans the author shares many solid facts that throughly support his claim. For example the author states in paragraph 4 that ""it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system."" The author also shares that Venus may have once supported forms of life. I beleive these two facts alone could spark interest in the reader and get him/her to want to know more about whats on Venus. In paragraph 4 the author also states that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit. I beleive this fact supports the authors claim very well. Not only does the author provide facts that sparks the readers interests he also provides logical ways and evidence of how scientists can get humans to Venus. In paragraph 5 the author says ""NASAs possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"" meaning NASA might be able to create a vehicle that can float above all the dangers of Venus.

Despite the dangers and extreme conditions of venus the author still supports his claim with logical facts and resonable ideas. I beleive he supports his claim very well. ",3
3f0b178,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes the new facial recognision technology called the Facial Action Coding System(FACS). This system claims to read emotion expressions. I think that the FACS could help sience in understanding the emotions and muscle relationship and think it is a valuble thing in classrooms.

Some possitive thing about the new technology are adaptation and improvment. With this new technology we can use it to adapt different things like ads and school lessons. Ads can sometimes completely take out the interest on the viewers for the video and can be sometimes unpridictable. This has happend numerous times in classrooms when a teacher wants to show a documentary that is all ready slighty borring and an ad showing an exciting new superheroes movie comes up So now you have the entire class talking about it and not paying any atention to the documentary about Charles Darwin and what he did. Having these distracting ads adapt to what the audience is feeling could help bring down the amount of times this happens. The FACS could also help in computer lesson planing. If the FACS would be installed in a computer the computer would be able to realise that a student is no longer paying attencion becouse of boredom. So system can then improve what the lesson has by chnging the order around to give the student a more personalised lesson thus having the student learn easier.

There are some bad feedback as well. If the FACS system succeds in improving the academic scores of the students the school administration might deside that the teacher are no longer needed to teach the student, the students could just study in there cmputers. Another way the FACS could not be so good is that it is likely to be very expencive and there is ways a possibility it can malfunction and give unwanted changes in lessons and other sections in which it would be used.

In conclusion I think that the FACS could be of great help in the world if it could be 100% reliable. This system could benifit the every day use if used corectly and I think that the FACS could help sience in understanding the emotions and muscle relationship. I think it is a valuble thing in classrooms. ",3
7f5de29,"The future is coming. In this modern age, we have personal assistants on our phones, holographic keyboards, and even 3D TVs. It's not that far fetched that soon we could also have self-driving cars as well. Self-driving cars are quickly becoming a reality, but they first should be tested so no hazardous glitches remain.

Recently there have been multiple breakthroughs that have advanced progress on making an actual self-driving car. One such advances was the more advanced sensors that are now put on cars. Now, these sensor help alert drivers to where a possibly dangerous situation is, but in the future they could be used as the ""eyes"" for the car. No car would be able to drive on it's own without being able to sense which direction it's going. As well there have been multiple breakthroughs with computer systems, which would give the car the know-how in order to drive on it's own. Lastly, thanks to satellite imaging, almost the entire world has been mapped out. This, added along with everything else, could really help realize the future of the self-driving car.

Now even though this idea sounds fantastic, it's not without flaws. Sometimes computers will suffer errors in their programming. Most of the time, this isn't too important, but if it happened to a self-driving car with someone in it, the results could be disasterous. The cars would need to be heavily tested to get rid of as many of these errors as possible. As well, there would also have to be a new set of laws that pretain to self-driving cars. One such law would be if a car crashed, who would be responsible, the passenger or the manufacturer?

Self-driving cars are quickly becoming a reality, but first they need to be tested to make sure they don't have any hazardous glitches. In this modern age, we have personal assistants on our phones, holographic keyboards, and even 3D TVs. It's not much of a stretch of the imagination to think that self-driving cars could arrive soon. The future is definitely coming.",3
3b06e15,"Cars have been around for a while now and have been advancing and changing each year as time has gone on. People have depended on cars to get them from their job, school, practice for a team and even to just get them to a friends house. In the earlier days such as the 1950's to the 1980's most cars were gorgeous works of art and had style and class and each new model looked significantly different from the last. Alot more people now a days preferred those cars over the ones we have now and not just adult men from age 40 or above but also young teens such as myself simply because they are pretty and most of the engines have a much nicer sound to them. As silly as that sounds it's the truth and basically the only reason, but the problem is that those cars burn gas like it's going out of style, they are very heavy compared to modern day cars because most of them were made out of steel, they weren't aerodynamic and besides the fact that they caused a good amount of pollution, they were also very unsafe if you were to get in a car crash.

From then until now we've been advancing cars by making them aerodynamic, lighter weight, less gas to power them and they are also much safer. Since cars have been pretty much a constant thing and being bought more and more they are starting to become a problem now. The problem is that cars have been polluting the world for a constant and long rate of time and it needs to be slowed down so that the air we breathe can start to become more pure and fresh again. I'm not saying that it was perfect before cars came along either because it wasn't but it was a heck of alot better then than now. Now cars play a big part in not only pollution but also global warming which needs to stop.

A world without cars is impossible, there will always be cars around. Instead a world with a limited amount of car usage, now that's possible. I know I love cars, not all of them of course, like i'm no fan of a hybrid but sports cars and muscle cars catch my eye and I love hearing the roar of a powerful engine and seeing how it all is perfectly pieced together under the hood. I also love the world I live in though and I wouldn't want to pollute it anymore then it already has been but I would never want the world I love to be without the cars that I love either. That's why i'd be willing to stop constantly using cars for transportation and find another way to get to where I need to go.

Not only would the world be better without us constantly using cars but so would we. We wouldn't have to worry about reckless drivers and making sure we don't forget to put our seat belt on. Fathers and Mothers wouldn't have to cry at their sons or daughters funeral bacause they were in an accident. The amount of teen deaths by car crashes from driving under the influence would reduce because we wouldn't be driving nearly as much. Even people with COPD or Aesthma would be better off because they'd be breathing cleaner more crisp air rather than what they have to breathe now.

I would never want a world without cars because I love cars and I even want to make a career out of my love for them and become an Automotive Technician/Mechanic. I still want what's best for the world I live in though and if that means less driving and more walking, jogging or biking then i'm okay with that. People who say they feel the same way should also take action rather than just saying it would be better they should try to make it better. I will try my best to find other ways of transportation rather than driving and I hope others will too. Those are some of the advantages I can think of about limiting car usage and i'm more than sure there are one hundred more advantages to limiting the usage of cars but that's the best I could think of so I hope I had some good points.                    ",3
4a84ca9,"I am against the developement of ""Driverless Cars."" Although a driverless car may sound cool, or may change the world someday, there are some negatives that go along with the production of the car. Driverless cars would be an expensive thing to prouduce. It would cause human driveres to not pay attention as much as they need to, and traffic laws would need a lot of updating.

The car would not be completely driverless, in the text it reads ""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over..."" With that being said, a driverless car wouldn't be the correct name for it. Another reason the production of these cars would not be a great idea, is the money. For the car to respond to the things it needs it would require massive upgrades to existing roads, which is not practical. Along with the road needing upgrades, the car would too. The car would need a whole lot of sensors, in the text it states, ""The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" As if the human body is the best driver in the world, I feel as putting most of the control in the car would not be a great idea. To get cars up to the proper state they need to be would cost a lot of money.

In a driverless car the ""driver"" would still need to be alert when ""driving the car."" The thought of having a driverless car would make people think they can text, eat, play games, and drink while driving. Yes you say, ""While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver,"" how reliable would those cameras be, they could easily go out, break, or mess with other signals.

The law is what is stopping these cars from being out on the road. Traffic laws are written in the assumption that a human driver has control at all times, not when there is an accident, construction, or busy traffic. Traffic laws can change frequently, but if these driverless cars were to become a thing, traffic laws would need changed abudantly. New laws would need to be set in place for liability in the case of an accident. How would you solve that? Who is at fault? The driver has control when it needs to, but the car is doing most of the work. The statement about the displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over, what if the driver can't get the displays to turn off.

In conclusion, the production of ""Driverless Cars"" should not continue. It will cost a whole lot of money to get existing roads up to pass an inspection. Along with the fact that the human behind the wheel in case need be could fall asleep, drinking, or texting and not paying attention could cause more accidents then needed. And finally take into matter all the changes traffic laws would have to make or change. It would be better to let humans driver themselves to where they need to be instead of some computer genorated car get me to my destination.",4
162bdec,"Did you know that there are car-free cities? In the German suburbs, life goes on without cars and vehicles to use as transportataion. In the outskirts of Freiburg, a lot of things that envolve car use are forbidden. Driving in Paris is also banned because of smog. In Bogoto, Columbia, they decided to spead the Day Without Cars to local countries.

Near the French and Swiss borders, on the outskirts of Freiburg, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in the new district. On Vauban's streets, it is almost a car-free area. The only vehicle on the streets is the tram that travels to downtown Freiburg and few streets on one edge on the community. It's not like the whole idea of cars are forbidden. People are allowed to own cars but, there are only two places to park. ""They are allowed to park in large garages at the end of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home"", paragraph 2 states.

Because of the air pollution, Paris set up a partial driving ban to clear the air. On Monday, drivers with a even-numbered license plate have to leave their cars at home or pay a 22-euro fine, which is ($31). Close to 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded, due to the reaction of the fine. The good thing about it is, after the change was put into action, congestion went down 60% in the capital of France after 5 days of intensifying the smog. The idea worked perfectly fine and ended up making a great change in France and helped the environment.

During a car-free day in Bogota, Columbia, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, and took buses to work. The purpose of this action was to control pollution and avoid traffic jams. The Day Without Cars was so effective that, it began spreading to other countires. The turnout was large, people didn't even care about the weather. There were just a bunch of people working together for a good cause. The outcome took away a lot of stress and also reduced air pollution in Columbia.

Although, cars are used very often and are a useful form of transportation, they are also very hamful. Taking a break from driving isn't a bad idea. Maybe the people in Florida should consider taking action and having our own care-free day. It wouldn't hurt! If anything, i'll help!    ",2

These are just a few of the places that we go to so the horses can get where they need to be. We will go way across the world just to deliver horses.

Luke had no friends when he came other than the friend that asked him to go with him to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Luke made many new friends on the boat. He made 9 (nine) trips all together from that whole career that he had with that job. He had fun and learned new things about boats and horses.

He thought it was going to be a chance of a life time but he changed his mind it being completely amazing better than what he thought it would be for someone like him. His journeys were amazing and he loved it and his family was very proud of him and his friend. He said he is grateful for the opportunity. He also said it made him more aware of people of other countries and there needs. The awareness stayed with him and it lead his family to host many of international students and exchange visiters and students for many years.

This is Lukes story and this is why you should join. ",3

It helps you choose your state's electors when you vote for president because you are actullay voting for your candidates electors. Under the system of electoral college voters vote not for presdint ,but for a slate of electors instead. It could help us undersatnd voting for our electors if you keep electoral voting. Even though some say that this was the 2000 fisaco was the biggest election crisis in a century. The system could of had worse. I think it helps with voting more than anything else instead of the online voting for the slate electors.

Some also so it should be abloished and that it's unfair and very irrantional, it has helped more than do any damage to any other type of voting like that tabs we once used to vote for everything. We should keep it because of its certanity of outcome because it helps when there is a tie on voting. ""Swing States"" are anthor reason because of the winner takes all method we sawin 2012's election to focus their campaign efforts on the  toss up states ,it help us out because at the end of paragraph 20 it says the most thoughful voters should be the ones to decide the election with electoral college.  It does also big states electoral college restores some of the weigth in the political balance that large states lose by virtue.

It does also help with run-off elections it helps avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. It says that it may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hopes of carrrying their state. Those are my reasons why you shouldn't  get rid of electoral voting hopfully you will condsier it.            ",3

It mentions in paragraph 6 that they intend to make cars more and more independant,and that sensors will be the cars main feature to see. this again can be hazardous if those sensors are disrupted or hacked. in pargraph 7 it mentions that the car can steer, accelerate, and brake on its own,a car doing that at the wrong moment can cause a major crash or serious injury to the driver,and flashing lights on the windshields can be distracting if the car is in manual use.

Lawmakers know safety is best achieved with an alert driver,so traffic laws have made smart cars illegal even to test computer-driven cars in California, Nevada, and the District of Columbia.

Driverless cars should not be used because they are vulnerable to hacking, glitching, and disruption and can be a road hazzard in any situation, so you should not support automated cars and further develop driver dependant cars.",2
935806c,"Electoral votes is what we need but some disagree . Choosing our president is more complicated than people think it is . One thing that voters do not know when electing presidents is that their vote might not matter as much as they think due to the electoral college . Who is to say electoral votes or better than popular votes ?

To cemmence with , electoral votes usually doesn't change anything , if a candidate has the most popular votes it is more likely that electoral votes won't change anything . Although electoral votes did change the race during the 2000 election . Gore had more popular votes against Bush , yet Bush had more electoral votes . That situation had not happened since the election of 1888 . In the past 200 years , only twice has electoral votes changed the peoples mind . Some still disagree because this means that the people aren't voting for a president , thy are voting for a slate of electors .

Furthermore , electoral votes are basically a summary of the states vote . People vote for a slate of electors to represent their state in the election . Voters will vote for a representative to choose who becomes president on electoral votes . Sometimes voters get confused and choose the wrong candidate which is one of the reasons why people think the electoral college should be terminated .

In conclusion , their have always been arguements about the electoral college , even past presidents were against it . Some say it's a good idea because it rarely affects the outcome but some argue that it doesn't let the people choose who they think should be president which violates one of the rights that citizens were granted .

e8c0a8e,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggest that Venus is worhty of being studied despite the dangers that it presents. Us humans have landed on the Moon and sent and leanded rovers on Mars why not try and land a rover on Venus. The author does a good job of supporting his/her claim that we should go to and study Venus more, by talking about how it may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, sending blimp-like vehicles to hover above the surface, and testing that NASA has done.

Venus may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In the article the author states ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" the author says in paragraph 4 is ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" the authors means that since Venus has all of these terrains that are similar to Earth that it may have had liquid water on the surface and the right temperatures to support life.

In the next paragrphs the author talks about imagining sending a blimp-like vehicle to venus to hover around 30 miles above the surface like how our jet planes fly at a higher altitude to avoid flying in storms. towards the end of paragraph 5 it states that the ""temperautres would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" This shows that if we use the right materials we could fly the blimp-like aircraft and study how the air pressure is and the exact degrees the atmosphere would be.

Lastly, the author explains on how the testing that NASA has done. In the text the author says ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus... some simplified electronicsmade of silicon carbide have been tested.. simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" this shows that the author is getting information from a reliable source (NASA). The author also dives deeper and talks about how another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers and that they can resist physical conditions better than modern computers.

In conlusion, the author did a great job saying that Venus is worthy of studying even though the dangers that it presents to us.

he/her supported their idea well with reasons like, how Venus may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system saying that earlier in Venus's lifetime that it was probably covered in water and supported various lifeforms. Another reason was to imagine sending a blimp-like spacecraft to hover 30 miles above the surface o Venus, and , Lastly the test that NASA has been doing to spacecrafts to withstand Venus's surface for at least three weeks. This are good reasons to back up the claim that the author has made.   ",4
f60d499,"Are driverless cars a good or bad thing? In my opinion driverless cars can be a bad thing. These next few paragraphs will explain why I think this and all the cons of the cars.

If driverless cars ever do become a pratical thing one big problem we would have to worry about is the GPS or the LIDAR malfunctioning and the car doesn't know whats going on around it. If something like that did happen and the person in the car was not paying attention the car could seriosly indjure some one or it could total itself. A lot of these cars features rely on the fact that if something goes wrong then person behind the wheel is ready to take over but if some thing does go wrong and the the person is sleeping they could swerve into a semi-truck or a building. One of the biggest problems of this car is the fact that tech can stop working and cause accidents.

Another con of these cars is the fact that they could get hacked by other people. Recently in 2015 two people (with permission) hacked a car that was not even driverless they could control speed,steering,door lockes,brakes,and so on. Imagine what could happen if criminals hacked into these cars they could potentialy kill lots of people by making the cars crash into buildings,cars,and other things. Another problem is human error.

What if something does go wrong and the person is not ready to take over? I have touched on this a bit already but I'm going into a little more detail. Much like normal cars the driver has to be awake behind the wheel ,in the case of driverless cars, just in case they need to take over the wheel of the car. If someone is on a long drive and decide to let the car drive itself but as they are sleeping the cars malfunctions and the driver does not know they need to take over the car and the person could end up in in a ditch or end up crashing into another car or even worse a semi-truck. After these reasons and some others I think that these cars can be a bad thing on the road but only time can tell if thats the case.

Are driverless cars a bad thing? In my opinion yes they can be after reading the artical and looking at the facts i conclude that these cars could be a hazerd on the road.           ",3
2019908,"""What is the

Electoral college?

In the history, talk electoral college. The electoral college consists of the selection of the eletors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the couting of the electoral votes by congress.

also, the electoral cogelle consists of 538 electors. a majority of 570 electoral votes is requiered to elect the president.

According with the test, i agree because all the candidates generally hace responsabilities . so, they need to demostrate to the people that them can have good ideas for the state. then the people need to have a vote for the best candidate for that can pass to be the new president of the state. each candidate have many obligations with the state the obligation president is better the state. one ""evidence is each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors""

in conclusion, i think that is good be president of a state but a president have many obligations that to accomplish.     ",1

My first reason why i support the idea is that it would be a great way to save you time and allow you also accomplish more tasks in your day. For instense you could do paper work, phone calls, homework and many other tasks. But i would only support this idea if it was safe and would not brsomething to complicated to handle if there were to be a accident. A great exaple is in paragragh 9 when it says ""if technology fails and someone is injured , who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer"". This is what probaly would make msot of the laws think more in depth and question the idea more.

The next reason i would support this idea is it would be a very extriodinary to see on daily basis when going to work or school. A example would be for this would be in paragraph two when it ways ""Television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could dirve themselves"". Which to date i think people are still waiting to see if this idea were to come true.

My final reason would be it is a fun thing to ahve and drive. A example of this is in paragraph eight when the BMW project manager driver says ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way"". Like everything it would get old eventually but also there would

most likely be new add-ons to the idea or newer self driving cars coming out yearly.

In conclusion i would agree to have to this idea be made possible worldwide. Like i said it would be a great way to save time, a fun car to have, and lastly only if it would be safe. All in all i think many people would like to see this idea come to live.",3
9576200,"The negative things about driverless cars: onr thing about drivless cars is that they can drive them self during construction work. They also take alot of parts to make them. such as sensors these sensors make that the car realize what it's finn

to

run in and is can also let the driver know to. It can let the driver know by alerting the drive to stop when the car is to close to something

and when to turn its wheels. even tho that smart cars can read positive and negative polarity as messages in binary code these smart roads system still require massive upgrades to existing road.

Now for the positive and negative things about driverless cars: some positive things are that the drive most of the time on their own, they are way less polutated, they also are not truly driverless, drove over a million miles without crashing, and ect.

Okay now lets talk about the positive and negatives. These driverless cars are very non-poluting because, they use half the fuel of a modern day taxi and they are far more flexibil than a bus.They might not be driverless all the the time but for the mostn of the time they can proceed to watch the driver while the driver watches the road.Not only do these car drive themselves they have drover a million miles without any car crashes nor accidents. some states limited these cars but they only did so until they can be proven safe. This because they still need to make laws in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. if the technology fails in these cars and some outside and side gets hurt, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer.

But still automakers are still working on the assumption that these problems would be resolved. In 2016 telsa projected that a car would be able to drive on autopilot 90 percent of the time. But still i think that we should give the cars a chance to save the fuel in these cars and to have a good ecomony. I hope that by the end of 2020 that Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan will develope these cars to.    ",4

To begin with in some countrys or states or anywhere in the united states some counrtys ban from alot of things when you drive. for example Paris bans driving due to smog,also if leave you car in the way of the road you fine anywhere you go in life, so you have to think before drive or do other things while your driving. Citizens use diesel fuel when they drive, some people have to,for example france they have tax policy on diesel over gasoline ,but the most percent that citizens use is diesel engines. citizens changes of different usage of things between gas and companies, but they have avantages for them and to make the better so it can be used.

Their is  place called Bogota and there they have a car free day, but has beed the third year they have been banned with buses and taxis permitted for a day without a car. to begin with alot of places have banned without cars but some have not, for example to banned without a car would not be good because if have a car and cant drive it because the city is banned or the country is banned from then the bus abnd taxi and everything else is banned then your permmtted withour a car to drive,ride. people come Bogota come to see how enthusiastic they have been ,now they improvement without cars,which sounds good becasuse the mayor improving something new for them or just changing things around. now new things are starting to come in sidewalks are being replaced,they have cut traffic, new restaurants,so with everything improving then maybe cars wont banned no more restriced things maybe everything might be limting to what the mayor is saying.

Now that president Obama has been seeing whats been going on about the banning of the cars and no limiting usage, things are now starting even more with the president in the advantage,now the question is that their asking is ''has America passed peak driving"" to me on ther hand it has, becasue all the commtions between things being banned and they see the usage of things, but now everything is starting to change. now people are starting to get what is their back now the ownership of their house and their payments of everything is going down. to conclude, all of the study from last year about the driving of young people has decreased by so much percent . now since everything is back to normal then things don't have to be bannned alot anymore so if they can keep the percentage down then evrything is good, if it does go down they can get usage, now they can save time improve their life they are living.                             ",2

Things such as self driving automobiles. These wonders of technological beauty have the abilty to control and operate themselves without a driver. This is a truly marvelous feat that shows how far we as a society have come however this driverless cars should be seen as a mere fun idea. Driverless cars should not be used in our society as the will cause far to many proplems just so we can be lazy behind the wheel.

Making a driverless car is no simple feat it requires numours things to operate effectivly. One item that these cars require are senors and lots of them. Senors are used so that way the car can tell what is going on in

traffic. However what happens if one of these systems fail at one point on the road. That right a tragic accident will occur that could lead to the loss of lifes for no reason just because a stupid glitch occured.The senors may be tested to make sure they dont malfuntion, but so is everything in this era and yet gliches and mistakes still happen in all of our everyday technology.Our phones which are simple compared to a driverless car still have proplems all the time, and they have been tested and improved upon for far longer.

These driverless cars arent even truly driverless. Humans are still required to be behind the wheel to handle certain situations such as construction or road blocks.So whats the point of having one of these cars if at any point you can be thrust onto the wheel unprepared for what might be on the road at that given point.This fact truly ruins the convience of owning one of these cars as they fail to do their key function which is to operate on their own. These cars are also still only considered safe at 25mph which drastically reduces their overall usefullness to the consumer if they need to go anywhere at a reasonable pace.

Driverless cars also are not practical in todays time. Imagne how many new types of tech stores would have to be opened to keep the senors on these cars running properley. How many times a year would someone have to get these senors checked? More importantly how much would it cost to fix one of these cars? The awswer is that we dont no as these cars are untried and untested. These Cars also couldnt fit into our soceity where barley anybody will have the money to afford to keep one of these new cars.

Simply put driverless cars are intesting and facinating to watch. They are true marvels of the 21st century and show how far as a civilazation we have come.

Limiting car usage has so many advantages that we cant see for ourselves such as citizens getting more exercise in Vauban, Germany. Less accidents and traffic jams occuring in the major cities and highways in our world, and there are less deaths that happen in our world today by deadly crashes for poor driving.

Based on source 1 it explains ''how people get better exercise with banning car usage''. Imagine living a healthy life by walking everywhere you go you would be so much more healthier with your lifestyle and how much you change dramatically by folowing the rules unless you want to get a very expensive ticket from the local police officers. I would recommend you to take this opportunity because it's only going to benefit you and everyone else if you tell them the same information.

Based on source 3 in Bogota, Columbia it explains to us ''how there is less accidents and traffic jams that are occuring everyday due to the limited car usage based on number 20 in source 3''. But they still offer bus and taxi transportation for individuals that want to travel or go to work based on what they decide to do. So imagine a world without rarely any accidents that get our citizens killed just for lack of use from driving cars.

Based on all the sources ''it also tells us that less people have death casualties ocuuring daily from car drivers that use it with no responsibility and no courage''. With less people dieing life would be so much better for everyone to hang out with there families and there friends or girlfriends and boyfriends. Limiting car usage can make this ocuur so much successfully by the bad ones to just take a bus or taxi instead of getting in the cars to just hurt someone by accident or on purposeby there lack or driving.

Altogether limiting car usage makes our world have so many advantages that we have never had before. Such as the less accidents, and traffic jams that drive people nuts. And having so less deaths our world has to face everyday from someone lacking there driving skills. Now lets get in those buses and taxis and forget about our cars please.        ",3

We should limit our car usage to a minimum to protect the earth.

First if we limit our car usage, the Earth would be a better place. Like in paragraph 5 it states that, cars are responsible 12% of greenhouse gas in Europe and about 50% in the U.S. In other words this means that car usage contribute to air pollution a lot. Also if we can limit our car usage this percent can decrease a lot and make the earth less polluted.

Paragraph 3 reads, ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Which shows that if you limit your car use, you may become less tense with cetian things and become les stressed out, which makes a happier you. Also, paragragh 24 reads, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution...."" this shows that if you can just can find another way someplace like a bike or a bus that it would be better for you because you wont be so stressed out and you can relax and enjoy yourself like never before.

d4a0406,"Why make driveless cars? Is this an easy way out for people who are lazy? I ask myself these questions because I think with driveless cars humans will become fairly lazy. If we have driveless cars in the future having to take a permit or a driving test wouldn't be nessasary at all. I believe it is ok to have updated technology in our cars to possibly prevent accidents, but I think cars should still be controlled by someone. First, we should always have an alert driver behind the wheel,secondly, we would have to completely change traffic laws all because of a automatic cars, thirdly, cars would be easier for people to access.

Although having to drive a car with no effort sounds nice, but it will cause a huge impact on someone if they weren't paying attention and got in a horrible accident. In today's society we have a hard time without texting and driving. It's like giving a car to a baby who can't let go of its favorite toy. If we drive with no alert of what its going on, how are we gonna know when its our turn to drive. Accidents occur everyday just think about how many more we would get with driveless cars. The excuse for every accident could be ""I didn't know they were coming.""

Our next battle would be how traffic laws would drastically change. If we have drivers riding around not being as attentive as we have to be now laws would be completely different. Traffic lights would probably have to altered to be more technology friendly. Not only do we have to adjust, but so does law enforcment. Officers may not even have to stay on people about traffic violations. Without the police enforcing traffic violations it would be harder for them to notice people out of the ordinary. Like people who drink while driving. If no one is there to catch things like that their could be way more accidents.

Lastly, cars would be easy for young teens to drive cars. Since kids are very well acustomed to technology we have an advantage on knowing how to work and generate the new technology updates in the car. Earning a permit would no longer be needed because people wouldn't have to do anything for their car. With the car driving for them kids could just ride along,which leaves the risk of kids who didn't have to learn the how to stay alert. They would be more likely to get in accidents.

In conclusion, I will say that having driveless cars in the futre would not help, but disable our society even more. Kids would be more likely to recieve are car at a younger age than sixteen. People will have to get aquanted with new found traffic laws that could cause several people pay cuts. Lastly, I believe all drivers should be alert while driving. With no ones eyes on the road we could be more prone to have more accidents. New technology sounds nice,but people would just get hurt in the long run.",4
04f8928,"In my opinion , driverless cars shouldn't be a thing . Why? ,because what if the car malfunctions and swerves off the road into oncoming traffic. Electronics and things tend to malfunction alot and Driverless Cars is risking the life of people .

Driverless cars are for the lazy people, they're for people who don't wanna drive they just want to sit back and let the car drive for them. If that was the case they wouldn't have gotten their license to drive. In the future licenses wouldn't be a thing if driverless cars are around , there's no need for one if the car just lets you sit there and watch it drive every where,that's just wasted time to get your permit then wait a few months and then get your license for driving.

Before putting any real driverless cars into the real world they should round alot of tests , because they should want everything perfect no messups or anything because that can be very dangerous if the cars system isn't programmed right or anything . That is a risk to lives of people who decide to buy them",2
4b8c90b,"In this essay Im going to be explainig about the advantage of limiting car usage. First of all a man says that when he had a car he was always tense. Now he says his more happier with out a car. Cras are good in some ways but bad in other ways because cars contaminate the air with the smoke. Their good because they take you places faster and more comftorble. But many European cities are not permiting cars, and they say is good for them. They live better now.""All of our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberge.

In the United States, the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduce"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. I think that the United States should take reducing cars in consideration, too see how it goes. After five-days of intensifying smog... The smog rivaled Beijing, China wich is know as one of the most polluted cities in the world. So imagen what it would do in the United States. In Bogota, Colombia a program that set to spread to the others countries million of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day. Leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third year that they been doing this. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. For the first time other colimbian cities joined the event. We should have a Car-Free day here in the United states to see how it goes.

American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Maybe these means people are getting over about the car fever. People should vote to have a car-free day. It would be good people would be less tens, they would get more excercise and pollution would dropp. This would be good for you and for me.    ",2
ede87e4,"If everybody limited car usage, the whole population would save a ton of money. Insead of having to pay for gas, we will be able to pay for more things to provide for ourseleves and our families. We would be able to buy more of what we want; clothes, shoes, food, drinks, housing, taxes. We would save so much money because we wouldnt have to pay for gas anymore.

We will be able to walk or bike to all of the stores, work-cites and recreation facilities. It will only take a couple of minutes to get where we would need to be. We wont have to use a highway or interstate to go to the mall or ball field. Also, we will be getting more exercise. By walking and bikinng, we arent sitting and being lazy. Instead, we will be healthy and active everyday.

If we cut car usage out, people wont have to worry about money. Nobody will be labeled as ""poor"" or ""homeless."" Everybody by then should have enough money to have a house, a job, food and money to pay the bills. Crime will then go down because nobody will have to rob or steal for foood, money, or posessions. Everybody will have enough money to get what they want, on top of the money they get from working.

Instead of spending money on cars, we can spend that on neccesities. We will be able to walk, bike or use the public transportation given to us. We would be better off without cars because there would be little to any deaths caused by automobiles. Nobody will have to be scared of dying or scared of not being able to make/have enough money.

41446e4,"To whom this may concern,

The ""winner takes all"" system we've been using doesn't work. Less power is essentially being given to the people, and, some are even being ignored.

In cases such as Al Gore's, the people said yes, and the College said no. And, voters didn't like this. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, after Al Gore lost the race, ""over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"", meaning, Mr. Senator, it's time for change. In addition, this system easily allows for a tie. In this event, the results of the race would be decided by the House of Representatives, which we all know would swiftly put in a vote for the Republican canidate. And, since the Senate has also been recently dominated by Republicans, they too would choose one of their own, resulting in two branches of the government dominated by one political party.

Moreover, with this faulty system, many people are being ignored. As you may recall (or not), ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.""(Source 2, Paragraph 13) [(Although not seeing the ads might not have been a bad thing. (I'm just kidding.)] Why is this important? Because the people need to see and meet their canidates, but due to the electoral collage, people are being ignored. If the majority of the votes are known to be going to one canidate or the other, they will most likely not be visited by either side, because whom that state's electoral votes are going to are essentially locked in. The only states that recieve any attention are the ""Swing states"" (Source 2, Paragraph 13) that are pretty equal on both sides and can be easily swayed to pick one canidate or the other.

The only evidence to refute my claim would be that ""Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation"" (Source 1, Paragraph 7), which actually might work; however, this would require all the states to change their policies, which we all know won't happen very easily.

So, in summary, Mr. Senator, the way things work is going to need to change, we are being ignored and elections are being thrown. If you don't help us change this, the power of electing the president is going to remain with our, faulty, college.

I hope you consider this,

6e3eec8,"The author explains to us how worthy it is to study Venus for example in the articel he claimes that Venus has so many features like earth for example like an ocean or a mountain he alos said there could even be some type of life form that could live there. There has been more and more people wanting to study this because of the fact that this one day might become another earth that we can live on and form some type of life on there but people have to test it out to see if we are able to live there for example to see if any animal life form can live there or even start bringing other to Venus for some testing. The big issue though is that the tempture gets really high like around 800 degrees for example it siads that ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volecanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightn skrikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" For example in paragraph 5 it saids "" The National Aeronautics and space administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. NASA's possible solutions to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Vesusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms , a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of there way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface , temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be plentiful,and radiation would notexceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable enough for humans.""

bf2c87b,"The author was talking about all off the crazy thing that venus has in common with planet earth, but it would be highly dangerous to go. When the author talks about all of the bad conditions that venus has its makes you really think how hard it would be to get to the hot lava planet. What the author is trying to get you to see is that venus has a lot of dangerous conditions, but that the scientists know how hard that would be.

The author starts off with putting details of venus in our head by saying things like, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"" and ""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"". By this the author is trying to tell you how hard it would be for man-kind to be in physical contact with venus. The author is putting physical details in our head about this planet.

After the author starts talking about that he states the question ""why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface""? The author ask this to us thinking about whats the point if there is nothing speaical its just a hot rock. Wrong, the author states how venus was just like earth it had it valleys it had its water it had everything earth has. It would be very good to know that if anything happen to earth we always have a back up planet to go to.

The last thing that the author was trying to do was talk about how The National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. When I read that it kinda got me excitied i was thinking we might get to see mars wow thats cool. The author states that ""imagines a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the Venusian landscape"".

In conclusion what the author is trying to get the reader to do would be make all of the reader think about how cool it would be to be able to go to a ""earth like planet"". How he uses the details and the things they learned from NASA kinda gets you exicited about what will come in the future. So the author was giving us all of these reasoning about how dangerous it would be but it woukd be very good to know.",3
9dab0d6,"There is different opions about technology used in class, some people may be agree and some people may be disagree. Sometime we dont understand how easy can be life if we lmprove our technology, in this case there is a program that reads emotional expressions, if we allow this technology into classrooms it can help use to figure out many problems, for example, when someone is sad, or it's really worry about something,or even when we distracted. Most of the times we stay quietbecause we scare of what other people will say, but sometimes it would be good to let others know so they can help us and prevent from bad things to occur.

It would be good to use this type of techonlogy in a classrrom because the teacher will notice when his class is gettting bored and is learning less, so the teacher can improve something to do better and make his student to pay attention and learn more. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Most of the times when a student is bored in class is because he does not like his class, and whyhe does not like his class? probably he dont understand well, and the student needs help, so if the teacher would have this technology they will know what is happening, and they can try to fix this problem, either making his class more interesting,explain more, staying more time, or working after school. The point of of this is to make students to focus and be able to learn well. After the students learn they will doing better in school, better grades, and later on they can have better future.

This new technology can help us in many ways because it can helps us to know if there is something wrong happening that maybe it needs to be changed, if we choose to use it we would increase our opportunies to do good. kids would have better education, and the better our education is the better our nation will be.

b7bf084,"Technology gets a lot of backlash, but in reality it is our friend. Technology empowers and teachus us. Without it, we wouldn't be as informed of the world as we are now. For this reason, advanced technology should continue to be used. Introducing the FACS technology in schools would be valuable because it would create a more beneficial enviornment for everyone: society and individuals alike.

Implementing the Facial Action Coding System into schools would be very valuable for society as a whole. The article states that the software provides the exact emotions of someone. For example, the machine might declare that someone is ""83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry."" (paragraph 1) Teens' actions related to their emotions are still fairly unknown, so having this information on adolescents in particular would help us be able to identify the root of the emotions later on. It's clear that FACS would seriously benefit science.

Perhaps the most important reason for going through with this technology is that people would be more honest with each other at school. Enabling teachers and students alike to see how others are feeling would create a distinct openness in the school. Students would no longer feel that they have to put on a ""happy face,"" (as the article mentions in paragraph 9) when they're sad. There would be no point for this deception, since FACS would see right through it. People who felt sad could be comforted by others. Students would be more happy than they are now, at the end of a long school day. Having the FACS technology in schools would create an enviornment of honesty and happiness.

It's true that having a machine see right through you would take some getting used to. But this unsettling feeling is overcome by the fact that this technology benefits science and our enviornments in a huge way. It makes us into a better people, so the question is, why would we not go through with it? ",4

14c4255,"How would you feel if their was a computer watching you as do your work? Do you think that would be weird and maybe even uncomfortable? Well, that is what would be happening if their were computers that read your expressions. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" Dr. Huang and Dr Eckman have developed a system that does so. The use of this technoogly to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.

First of all, the article states that ""Eckman has six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger disgust fear and sadness..."". If a computer was to detect any of these emotions from a student while he or she is working there wouldn't be an easy way of knowing whether the student is struggling or if the student is doing just fine. This quote from ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" shows how FACS (the Facial Action Coding System) won't necessarily be valuable to students when they are in their classrooms working.

Secondly, from

""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" states ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"". The computers students use at home could be the same as the computers they do there work on during class. By saying this there is a possibility that FACS won't even work for styudents when there at school doing work. The quote used above shows that you cant count on FACS to be available for the use of students in class.

Lastly, from the article ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"". If a student had FACS on there computer and they were doing there work in class and they smile because another student did something nice for them, and FACS detected them smiling and then modified their work that could be a bad thing. It could be a bad thing if the student was doing their work and they actually didnt understand what they were doing and now that FACS detected them smiling they are now doing harder work which is a detriment to the student. This quote shows that having FACS on a students computer while they are working in class could be bad.

In conclusion, having the FACS technolgy on a students computer while they are working at school in their classroom is not valuable. The article does not give any examples or ocurrances of the technology to read a students emotions of having any good outcomes. The use of FACS could incorectly detect wether a student is having trouble or not, it only detects basic emotions, and it may not even be available to the use of students depending on the type of computer they use in their classroom.",4

These cars will save people lives when that are on the roads. People think the cars will not save people but kill them. Th e cars have all the same saftery fectures as a normal care and more. These automobels have many sebores such as th Dubbed LIDAR that use a laser beam to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surrounding.This will see thing that the diver would not see when he is driving to help the car stop for thing in frount of the car or see a car coming at you and more you to the side of the road to not get into a accendent.

Also this car will save the owner money on the car and get you places better them puplic transortion. These cars are made from hybrid car so they will same gas wicth will save you move ans some are going to be electroinc cars. Sergey Brin, Google's co-founder, beliver one day in the never future we will have fleets of driverless taxis the will pick you up at your house and take you anywere. this taxis would use less gas then puplic buses not and taxis do wirch will save money.

The only problem about the cars is one question ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" With this one question there are only four place in the united state were you can use driverless cars. the manufacturer should be the one at fault , they should have tesed every system on the cae before it is sent to the owner. But also, their should be a law stating that is you own a driverless car yoou need to get all the sencor on the car cheaked by a profisinol every 6 mounths.

aa771a5,"Venus is simple to see from a distance but it is challenging to see up close.The author of ''The Challenge of Exploring Venus'' suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers its presents. Here are the details that support this idea.

Venus has a repuation as a challenging planet for humans to study. But astronomers are fascinated by Venus. It was once known as the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. Today Venus still has some features that are analogous to Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit. Its basically more like Earth thats why they call Venus as the ''twin''.

NASA are compelling ideas to send humans to study Venus. Solar would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Temperatures would still be toasty at 170 degrees fahreheit but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. These conditions are not easy but they are survivable for humans.

Many researchers are working on innovations that are going to allow machines to last long enough to contribute in Venus. Also, NASA is working on different approaches to studying Venus. For exampe they are making electronics made of silicon carbon. They have been tested in a chamber simulating Venus's surface and it had lasted for three weeks. Most technology have not even lasted a few hours. Which can be a better way for humans to study.

Humans are full of curiosity and can lead us to many things. Studying Venus is worthy but it has many dangers. Like the author said ''we should be filled with doubts and should be expanded to meet very images of imagination and innovation.''   ",3
b1df371,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author introduces an informative article about driverless cars. The good aspects of driverless cars and the bad aspects. I would say that I am for the use of driverless cars. Although driverless cars may cause accidents, handicapped people can finally get around without depending on other people.

When people first arrive to a new place, they don't know their place around and may often get lost. This is much less likely to happen if google is driving for them. And handicapped people, for example i have a big cousin who has crerbal palsy, so he cannot drive. Therefore he catches the bus and walks alone. Well with the google self driving car, he can just tell google where he wants to go and he's in a good position to make it there. Much safer and faster than walking or catching the bus.

While self driving cars have been known to need help in hazard areas or accident areas, they are great for teenagers trying to learn the road. A question i have is if there is an accident caused by the self driving car is it the ""passenger"" or the manufacturer. I say the manufacturer because before the car is released it should be perfected not to have accidents but driving in driverless cars would decrease accidents among drunk drivers and texters, so i am and forever will be for driverless cars.

6dfd8bf,"In the story ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author discused the advancement of today's technology but I believe it may be to advanced for our own good.

For example in paragraph 9 it says that driving laws are mainly focused on keeping the drivers and passengers safe and that their main goal is to make driving more safe. I dont find it safe to have a driverless car because people shouldn't put their trust and dependence in a smart comupter.Also again in paragraph 9 they say if there were to ever be complications and caused someone to be injured who does the blame fall on. I feel asthough driverless cars are to much of an advancement and that humans should drive because computers make mistakes just as a person. Driving is a learning skill that takes practice not something that can be programed into a device.

Another reason Driverless cars shouldn't be passed through because in some situtations a smart computer doesnt have all the answers. For example in paragraph 7 it states ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves"" driving requires communication and directions within one driver and another. In short, having driverless cars is like ID in foreden theory because a driverless car has no fliter or emotions. Its like reckless endangerment because you never know what will happen when your not in control of your own vechile.

Finally, in paragraph 3 it says having smart-road systems are too expensive. Spending millions of dollars on technology that doesn't assure our safety is a waste of money that couldve been spent on better.

In short, There are some advanced technology that have helped inproved safety precautions and some thats too advanced for our develpment. We shouldn't risk our safety letting a lifeless computer drive us around trying to be more safe.",3
b2a522e,"Education is continuously changing, as all educators and students know. Though schools think they have done everything they can to make the school experience more beneficial to everyone; such as having ipads so students no longer have to be burdened with excessive books, or putting more electives out that students actually enjoy. Education is in a very revolutionary era right now, but everyone is thinking, what else could they really do? That is when facial expression technology comes into play.

Facial expression recognition technology is still a fairly new idea, so it may be a long time before we see it in any classrooms yet, with that being said, it is a revolutionary idea that helps computers recognize how a human is feeling. Dr. Huang is the creator of this technology along side Prof. Nicu Sebe of the university of Ansterdam. This technology was made so that computers and humans could have better communication, in paragraph 6, the reader is presented with the idea that if you saw a web ad that you disliked your computer could recognize that by the frown on your face and not show something similar to that, and vice versa.

So what could this technology do for schools? Students would be able to express they needed help without even raising a finger. The author displays in paragraph six that they too have thought about the idea that this could really change schools, for example, if a student is watching a video online for help and isn't understanding still, the computer could recognize the students unhappiness and switch the learning style of the video until the student is satisfied. With that in mind, teachers would also no longer have to worry about embarassing a student by asking if they need extra help, or worrying that a student is too scared to ask for help in fear of its peers, that will be eliminated with this technology by recognizing the smallest sign of discomfort. Technology is the future, and with this invention it shows that the education system will not fail and only get better as time goes on, not only in America, but universally.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" Dr. Huang explains in paragraph four, proving that this would be able to be used everywhere. The entire world could use this technology without needing to wait for their countries version to come out because there would be no language barrier,it is working off of nonverbal cues that are universally known and never-changing. technology like this would spread like a wildfire

and schools all over the world would find use for this, if not in the everyday classroom, then the advanced and special needs classrooms. Though it is crazy to think, one day teachers may no longer be needed because of technology like this, making the learning experience more personal and less guarded at all times, which every student wants.

Technology is the future, it will always be there and will constantly keep evolving. With new inventions such as the facial expression recognizer it shows that technology will continue to make life easier and learning better. In years to come it is hoped that we will have these revolutionary machines in every school universally, anything to make learning better for the students. ",5
db39406,"Driverless cars are starting to make it into the world. These cars have chips and different items that allow the car to drive alone, but will tell the the driver that he/she needs to take over the wheel when the car can not make it through a sitution. These cars are a bad idea for the world and can be very dangerous. The cars have a self driving system and tell the driver to take the wheel when needed, but what if the driver has fallen asleep or has had something happen to them, they will not be able to take control of the car. Therefore, self driving cars are a bad idea for the world.

Driverless cars do not allow the world to be driverless. People will still have to drive the cars when something happens that the car can not handle. The article states, ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash,"" but what if that next mile something in the car goes wrong and the car crashes. Google explains how their cars are not completey driverless. The cars will alert the driver to take over when the car can not handle the sitution that they are in. So, what is the big difference between someone driving the cars full time or having a car that drives itself unless something happens?

There is no difference when it comes to picking the right choice. The driveless car is a fault and can not keep people safer on the roads. People could eaisly get unfocused and not pay attention to the warning sign that the car gives to take over. If the car tells the driver so many times to take over the driver could get use to the signal and not pay attention when the signal goes off. For these cars to work they way they have to work ""they [need] a whole lot of sensors."" What would happen of the builder of the car forgets to put a sensor in, or one of the sensors does not get programed the right way? Then when the car is driving something happens because a sensor was not placed or had a default. Then who will the blame be placed on? The driverless car or the actual driver who was told by a sign that they needed to take over, but the sign never came because a sensor was missing. The world would most likely believe that the driver was not paying attention and that it is their fault.

Now the car does have some really nice features, but can these features live up to the name? The cars have ""sensors [that] can cause the car to apply breaks on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine,"" that is a nice feature but again what if the sensor quits working. The whole idea of a driverless car is a good idea until a person finds out that they must trust sensors to alert them when they need to take over. In the article it talks about how there could be a object of some sort that keeps the driver awake and alert incase they have to take over. What if the driver gets so into the object that is supposed to keep them alert that they do not feel or see the signal. Another thing that could go wrong is if the driver thinks that they will not have to drive the car they may turn around to take of kids in the back and not see the sensor or feel it. Then you have a bad crash that puts not only a single person in trouble but several people.

The whole idea of driverless cars is a good idea, but with good ideas there are things that can go wrong that people have to think about. A driverless car is a serious thing to think about before they get soild to the public. The people who create the cars need to be able to promsie that the cars are one-hundred percent safe to the public and that they are trust-worthy. The people who make the cars can not promise that one-hundred percent becuase they can only make the cars to their best and after it is the a dealer shop they can not take back what happens. These cars could make a lot more crashes happen and that could lead to a rise of death rates. These cars are not super trust-worthy, therefore, they should not be put out of the market for people to buy.",5
7fc1003,"What is the Electoral College? The Electoral College is a process ,not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between elections  of the President  by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. In the United States people select a president every three years. They would either select their president  by Electoral College, or by the most popular vote.

Voting by Electoral College is not safe at all,they should change it to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. When you vote by elecoral vote it is never guaranteed that they are going to vote for who you wanted to  vote for. They might even change their mind at the last second ,so you never know what they are about to do. Some rich people can pay them to buy off their votes. Then ,boom you lost a vote  it might result to a tie or lost. According to paragraph 11 ""In the same vein,''faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast and deciding vote for whomeverthey please..."". You never what  could happen ,it is like taking a very riskfull risk and every votes matter .Just one vote can make a very big difference. Further more,voting by popular vote would give you a better chance of getting your candidate to win .When you are the one that elects the President you feel more confident and good .You'll know that you voted for the one you wanted to win and the one that you think that will change everything the way you wanted to. Also ,you don't have worry about anything else ,like people going in the voting box and taking the votes  out. Once you vote ,your vote is immediately safe.

In the other hand,voting by Electoral College  benefited us .Obama which is the current president of the United States wouldn't probably be president if it wasn't for them. Accordind to the last article ""In [2012's ] election ,for example ,Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney....'' That means their votes helped Obama win. Also' the Electoral College avoids problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast. Winners take all methods in awarding electoral votes for what they've done.

To summarise my reasonnings  Electoral College votes should be change to election by  popular vote  for the president of the United States. Peoples should be allowed to vote on their own. Everybody would be much happier .Without happy people the country would be upside down. Put this question in your  mind,what would you do if you were running for president  ,and they told you Electoral College would be voting?    ",4
61e9aa0,"Venus' average temperature of over eight hundred, clouds of sulfuric acid, and great atmospheric pressure makes it highly unlikey for inhabbitting. Despite these conditions, it is considered Earth's twin. This is because of the similar size and density of the two planets. For these reasons, and more, the exploration of Venus has been attempted. But what makes dangers of traveling there worth what could be found? Is this topic done justice from by the author?

What would make the danger of going to Venus worth it? In paragraph four, the author states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once been the most Earth-like [...] a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" In the sentences taken from the article, the author mentions how Venus is covered in mountains, valleys, craters, and how there is a possibility of it being covered by ocean many, many years before hand. Right after, the author says that there have been theories about how it could have supported various life forms. Later on in paragraph four, the author states that Venus has a similar terain to Earth and is the nearest option and and crucial consderation. The author could have done more to support the idea that Venus is worth studying. They gave three pieces of supporting evidence on why it was worth studying and did not go on to further explain why these three examples made Venus worth studying.

Do the dangers of Venus outweigh the reasons to study it? The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" belives they do not, but lacked a further explanation as to why. There were good ideas brought to the table about why Venus would be worth the dangers of the exploration. However, the author briefly mentioned them in one paragraph and did not elaborate on their reasons. ",3

Venus is an second planet for the sun. Sometime Venus is called the ""Evening

Star,"" because Venus is one of the brightest points on light in the night sky. Venus also have a nickname like other planets have different nicknames. Venus nickname is misleading.

-

Earth, Venus, and Mars are our other planetary neighbor, they orbit in a different speeds. there is a time when Mars is getting closer to our planet Earth and there is a time when Venus is getting closer to the Earth.

Often Venus referred to as Earth's twin because Venus is the closest planet to

Earth in a size and occasionlly the closest in distance.

-

Like other planets have atmosphere and different temperture, Venus also have atmospere and differents temperture. When a spaceship when to Venus it couldn't survived the landing for more than a few hours because unlike Venus's surface is hottest in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.

Venus's clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in it atmosphere.

Venus may be dangerous but sometime it can be our nearest option for a planetary visit. Long ago, Venus was like our planet Earth because back then it has trees and same atmosphere as Earth. But now Venus is dry up and only a dry vellays where water used to flow a montains left.                ",1
afa4abd,"The use of the the Facial Action Coding System technology in a classroom is valuable. The FACS helps people read the emotional expressions of other people. This is valuable in a classroom because it can let teachers know how students are feeling of the lesson they are being teached and it can help them know how students are feeling in general.

One reason why the FACS is a great technology in a classroom because it can let teachers know how the students are feeling towards their lesson they are teaching to them. When students are being teached something, they some times show expressions on how they feel but tend to hide them. ""A classroom computer can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. This can help teachers find out why aren't students understanding the subject; they can either be bored or confused. Students are some times scared to ask for help, but teachers knowing when students are confused, he teacher can help them individually. This is a great tool to use when students are failing classes, or having trouble understanding a lesson. Without the FACS many students could be failing their classes due to not knowing what they are doing. It is helpful for teachers to recoginze the students expression towards the subject, so they can figure out if students are confused. Knowing that tecahers can give them extra help.

Another reason is it can help other people in the classroom figure out how their classmates are feeling. Students aren't always happy and some times have something tough going on with their lifes, they need that little motaviation

to help them feel happy. ""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are tryingto hide their emotions,"" notes Nick. Some times classmates aren't really feeling happy, they could often have trouble smiling for several reasons. The technology can help others know how they are feeling so they can help other people with their problems they are facing. The FACS is very useful for students who have friends in their class. Friends some times lie about their emotions. The FACS can let them know their emotions and can help them if they show saddness.

In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It is helpful in many ways. It helps teachers know when students are confused and are hvaing trouble understandin the lesson. It also helps classmates know how their friends in the classroom are feeling, by finding out their expression.    ",4
7afcfe2,"The author is right study Venus, in the text it says that it is earch twin and that Venus has mountains and other things like earth so they could have had life there a long time ago. Even though it will be a struggle to study Venus it would be worth it beacuse it could be a second earth. It would be hard to get on the surface of Venus the average temperature is over 800 degrees.

The study of Venus would be hard but NASA has one compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. They would have to hover/float above the fray at about 30 or more miles above the landscape and the air pressure would be close to Earth sea levels it wont be an easy conditons for humans but surviable. However they would have to get close to Venus surface so that they could get rock samples. That's why the author says they would need to make a machine to last a long enough time to cotribute meaningfully on Venus. Venus is our sister planet it is inhopitable,still today Venus still has some features like Earth. The planet has a rocky surface and has valleys,mountains, and craters. In the text the author says;""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit"".

Venus can one day be a livning condtion for us people on Earth that's why the author wants us to study the planet in the last paragraph the author says;""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expaned to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

369a78f,"There are many good reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys. For example they get to help others from different cultures, the seagoing cowboys can learn about their different cultures, and maybe even learn a different language. The seagoing cowboys get to deliver different animals arcross the ocean to also help others in need of livesock. Seagoing cowboys helped a lot to help fix the ruins that World War II left behind.

After delivering the animals or other things the seagoing cowboys get to go exploring in the area that they had to ship the animals and others to.

1fd6b7f,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a paper that sets out to support that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. After analyzing the paper, I am prepared to make the claim that the author fails to do so. He/she presents a vast array of information on the dangers of exploring Venus, as well as the challenges of doing so, but forgets almost entirely to argue that studying Venus is still is worthy pursuit. The majority of the essay focuses on setbacks, not rewards.

The author begins by explaining how spacecraft cannot survive on Venus long, and that previous missions have been short for that very reason. The pessimistic tone is continued in Paragraph 3, where the author describes the formidable heat, pressure, geology, and weather of Venus, and how such intense conditions would complicate research efforts. It states, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of hihgly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" In paragraphs 5 and 7, possible ways to combat these road blocks are discussed. Left out of the conversation is the ""why?"" The author describes NASA's efforts to bipass Venus's problems (like designing a hovering device or considering the use of mechanical computers) but doesn't fill readers in on why such pursuits would even be worth the effort. The question, ""We can, but why should we?"" is not answered.

To say that the author was not successful in vouching for rearch of the planet Venus is not to say that attempts were not made. Paragraphs 4 and 8 make a few attempts at telling readers why researching is still a good idea. The author informs readers that Venus is of-interest to scientists because it is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Mentioned also is that Venus is sometimes the closest option for planetary visitation, making its exploration a more economical choice than other planets. Paragraph 8, the conclusion, says, ""Striving to meet he challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Here the author is saying that Venus should be studied because we can gather information, and humans are curious. This is not science or fact-based, and is not strong because it is common knowledge, not argumentative material. If addressing why researching Venus is a worthy pursuit is supposedly one of the focal points of the 8-paragraph paper, evidence supporting it should be found in more than two places.

In conclusion, ""The Challlenge of Supporting Venus"" did not do a good job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In fact 6 out of the 8 paragraphs talk mostly about what a struggle exploration would be, and the work it would require. It focused more on giving the reader facts and figures about why studying Venus would be difficult, nearly impossible, even, but it did not thoroughly explain why such difficulties should be worked through, or why researching Venus is a fruitful and worthwhile endeavor.",5
a32a2ff,"Since the movie ""Back to the Future"" people have been wanting flying cars and robot things, but driverless cars are a very bad idea to make. The idea in thought is good cause the kid inside us is happy but for it to go out on market would cause more problems than the law can handle. A car that can drive itself is a bad idea, because the money needed to make it should be spent on better things, unempolyment would drive to the sky, and learning to drive will be unneeded until its to late.

First of all, the money needed to make the programs and the cars should be going into better things. The money to make and test the program could have gone into building a new neighborhood for the homeless families liveing in shelters. The safety part of the program that needs to be tested is useing alot of cars that will be crashed and alot of people getting paid to watch the crashing of cars that could have been use to test a new strain of food that can grow faster.

Secondly, a lot of jobs are lost in the making of a driverless taxi service. If people stop buying cars then dealerships throughout the country will close down and people will be laid off. To have that many people without jobs, or have jobs lined up after, that would hurt America more than it could handle. All the people who are driving taxis would be not needed when it is cheaper and safer to use the driverless cab.

Lastly, driverless cars would make learning to drive an unneeded skill. People would slowly stop learning to drive and forget how to. When the car gets hacked by something and you need to drive the car to save yourself the skill isn't there so you crash anyway. Meaning that people would die in car accidents caused by hacking and no one knew how to drive to get out of the problem at hand.

In conclusion, a driverless taxi service is a very bad idea, becuase money could be used for better things, the jump in unempoliment would sky rocket, learning to drive will be unimpornat until it is imporant. Don't stop dreaming and slowly get to that goal, but never make it unneeded to drive a car. ",3
39a2689,"The main characters were Luke and his friend. Basically the story is about his friend giving him a once in a life time opportunity. He first worked at a grocery store and and the bank. When his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldnt say no. So then he went.

He had graduated from high school and had 2 jobs but whem his friend invited him to Europe his whole llife had changed. Since there was a war he went to go help out. He and Don had signed up to be a segoing cowboy. 44 nations joined toggether and formed a UNNRA and he was hired to be a seagoing cowboy. That when you have to take care of horses , mules adnd young cows. That was his job over there in Europe.

He kept going there and he kept helping others. He like his job. The cattle boats were unbelievable for a small town boy it had said. He really enjoyed his job. He toured lots of places like Venice Italy and a city with streets of water. But Luke had made 9 trpis the most of any seagoing cowboy. He traveled across the atlantic ocean and it took him about 2 weeks.

He was taking care of lots of animals and was feeding them 2 or 3 times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats. They had to be pulled. He had helped out his aunt Katie as a boy.

797a3de,"I think I am against the Facial Action Coding System. I do not think it is a good idea to use this on humans without their consent. Technology is important but I still do not think this is a good idea.

Using this on humans isn't a good thing. If they want to keep an emotion hidden then I don't think it is a good idea to uncover it. How can the world be a positive place if the happy people who made you happy weren't actually happy. What if that person had a death of a family member and wanted to keep it a secret but some random person starts snooping around and tells everyone that that person isn't actually happy. Since the article can tell a fake smile from a real smile it could possibly happen. Now if the person gives you consent then it is fine but nobody should be able to read someones emotion.

Now the thing about the facial recognition being in a classroom might make it more interesting. It there was a way to make school more interesting than that would be great. I'm not sure how far it would go to make the students happy. It says that it could modify the lesson like an efective human instructor but how far would it modify it. Also if this became a thing would it take the place of teachers. If so than that would be a bad thing. So many people would lose their jobs. It says that it would be able to tell if I am confused which is a good thing. That way I wouldn't have to ask the teacher to come help me. They would just know and come help me, but I still think it is a bad idea.

I'm just not sure that it is a good idea to have something that reads emotion. I feel like some things that are better off covered up will be uncovered. Technology will consume our world if we are not careful.",3
17ec828,"How would you feel if robots had your life in their possesion? Driverless cars are being developed by many different manufacturers. Driverless cars are not safe enough to be put on the road, as they can cause accidents and injuries if they glitch out or malfunction.

Driverless cars are a bad idea and will be a big problem going into the future. One reason is becasue the cars can cause an accident and seriously injure someone that wasn't even driving. In fact, traffic laws in most states do not allow driverless cars to be on the road, as the cars have not been proven safe enough to handle most extreme conditions.

Another good point is the cars could have a glitch in the system and get into an accident. The robotic cars would be in complete control of the passenger's life and other's once it starts driving on the road. If they do not alert the passenger to take the wheel, it could injure them and other drivers.

A counter-argument could point out that the cars have various safety precautions and will alert the passenger to take the wheel, but glitches in the system could occur and fail to alert the passenger. The manufacturers could get into big trouble even if the car didn't malfuntion because people wouldn't know if the passenger or the car was at fault in the situation.

Driverless cars are not needed in this world. Of course they would be a cool and convenient thing to have around, but they are too risky and dangerous to be brought into everyday life. I do not approve of this until the manufacturers prove that they are safe enough to withstand a storm. The same question could be asked. How would you feel if robots had your life in their possesion?",4
bb9b7d1,"The author supports his idea on why we should study Venus despite the dangers it presents is because acording to the story Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin."" Another thing the article says is that Venus is the closest planet to Earth beause of the density and size. Venus also used to be covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life.

I think we should study Venus despite the dangers because it used to be the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. We can also study it so it can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, but it will take a while to get there. There are also downsides like how will people live in Venus if it is too hot for us to live there or it'll still be hard for researchers to study Venus because researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else because they cannot touch the ground otherwise they will burn. There may be some solutions to study Venus a little bit more because according to NASA they have an idea in which it involves a vehicle. It will look like a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. The vehicle will be hovering over Venus to avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. Although the temperatures will be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit and the air pressure will be a little strong, it will still be survivable for humans.

Those are the reasons on why I agree with the author suggesting that we should study venis despite all the dangers the planet has.",3
ddffcfe,"Have you been dreaming live in another plane in space? or you even born in there? Some people answers yes, some says no, but surely everyone want to live in the space, to see how beauty the space. And in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a article taking abut the problem between us and liveing in space. Before we know more about our Mother plane-Earth neighbor-Venus had some big problem between us! And let us to find out what is those problem betwen us with the secreat plane-Venus!

For a unknow place, there must have some great dangers with it. So, the temperature and pressure are the great dangr for it. in the Venus, ""temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" (3), what is that mean, normaly, when our oven were abut 400 degrees Fahrenheit, we can easly to cook the pizza, beef... many things we need. But in Venus, the 800 degrees Fahrenheit can easly to cook us to well done! Abut the air pressure, the Venus, ""atmspheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our planet"" (3), will, the deeper of our ocean pressure even not close to 90 times greater than our living place, already was a non-life place, so you will be like a water mix with dust to die under Venus air pressure.

The next problem is why we have to studying the Venus? There is not only one neighber for our mother plane, ""Earth, Venus, and Mars, our plaetary neighbor"" (2). So the Venus had such many danger, why we don't study another plane which is Mars were way more nicely to us? But, ""long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" (4) just imagine that, and temperatures with the air pressure would be close to our Earth, and with ocean, similar to our earth! If the weather and pressure were normal, that's mean there must had life born in there!

For it all, the Venus had a lot science reasearch can do after study abut it, form the information we know, imagine the Venus had a, ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"" (5), it's already an be some beatiful place in the Earth, and from today's rock pices left in there, we may can find some animals bone inside there, to know if they had life, hw they may lks like, or to see their live ways. And, ""because mst frms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standering standatd forms of photography and videography ineffective"" (6), a lot of things about Venus we're still guesing, we really don't know the more deeper way about it. Just from a few picture and video can't do anything, the value of the Venus are infinite!

The author did really good job of exlaining the fact of Venus right now, it showd us how importance of it with the infinite value of Venus. like author said, ""Our travels on Earth and beyng shuld not be limited by dangers and doubts but shuld be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (8). nothing in world is easy, and everything we did have danger with it. but we can't just limited by the danger, we fight with it, and the sweet fruits after victry is a dreaming plane were waiting us to live!",4
b01e9df,"You've been waitng for six months now and today is finally the day you take your driver's test. You are beyond excited because you finally get to drive without your parents. There is something so exciting about being behind the wheel because you are the only one in control. Being able to drive your own car car feels awesome. Driverless cars do not get you that same feeling as if you were in complete control. I am against the development of driverless cars, because the driver isn't in control, technology screws up, and who's to blame in the scene of an accident?

There is something so satisfying about being able to drive your own car. Knowing you are in complete control can be a little scary.

Being the person in control can make you more responsible and aware of your surroundings. Driverless cars are not like that, even though they can alert you when there is complicated traffic, you could still doze off or be in the middle of watching a movie. When Google can make cars completely driverless what is the point of ""keeping your eyes on the road"" if the car is already doing that for you.

Technolgy today is very impressive and has come a long way, but still isn't as perfect as the human senses. If you are ""driving"" down the road in a driverless car and you fall asleep. All of a sudden the car crashes because dirt flew into one of the sensors. If you were actually driving the car you would have been able to avoid this situation and been aware of the surroundings. There will always be glitches in technolgy and something could always go wrong.

In case of an accident who is to blame, the company or the person in the car?

Well it is a driverless car, right?, so the driver should be able to do things that normaly can't be done when driving. The company of the driverless car might say it was the drivers fault becasue they were asleep or texting. In general there will be conflict between who's fault it was. In reality if it was a normal car it would have been the driver's fault.

Driverless cars wouldn't be able to give you the thrill of being behind the wheel, technolgy is not perfect, and in the event of an accident who is to blame. Driverless cars really show how developed technolgy has become. When it comes to safety, we already have drunk drivers so the roads don't need driverless cars getting into accidents as well. ",3

That is just one of many very well told reasons in the article that the author provided to state why we should keep studying Venus despite the dangers it presents. THe author provides information that pushes people to want to know more.

In the article the author provides us with information on the ways how humans have studied Venus. In the the article the author tells the reader how humans have sent a lot of spacecrafts to study Venus but no spacecraft survived for such a long time on just landing on Venus. The author expalins that that is the reason to why no furthur studies have been made in over three decades.

Another thing of information that the author provides the reader with is to why the atmosphere is challenging for us. In the article the author provided the reader with information like the degrees and pressures of the atmosphere. In the article it is said to be over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater than the pressure on earth. Also on the discovery on the thirty plus miles abover surface tempatures change to 170 degrees and the pressure changed close to the sea level on earth giving the impression that its survivable for humans. This discovery make scientists want to know more on why that is the case, leading them to keep making new discoveries no matter the challenges it brings them.

The last thing the author provides its readers is with imformation on what NASA is working on to know more about Venus. The author states how NASA is working on different approaches to studying Venus. They are working on simplified electronics which some have in fact worked and have lasted for three weeks. It has studied and has gathered more information.

The author states many information for the reader that supports to why the idea of studying Venus is worthy of pursuit, the more interesting information she provides the more the reader would want to know. The reader would think it is worthy to pursuit to get more discoveries and know the planet further more. ",4
fbb5a77,"The Electoral College is a system that should no longer be used because it is based on an outdated system from the first years of our country's independence.  It would be much more beneficial to use the popular vote as the final vote.  One reason is that one canidate can get more votes, but still lose the election! Another is that many states never get to see the potential president speak, as to make their descion.  Lastly voting would be easier to count and to understand for citizens and those who work the election.

In 2000, the electoral college failed to properly represent our country's people.  More people voted for Al Gore, but Bush still won the election.  In the states where Bush did win, it made the people who voted for Al Gore insignificant and their votes would never again be considered.  Even if in every state a paticular canidate won by one vote, that person would still get every electoral vote, because they won the state, this is mostly an issue in large states.  This is unfair to the losing canidate because their voters never really got a chance.  If it was a popular vote, voting would be much more direct and easier to understand.  Citizens might even be unaware that they aren't really voting for the president, they are voting for their electoral college representative.  With popular vote, there would be no more confusion, and no more worrying about comparing the two voting methods.

Another reason is that some states may never get a chance to see their potential president speak.  Potential presidents tend to go speak in swing states, or states that may vote either for them or for their opponent, since it is based on the states vote not the individual people.  When a president goes to speak in a swing state they are convincing people that it will be a better choice to vote for them, not the other canidate.  If somebody lived in Rhode Island, for example, they would never get the chance to see their potential president speak, therefore they would have to make their descion based on television speeches, newspaper articles, etc.

Also states that tend to vote one way or another often do not get visited because there is no point in trying to convince a state to vote for you that is definitley already going to vote you, to vote for you, and vice versa.  Swing states with high populations are really the only states that are visited.  It is no promise that the potential president will go to every state or even every region, but they will more likely than not visit different states than they would have before.  If popular vote decided who would become president, it likely would no longer be true for presidents to only visit swing states.

Last, the entire election process would be much more simplistic.  There would be a whole group of people who no longer would have to be a part of the process, and the less people, the less mistakes.  Also each state could still add up their votes, then add all the state's votes together and voila, the president has been chosen, by the people.  There would be no more arguments as to who really won the election, as in popular vote versus electoral college.  Also there would be much less of a chance for a tie, the more numbers the less each number is worth.  Overall, the electoral college adds unecessary complications to a potentially simple system.

The popular voting system would still be difficult to take care of, but much better than the previous system, the despised electoral college.  Throughout the years we have seen twice where our course of history could have been radically changed, with a different president.  The popular vote system would increase the power of the people, allow more people to see the president speak, and get rid of unecessary complications and confusion of the electoral college.

50af4f8,"Dear State Senator

People should make a better choice on who they pick as president. Some people choose wrong, and the electoral collage needs to vote for us so that they make the right choice. The only reason I think this is because the electoral collage has never let us down.

I like that we have some one to vote for us.

Senator take this to heart we need this process for the people and the government. The only reason I like the process is because I would choose somebody over what they say not over what they do. I belive that some one should be picked as of their history and manners and honesty not over popular vote.

This process is the only process that they need to help us make the right choice. The right choice would be Obama or Kinnedy or some one like that. The wrong choice is that charlie chris who wants to be a governor, well for now he wants to be a governor next he will want to be a president. The process of electoral collage needs to be here.

The only reason we need not to vote on the popular voting thing is because people vote wrong vote right for once huh. Come on the voting thing where we vote and the popular vote wins isn't right out of however many presidents we've had we've only got under a half of them right. We need this process for the same reason we need new presidents lately.

Do you see why we need not to vote by popular vote now? We need to stick to the electoral collage process or we won't be in good hands with presidents that is. Don't make us go back to popular vote thing please. We don't need popular voting at all so thats all i have to say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ",2
9cde242,"Dear Mr. Senator,

I have decided to express my opinon to you about the Electoral College process for electing the President of the United States. This process should be abolished as soon as possible for it is corrosive to the American peoples opinon. We should instead switch to a popular vote by eligble American citizens to decide presidency.

Now some fellows might argue that the Electoral College is favored by the people. When in fact, as Bradford Plumer points out in paragraph 9, ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". Some people may also say that the Electoral college ecourages the president to visit all states, when in fact smaller states still are not treated the same as states with more electoral votes. A president would rather spend their time investing and giving information to a state such as Californa who have 55 electoral votes, who feel more inclined to think about their decision due to their involvement, rather than a state with 3 electoral votes who dont invest as much thought into their votes.

In grade school we are taught that popualer votes most accurately represent what a specific population wants, why dont we use it in the real world? If your princible wanted to figure out what color the students wanted their yearbooks, she would not elect people to decide for each class! In the Bush and Gore election, Bush recived less votes by the American people but won presidency because he accuired more Electoral votes than Gore. That means that more American people wanted Gore, but the fate was chosen by 271 people, who selected Bush as the winner!

The Electoral College also increases the risk of a tie and if one occured, the election would be disrupted by the unorderly process of which we would have to take to decide the president. In 1968, a change of votes from just 41,971 people would have tied the electoral votes due to the even number of 538 Electors.

The overall idea im trying to express is that the Electoral College is a poor way to show peoples opinon, and much rather focuses on that of 270 individuals who in the end, decide the President of the United States. I hope you can see my points and I long for the day when the president is decided by the people.    ",4

Driverless cars are very posible today because of the advancing technology and the knowledge of the car makers. The new wave of innovation is coming wth the driverless car. There is no doubt that driverless cars are the way of the future and are good for the well-being of the human population.

Driverless cars are not only the way of the future but they would be highly effective. Driverless cars would be good for society because of the safety standards that would be the driverless car. Driverless cars could reduce the risk of collisions and accidents because of the technology that is in the car. Driverless cars would not only be good for the driver but for the other drivers on the road. Many accidents on the roads are caused because of reckless driving but with the driverless car the crash rate could go increasingly down.

Driverless cars could reduce the risk of accidents beacuse the car would be able to drive itself. Drunk driving, texting and driving, and falling asleep at the wheel would not even be an issue for a driverless car. Take a person who is intoxicated and put them behind the wheel of a car. The person behind the wheel is dangerous to other drivers on the road. With the driverless car the intoxicated driver would not even have to drive and would not cause as many deaths or crashes as the regular car. It is the same thing with texting and driving and falling asleep at the wheel the danger of those before the driverless car is at a high rate. With the technology and the sensor ability of the driverless car the total numer of accidents and death on the roadways would go way down with the driverless car.

The driverless car would be much more effective than regular taxis of buses in large cities. The first thing is the environmental help of the driverless car. It is projected that the driverless car would use half of the fuel that the taxis today are using. With so much of the environmental concerns today about the poluted air, the driverless car would be an environmentally friendly car helping out with keeping the air cleand in big cities. The driverless car is also much more flexible and productive in terms of public transportation. With a lot of driverless cars able to help with public transport the fluidity of the public transportation system would speed up.

The driverless car would have no schedule like the taxi drivers have today. With the help of the driverless car people would get to and from quicker and there would be no taxi or bus fee as there is no driver. Driverless cars could change the whole outlook of city life and possibly change the world.

The driverless car would have so many good qualitits like saving the lives of men, women, and children as well as saving the environment of the great earth. Driverless cars are the way of the future and are good for the society. There is no doubt that driverless cars are the way of the future and are good for the well-being of the human population.                 ",4

698fc7b,"I know for a fact that the Face on mars is not an alien artifact. Instead i know that it is just a normal landform. One of my reason for saying that is simple,on paragraph two it states""Only this one had an unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh,""but that is not my only reason for saying it is just a mesa. I will be explaing why i think that this landform on mars is just a natural landform.

First,i will continue to explain the shadows that gave this landform a face. On paragraph 3 the article states that the landform was given shape by shadows. the face parts the shadows gave were eyes,mouth and a nose. Also on paragraph two the article tells us that this landform was just another Martian mesa,which was common enough around another planet called Cydonia.

Next,i will be explaining the three diffrent pitcures that were taken,and how the (moc) knew how it was just a regular landform and not an alien artifact. On paragraph seven it tells us how the second time they took another pitcure of it,but with a better camera. Many people were very anxious to see teh first image appear on a JPL web site,revealing that it was just a natural landform.

That's not all,one paragraph eight,it states""but not everyone was satisfied"". After that on paragraph nine mission controller looked at the face again,but it was not easy finding it,so they searched for the face until they found it again on April 8,2001. Then the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look,they took the pitcures using a camera's absolute maximun resolution. If there were any objects like Egyptian-style pyramids you could see what they were.

My position in driverless cars is that I'm opposing them.

Even though Google cofounder Sergey Brin can, I'm not ready to put my life nor my family's life on the line even after years and years of people testing them and making the driverless cars 100% safe.

Electronics always mess up somewhere down the road, even 100% safe, so why trust a driverless car when it could mess up and put your whole family's life on the line.

In the text it say's that ""Driver's need to stay alerted at all times"" but why if this car is 100% safe, aren't we aloud to sit and talk to are family while we are on the move.

The text also stats that ""If there is a wreck who's going to be the blame, the owner of the driverless car or the manufacturer"" so why buy it if you might be the one to blame and not the manufacturer who made this 100% safe driverless car.

My points go to prove why I'm sticking to a car I can personally drive and not a car that's still not 100% safe on the road yet.

So I ask you, would you like to move on with the rest of the world and put your life and other people's lives at risk every day with a driverless car or a car that you can drive and help keep others safe.

Stay safe and go against the flow sometimes, could be for the best.",3
6a28e7c,"A face on mars! NASA found a face on mars that is said to be a natural landform but many think it is alien creation. There are many reasons that shows that claim of it being an alien creation is false for example there have been 3 pictures of the ""face"" the face looks different in each, it is a lava dome, and there is not a reason for NASA to keep it a secret.

In the article they give 3 pictures to look at and in each one the landform looks a little different because of the new advance technology. For example the picture in 1976 yes it does look like a face but that could be just because of the low camera quality at the time of the picture taken. The picture could've been anything at the time a rock formation is and was the logical explanation for this. For example in the second picture taken in 1998 the landform is a little blurry but easier to see and in this picture it doesnt resemble a face at all it was revealed to be a natural landform. The example shows that NASA confirmed that it is just a natural landform and is not an alien creation. It does not even look like a face in the sharper picture take in 1998. The last example is the picture taken in 2001. Many thought that the picture taken in 1998 was not proving anything because it would have been winter in mars so the picture had to be taken through wispy clouds so they went again in 2001 they went on a cloudless summer day. For example in the passage it says,"" Malin's team captured an extra ordinary photo using the camera's absoulte maximum resolution."" The example shows that NASA took an amazing clear photo revealing that it is just a land form.

In the article there are three different missions. In the first mission they fiqures it was just another common Martian mesa. For example in the text it says,"" Scientist fiqured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows."" The example shows that they said that it is just mesa with unusual shadows. The next mission sais that it is indeed a natural landform. For example in the story it says,""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginial viking photos and posted on a JPL web site revealing a natural landform."" The example shows that the new cameras showed that it was just a landform but that still wasnt enough evidence to some. The third mission was in 2001. For example in the text it says,"" a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look."" The example shows that this mission was on a cloudless day so there would be nothing blocking the view of the landform. All three missions they all agreed it was just a natural landform

Why would NASA want to hide it and there is enough evidence that it is just a natural landform There would be no reason to ""hide"" if aliens were found. For example in the text it says,""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars."" The example shows that if there was a civilzation they would not keep it a secreat because they could get more money to study it and in the long run more money for discovering it. Another example is in the story it says,"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes ont he ground or Eqyptian-style pryamids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" The example shows that if there was ancient civilization there they had to live somewhere and we would be able to see their shacks. The last example is in the story it says,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equaivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of the middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" The example shows that it is a butte or mesa and it even looks like the middle butte in the River. There is no way the ""face"" is anything but rocks.

In conclusion there is no evidence what so ever that the landform is an alien creation. There was though 3 missions that have evidence showing that it is a landform, there were three different pictures,and there was no reason for NASA to hide this dicovery. The ""face"" is just a natural landform. ",6
65a777f,"Studying Venus is a very interesting thing . He very-well wrote the article "" The challenge of exploring Venus "". He includes almost everything a person should and needs to know about the planet . You can tell just by what he has written that he is good at his job , and knows what he is doing. In my own personal opinion , i think he needs to add a little more detail and answers.

I happen to have a few questions myself . For example , how long has it existed ? Is it one of the oldest or newest planets ? Are any non-like humans able to even live there or would they explode from how much pressure/heat is on them? Why is it so hot there?

If it's not because of the sun , then what causes it ? I could go on but i think you get where i'm coming from. Because he didnt answer every question that could have been answered , im left with curiosity . Other than that , he did a very good job at explaining what happens on Venus . I also dont think it's very smart how he said "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation "" .

It's definitely nothing to play around about , it's very serious and dangerous.

Peoples lives are at risk and i don't think they want to die on purpose. People have families and would like to live long enough to return back to earth to see them. They put their lives at risk everyday just to discover things from outter-space or things on another planet.

394ce95,"The ''face'' is just a natural landform, formed by dirt or sand in the ground.

If it was to be created by aliens, there would have been signs of alien life by now, but there isn't. To top off the reason that the ''face'' is a natural landform formed by dirt or sand or some unknown substance, there is also other weird-shaped looking objects in the ground next to the ''face''. No alien life has been found yet, so with that being said, there shouldn't even be a possibility that aliens created it.

If aliens created the ''face'', there should be footprints or handprints near the ''face'' leading to a possible location showing what may have made it. The ''face'' looks like something buried inside the ground to me, more than something inprinted in the ground. The ''face'' may have just been an illusion.

In my opinion, I think the ''face'' may have been created by wind or the movement of the camera causing wind to blow and create this false-claimed ''face''. The ''face'' has later been viewed in new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft has revealed that the ''face'' on Mars is a mesa. ",2

a49aeef,"Cars are a huge advantage in traveling. They can get people to places faster than a single horse could; and their a lot safer than riding on a horse. While there are positive advantages to these moble transportations, there are also negative portions that cars have. You may be awfully suprised what these transports can do outside their good nature. For instance, cars run on fossil fuel, which is a artifical gas that ruins the enviorment as much as people cutting down trees and smoke coming out of nuclear plants that do damage to the clouds in the sky. Cars don't just hurt the enviorment, they hurt innocent lives as well. Let me pull out an example: Person A and Person C are driving on the interstate when Person B spills out too much fossil fuel from the exaust pipe of his car. This causes both Person A & C to spin out of control and crash into each other because they couldn't see the road very well because of Person B. This isn't the only threat cars can pull into, but I'll get to that later. With all these bad occurances that happen people have been wondering, ""how can we save both lives and the enviorment from the issues of cars at the same time""? There is a way to do just that: limiting car usage.

Like I said before, cars can have a lot of negative issues in their state of mind. Some examples are foggy weather, over usage of fossil fuel, speeding, texting and driving, drunk driving and many more that exist that I cannot mention. Because of these issues, cities like Vauban Germany, Paris France and Bogota Colombia have banned(well not really banned but you get what i mean) driving cars due to the bad issues cars can/have caused. In the US, the presentage of people driving cars has decreased a lot over the past few years (the story doesn't say what persentage). As much as I hate them doing that, they actually have a reason. In this case of fellow citizens, car usage should be banned for various reasons. I won't be telling all the reasons because that would take a long time to do so.

Reason #1: Drunk driving. Have you ever known someone or heard about an incident were a person is drunk inside a car and crashes into any random source they don't see coming? Well, let us face the facts: drunk people should not drive. If someone is drunk at a bar and is feeling funny, they should either walk home or get someone to pick them up. Drunk people who drive have a great chance at getting someone hurt of themselves hurt because of their stupid attitude. The person shouldn't drive again until they are fully consious again. Reason #2: Extreme weather. When people drive in extreme, they are risking their lives in a greater persentage than a zombie apocolypse, terrorists invading any country and being attacked by people who try to kill you. Extreme weather like thunderstorms, hail and strong fog are too dangerous for people to drive in. If you drive in that type of weather, there is a 90% chance you will not make it out without injuries. People need to wait for the weather to either calm down or stop completely(I just wait until it stops completely so that it wouldn't get worse as it calms down). This will help them prevent them or anyone from getting a wreck. If it occurs randomly while your driving then your screwed. Reason #3: texting and driving. Why is it that most people in this generation keep getting stupid and stupid every single minute? This is one of those incidents that has such that. People who text while driving pay more attention to their stupid phone than focusing on driving. Like drunk driving people who care about texting so much need to either sit in the back and text or not ride in the car at all. They propably should stay away from a car as long as possible until they learn to not text and drive at the same time. You can't do two things at once unless you're some one fictional or a pro at it. Final reason: Expoit of fossil fuels. I don't need to talk much about this one because I already did in my first paragraph and it is related to the extreme weather topic but I will do it once more. Cars that exploit fossil fuels can cause damage to the enviorment. If the smoke is exploited too much it can not only more damage to the enviorment, but it can cause people to reck as well.

These are the reasons that fellow citizens like you should limit your car usages. Remember that cars are not a same transportation vehicle that can get you from point A to Point B, they have a dark side like everything else. Even if you do limit your car usages, it doesn't mean you are safe from the world that hunts you down. Be careful out there and follow the percautions of safty carefully when you are traveling either by car or anyother place.            ",4
866a03f,"Using the Facial Action Coding Sytem is a great idea to have in a classroom.

If the student gets confused on a problem and the computer can read that they are confused and it notifys the teacher the teacher can go over and help the student.

In the classroom there are some students who don't like speaking out or ask questions because they are shy or don't feel smart because they have to ask questions but in this way they won't have to deal with any of that because the computer reads that they are having trouble. In the article it says that Dr. Huang could read how Mona Lisa was feeling just by a computer telling him. This system could also be a way to teach kids how to read how people are really feeling because in today's world no one can fully read how people are feeling.

In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang says "" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that too"" computers should understand that so they can read how people are feeling to make things easier.

a7a7fca,"Driverless cars seems like a futuristic thing that should be happening decades from now. But it is possible for it to happen soon. Maybe not completely driverless since the smart cars are going to be able to need the driver's alert. Driverless cars can be a very big change to the world.

Sergey Brin, Google cofounder, envisions a future that will be able to have a public-transport taxi system with driverless cars. The cars he imagines to be able to happen in the future would use half the fuel of today's taxis. And would be able to offer much more flexibility than a bus could. Sergey Bin says that this could fundamentally change the world.

Google has had cars that could independently drive themselves since 2009 according to the article. Google's cars aren't truly independent because they still require a driver to take over under certain conditions like pulling in and out of driveways, dealing with the complicated traffic issues, or navigating through any accidents on the road.

The self driving cars from Google have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Safety will be soemthing very important for the driverless cars if these were to happen. Car crashes happen oftenly among adults and teenagers that have the opportunity to drive. The causes for the accidents are mostly because people often wnat to be using their mobile devices while on the road. Texting is a problem while driving. It will obviously distract you from watching the road and cause you to be in an accident or just cause one. Manufacturers are hoping to be able to put cameras into the driverless cars so it makes sure that the person taking over the car is watching the road, and car is watching over the person so they can be alert when they have to take over.

Driverless cars seems like a good idea. It can make a big change to the world. Half the fuel can be used which is a good thing since the fuel from cars harms the earth since it causes greenhouse gases. With less fuel being used, the greenhouse gases can be avoided less. Driverless cars can bring upon much more safety since the cars Google has, have driven more than half a million miles without an accident. Which is good since accidents will be less likely to happen with these driverless cars.",3

e2565cd,"Some people choose to say that the Face was created by aliens, but I am here to tell you that it definetly is not an alien structure, simply a natural landform. In 1976 I must say, it certainley did resemble a man made face. Though now that we have a clearer picture from 2001 it is very obviously just a natural landform. It resembles landforms similiar to the ones around the Amercian West. It is really just the Martian equivilent to those particular landfoms. The two are so similar in formation and shape.

The most recent picture is so clear and high definition that even if it werre some kind of shack or Egyptian pyramid, you would know it for a fact. The picture taken in 1998 was on a slightly cloudy day, so I understand the doubt from some of you. Though we did take another picture, and it was on a very clear summer day, and it is mothing but a simple lava dome, that has taken the form of an isolated mesa about the same height os the Face on Mars.

It was very hard work just to try and get that picture, and I would like to assure you that it is definetly no ""Martian Made"" structure. We got very close on a very clear day, and you can definelty see that those were just shadows, and nothing short of a dissapointment. What you don't understand is, that it would benifit us if it was a Martian's craft. It would give the tax payers evidence and reason to support us and give us their money to support the cause. SO therefore I rest my case tht clearly we are not lying because it would benifit us if there were Aliens crafting these thing, but the simple fact is, there isn't.",3

When the photographers took a picture of it, it was as soon as possible. Plus the camera was at its absolute maximum and so u can obviously tell it is a shadow that makes a face. What the picture really shows is the Maritan the same as a butte or mesa land form which is common around the American West. If there were a peron on Cydonia we would be rich finding the greatest discovery of all time. why not have more then just a man lets have a whole colony right?

When Michael Malin flew over it the team got a picture Ten times sharper then the first picture and when people on the internet who just couldnt wait to see what it was guess what they found out it was? A natural landform there is no alien monument after all. There is absolutly no aliens at all at least not that we have found.",2
213db80,"An Electoral College is a process established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualifed citizens. Each candidate running for President has a group of electors who people vote for when voting for the candidate of their choice. The candidate with the most electoral votes and popular votes is the new President. Although this is not a democratic process, we the people still need to keep it for various reason including, having swing states, the votes between bigger states and smaller states, and avoiding run-off elections.

Toss-up states, or swing states, mainly help the outcome of the election. Although they don't elect who becomes President, they are the ones who are more likely to really listen to the competing candidates and know who to vote for than careless voters who vote for no obvious reason or are told to. They are the most thoughtful voters, which could really help the U.S. pick a great President for the next 4 to even 8 years. The more votes from those who pay attention to the election, the better chance of having a great President.

Bigger states are important to the candidates in the election. A larger population would mean more votes, and more votes would avoid a tie between the candidates. For example, Florida is a larger state. In 2012, the popular vote was very close because Florida had more electoral votes. Wyoming, a smaller state, had only 3 electoral votes. In other words, larger states get more attention from presidential candidates than smaller states do.

The Electoral College avoids run-off elections, which is when no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. When there's a tie in votes, great pressure arises and the presidential election process is greatly complicated. The Electoral College avoids this problem, reduces the pressure and produces a clear winner.

The Electoral College may not be a democratic process and may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carring their state, but is important in a variety of ways; including swing states, votes between big and small states, and avoiding run-off elections. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote that may decide an election.    ",4
7bc14b3,"Imagine if you are on an spacecraft, and you see something unusual. It looks like a face on the surface of the planet Mars. Your first instinct might be that it was made by aliens or creatures we have never seen. Well, this did happen; in 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was flying over Mars and they stumbled upon what looked like a humans face, but they were not positive what or why it was there. This Face is just a natural landform because scientists proved it, there was no sign of abnormal activities, and mesas are not unusual in Mars.

This Face is a natural landform because scientists proved it was not made by aliens. The author states, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonai for the first time Micheal Malin and Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. This shows how the Face was only a landform. ""The text states, ""Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. 'We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view' said Garvin. 'Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each Pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This exemplifies how scientists used advanced technology to take an accurate picture of the Face. What they found was that it was a mesa.

Again this shows how scientists took advanced pictures and all they saw was a natural landform.

Furthermore, there was not any abnormal activity to prove it was aliens. Gavin said, ""As a rule of thumb you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" This shows how the camera was powerful enough to have shown if it was really an alien monument. Similarly, Gavin states, ""So, if there were objects on this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This adds on to the idea that if there had been an alien civilization they would have been able to capture anything that was out of the normal.

Additionally, these landforms are not unusual on Mars. Infact, there are similar landforms on planet Earth. The article states, ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" This shows how mesas are common in Mars, and they are not strange to be seen. Furthermore, the text states, ""What the picture shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolate mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'"" This exemplifies how these landforms are not just in Mars, but also on planet Earth. However, this specific landform had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh, but the picture tooken byThe Mars Global Surveyor proves that it was a natural landform. This camera took a picture using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.

Clearly, the Face on Mars was just a mesa. There was no explanation found of how it could have been formed by aliens. First, there was no evidence found that it was an alien artifact; cameras proved that it was a landform. Plus, mesas are not unusual in the planet Mars. The Face seen on the Mars was another one of Mother Nature's ability to create spectacular scenes in the landscape. ",5
820e6c3,"Imagine a world without drivers and how the age of driveless car can become a part of society. With the advancement of technology in todays world, driverless cars

will become another way of how people travel, Anoher way on how danger awareness comes into play, and how safe a driverless can be important to everyday travel.

Everyone has been on a public tranportation before and has either found it helpful to get from point A to point B. But sometimes they want the feeling of not having to deal with others on the bus such as yelling kids, people fighting on the bus , and other issuse that may cause discomfort. They want the feel of having been in a lemozine, where they dont have to deal with anyone else and have a smooth transition from point A to point B.

While having to not deal with others while traveling, there comes a more issue on whether it is safe to have a driver or not.

It can be said that having

driverless cars can become a way of traveling, but what about the safety aspects of it? Imagine that this idea of a driveless can becomes a success.In passage 4 it said that,""The Combination of all this input is necesarry for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a himan at the wheel"".

This would mean that someone wouldn't have to worry about driving because the car would be able to do that for them. It would be safe too because according to paragraph 3, it talks about built in sensors that can sense danger that a human drive might not be able to notice, such as the detection of skidding, speeding, or rollovers. This would minimize the likelihood of an acccident.

Having a driverless can become apart of society as a whole, whether someone is travleing to a party with friends or to not having to be focasing on the road itself while focousing on other things in the car, such as kids, pets, and other things that might become a distraction. As stated in Paragraph 8, sitting in a car for hours can become boring and knowing that someone cannot watch a movie, text, or even sleep, it can be stressful. But with the Driverless car, it would come equiped with heads up displays and car entertainments, so the passenger would never feel bored.

Imagine having a car that drives for a person without that person in control of it. Think of how the age of technology would become more advance and how impotant it will impact the way we travel. Imagine having a driverless car that

will become another way of how people travel, Anoher way on how danger awareness comes into play, and how safe a driverless can be important to everyday travel. ",3
a2c0d13,"In the story ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the autheor suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by stating how Venus is earth's twin,how it's one of the brightest points of light in the sky,how NASA has one ""particularly compelling"" idea for sending humans to study Venus,and the different type of machines and devices NASA are coming up with to travel and explore Venus more and better.

Now i'm going to state details on the the ways I said the author supports the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. It's earth's twin and how it was much like earth before,in paragraph 4 it says venus was probable covered largely with oceans and how it could of had various forms of life like earh is today. It also says how today Venus still has features analogous to Earth,how the surface is rocky sediment and has features such as valleys,mountains,and craters. And then the author said ""Venus can sometimes be the nearest option for planetary visit.""

Then on how the author likes the ideas that NASA is coming up with to visit earth with what he/she said was a ""compelling idea"" and the machines and devices that their making that the author likes as well. They would make vehicle to float above the fray hovering 30 miles above Venus landscape,it would avoid the badly ground conditions by keeping off it. ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" the authoer said. All of thes details are in paragraph 5.

Then in paraagrph 7 the author said NASA is coming up with a machine made of silicon carbide to work on Venus's surface. It has been tested.

2343110,"Dear senater ,

I know befor you were senator you voted just like us and you know how frustrating it can be somethings. The Electoral Collage sould be discarted and Presidents of the united states should be elected by popular vote. If we do the popular vote it will be more efficent and be easier to keep track of. We have to do it because The Electoral collage it's failed to elect a President , the masses (the people) don't get to pick the president, and its outdated.

Firstly, we need to abolish the electoral collage because it has failed to elect a President in the past. In the case of a tie in electoral votes it would be the task of the house of representatives the elect a president and the way they elect the presidnt is worse then the electoral collage. even thought and exact tie in the predidental elections has not occored so the catostrify of the house of representatives electing the presisdent has not happen yet ,but it is entirly  possible.

Secondly, we need to abolissh the Electoral collage because the masses (the people) don't get to the president. In the  electoral collage usage of the system resalts in the

People electing the electors ,to elect the president. And in this system the eletors can pull a switcharoo and vote for the other canadent if they so please, to betray the people by doing so. allthought its system has worked scince the founding of our country ,it is still quirky and disfunctionable at times. the electoral collage allows the electors to do as they please if a elector for florida promises to pick one president and gets all the votes to got to the electoral collage he can choose the Other canadent because his freind wanted him to. how stupid is that!

Thirdly, we need to abloish the electoral collage because it is outdated. in our day and time we have smart phones and aindroids that we can use to vote for the president in the peoples choice. there could be a web site that you can go on to submit your election and at the end of the election the compuster can tally us the number of votes to the exact amount so it would be the peoples choice. its  also outdated becouse we dont need one or a few guys to be sent somewhere to cast the vote of the people , we have so mmusch advanced technology that we can have any legal person who wants to vote can and actually have there vote matter insted of what the elector pick so it matters to those few poeple instead of every single person in america.

In conclusion, we need to abolish the electoral collage because it can fail to elect a president(which is almost did in 1960), the masses (the people) can't elect the president(they have to elect the electers to elect the president, and also is is very outdated. in my opion, we should also consiter tweking the electoral callage instead of just getting rid of it.                                                                                                  ",4
2faa342,"Have you ever wanted to know if you can tell if someone is forcing a smile or a real smile? I agree with the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. By using this technology you can tell how your friends, parents, and even teachers are feeling.

To begin with, You wake up for school and your mom is already making breakfast for you, but you dont know how she was feeling. When you come in the room she would erase ""that"" expression and greet you with a smile like usual. Didnt you wish you could tell how she was feeling and do something to make her feel better? With the FACS you can. 60 percent tired, 25 percent happy, 10 percent sad, and 5 percent angry. So you hug her and tell her to go back to sleep, then you go to school.

In the meantime, you arrive at school and meet up with your friends, but you could tell that one of them isnt as ""energized"" as usual. You would ask them whats wrong and they would probably say ""nothing"" and force a smile. You know that they arent feeling great but you dont want to nag them as well. So then you would use FACS. 90 percent depressed, 2 percent happy, 5 percent tired, and 3 percent angry. You can then calculate that they are depressed because of family problem or school.

Last but not least, according to the article ""we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". Using the technology of FACS can help you ""calculate"" your friend or parent feeling.

Inconclusion, FACS is a technology that allows you to read people feelings and mood. What if your friend is feeling depressed and dont want to live anymore? With FACS you can help them and prevent suicide. FACS can help you ""calculate"" your friend or parent feeling.",4
87afb49,"Do you think computers can tell your emotional expressions? If so why do you think so. In the passage it talks about how the computer calculates your emotions and show what type of emotions you are having. In the paragraphs it talks about people and what there emotions are just by looking at a computer. I honestly don't think this type of thing is valuable to the students at all.

The reason i think it's not valuable is because what do you need to know how people is feeling or not before? If it really was a problem with them they would come up and tell the teacher what's wrong with them. Like for example you can be smiling all day in still not be happy about something. So if it just goes off your facial expressions than i don't think it is valuable. On the other hand if it can see what you really are thinking than maybe it is a little valuable to the students and teahcers at school. So it really depends on how the technology works to really know if it's valuable or not.

In paragragh 3 it tells you all the type of emotions it regonizes .Like for example it say ""your frontalis pars lateralis muscle(above your eyes)raised your eyebrows when you're surprised.""This tells us that just off of face expressions it can tell how you feel. My point is though is what if you have a face expression on your face but that is really not how you are feeling, is the computer going to know that or not because if they don't once again i don't think it's going to be that valuable to people.

In paragraph 4 it states that"" the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,""observes Dr. Huang,""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression""What he was meaning by that is that there are a lot of face expressions you can make & you might look at it one way but the other person might look at it differently than you sometimes. In paragraph 5 it says ""For instance,you can probably tell how your friend or a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course,most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried, ect.""Meaning a frend of yours can have one faical expression on there face but be feeling total different inside.

In this last paragraph i want to know what you think about the faical action coding system. I wonder do you think this is valuable to students in teachers in schools. What are some things that they can do to make this facial thing a little better and things like that. Or would you keep everything the way it is because you like it i want to know what you guys think about this passage.",3
7ebe893,"The use of the FACS is both valuable and not valuable. Humans are very complex, and they can learn to adapt. Humans can learn to be more deceitful and learn to hide thiings better. I know because, I, myself, am a human.

The ability to detect human emotions is not valuable because some humans are embarassed when others know what they are feeling, and they would learn to keep their face neutral while feeling because they don't want to constantly be read like a book by some robot.

This technology could be valuable because you could tell when kids in school are getting mad or even have depression or anxiety. Facs could help us to help the future generations of students to talk about their emotions because they won't have to state how they feel, but a robot would be doing that for them.

FACS is not the best idea because some kids like to keep to themselves and just the thought of eveyone knowing how you feel constantly would give them anxiety and make them fearful to feel because of what others may think and so on and so forth.

I dont think that using this technology is a valuable idea because then the government could end up taking the technology into the real world and using it against the people. I am not okay with being read but a robot, personally.

This technology could also help to keep schools safe, by letting the administration know when someone if looking guilty or even if they are starting to get angry because of something, it could help to stop some school shootings because the students would have a certain emotion to them and then we would know to pull that student aside, or it could help students who have anxiety to tell when they need to step out of class and go for a walk or use their coping skills.

I don't have a straight forward opinion on the new technology because it has alot of pros and cons. I talked about a few in the paragraphs above and while rereading my writing, I realize that I have a neutral perspective on all of this due to how many pros and cons there really are, and the ability for humans to adapt.

The authors first claim for studying Venus being dangerous is carbon dioxide. The author quotes in paragraph 3 saying ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" Telling how its dangerous and how a human could die from breathing in carbon dioxide. This is important because it tells us the risks you can take if you were to get close to Venus.

The authors second claim why it is dangerous to study Venus are the clouds. He said that in paragraph 3 ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmoshpere."" Also telling us that venus had many dangerous features that can harm a human if they were to go to Venus. This is significant because we should know what we are getting into and know how to prevent anything harmful and study Venus without being harmed.

The last thing the author said aboout being harmful was the heat and the atmospheric pressure being way more extreme than planet earths. He said in paragraph 3 ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our own planet. This is explaining to us how Venus is very dangerous in many ways. this is important for everyone because we should know what is around us either way whether we are learning about it or not.

The author Suggests learning about Venus not only to know it better but for us to discover new path way and to know about our surround planets. But nothing would be learned if no one takes a risk in life to study something new. Like the author claims in the last paragraph no one should be limited by dangers. Everyone can overcome and should learn soomething even if it means risking something you don't want to.   ",3
86464c6,"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Well Venus is the second planet from our sun. It is also proved a very challenging place to exmine more closely because Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth. Venus is also the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, it is also clostest in distance too. Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space and humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on the cloud-draped world, and since they went there they don't survive for more than 2 hours.

Also numerous factors talk about Venus being a challenging planet for humans to study. They say it's even more challenging the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric in Venus. The temperature that the planet holds is 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what they experince on our own planet. This is more extreme than anything humans can hold on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, it's amazing because even though Mercury is closer to the sun Venus is still hotter.

Venus has once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. They even say Venus was probably coverd with largely oceans and could also supported various form of life, just like Earth. So basically they are saying it Venus was some what like the Earth. So now in day venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. Venus can also be sometimes be our nearest option for a planetray visit. Venus seems indisputable.

Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. But they thought it as challenges. Also now many researchers are working on making machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. So it can be stronger than humans and they can last longer with Venus. There are still NASA working on other approches to study Venus.

So this is all the inforamtion they have for Venus. It is very powerful and hard to do awhole thing about Venus because humans going over there can die about in 2 hours. ",3

9f8981c,"I belive the devlopment of driverless cars is a great idea. Although none of the cars developed so far are completley driverless, that is something that we will more than likely see in the future, and as soon as 2020. There are many positive outcomes with having driverless cars. One outcome being cars that don't use as much fuel. Another positive from having driverless cars is that they have all kinds of sensors to ensure the safety of the passengers. One other benefit is that they have the ability to notify drivers when they are needed.

A really big and important benefit of having driverless cars is the potential they have to be better for the environment and the economy. Google cofounder Sergey Brin envensions cars that would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus. This would be a great improvement for the environment and the economy.

Another benefit of having driverless cars is that they have all kinds of sensors. One important sensor is located on the roof of the car. It's called LIDAR and it uses laser beams to form a constant updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. The combination of all this input is very important for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. This ensures that the car always knows what is around it to make sure it is driving as safely as possible. With this tool, people don't have to worry about keeping a safe distance from other cars or getting too close to the side of the road. The car has it all under control.

One last benefit of driverless cars is that they have the ability to notify the drivers when they are needed. In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. They notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, like navigatin through work zones or around accidents. In order to notify the driver, some cars announce when they are needed, others have flashing lights on the windshield, and some make the seat vibrate.

Driverless cars exist now, but I belive they will become more popular and advanced as time goes on. I think people will really start to see all the benefits of driverless cars. They can do many fascinating things; things that people would have never even thought of cars being able to do, and that is why I think driverless cars are so beneficial.        ",4

IN this article the example the how we can calculate our emotions is about the face's muscles if you are suprised the most common movement is raises your eyebrows or a smile when you are happy or also tightens your lips when you are angry. We have a lot of expresions that helps us how we feel or how exprese our emotions. This is important because we should know each person it is different and show how many people expresed their emotions by differents ways. ",1
74abe2d,"I think this technology would be very valuable in classrooms. Being able to know about how a student feels about a subject could be very helpful. This would enable Teachers to adjust thier teaching style and make it easier for the student to understand the subject. Not only would it help the teachers, but the entire class as well. Teachers would be able to see if students needed individual help or if they needed to go over it as a class again.

As said in the article, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This also supports the fact that this technology could be valuable in classrooms. Not only the teacher could be able to change the lesson for a student, but the lesson itself could change for the student. This would make the student be less bored and more excited and enjoy the lesson that they are currently learning.

As technology evolves, we will use it more and more for the better use of people. This could possibly be the first step for making school a better place for students to enjoy learning. They could have personal computers that would adjust to thier learning speeds and needs. This would no doubt make school more enjoyable and easier to understand for students that are having trouble.",3
76ffc78,"""Using details from the article, write an essay arguing whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable"". Yes, I do thing using this ""Facial Action Coding System"" is valuble and it could help alot in classrooms and it is a new way of learning. The technology behind this is the computer uses a type of formula to see what muscles are being used more and see how much wieght is being used on every muscle.

Lets all be honest here! I know im not the only one who gets bored or off topic when im learning a new thing or two in class. Or even in genral like if you wanted to learn something new just on your own and you watched videos and go through diffrent web sites to figure it out. But while your doing all an add pops up all of a suddon and it carries you away from what your doing. Lets say if the lesson your trying to learn is in bright colors or in a game format and it really has your attention. Would you then click on the add? Im pretty sure you wouldn't.

Usally in class I even get bored with topic we are on and i may zone out at times and the reason is that the things we learn about arn't really eye opening topics. Like i usally dont want to learn about them but if teachers/computers mixed it up a little and made it fun then that would help me and alot of other students out way more.For example ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human Instructor"". The computer may add some bright colors to the lesson or make it into a type of mystery game that makes you find out what your learning through the game. That would make it so much better to learn the lesson and us student would be more intrested in the lesson.

This technology may not be for everyone.Some people may be ok with the normal old boring way of learning and that may be the best way for them to learn new things. Other people may think that there are workers watching what they do on the other side of the computer. Such as the ""FBI"" becasue people have been reporting things like that and they may not trust this new process.

Honestly other that i think that this is a great idea and we should try this out sometime in the future. It will be a very helpfull piece of technology for the new ways people learn.      ",3
0c2a63d,"Smart cars can do things not all cars can do they can alert you to hit your breaks, steer for you, tell you when things are close around you and ect, but not always it will work so what would happen to the company if the car didn't do its job and someone gets hurt badly?

The author made good negaive arguments and made positive arguements about the driverless car. the author said ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are desgined to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" so hes giving you the postive things that smart cars can help people when they arent doing it themselves or when their not paying attention to the road. well just like the author said ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer"" that's something people should worry about caus eif the smart car doesn't do what is supposed to do if your not steering the wheel or if your not alert whats going on who would the blame for the accident the person driving or the company?

I think that not every smart car will do what they say they do all the time because it may not always know whats its surrounding of the car is so for people to just think the car will always do the right things their wrong. The smart car can have functions where how it should break when you get close to another car, but if the person driving doesn't hit the break and think the car will break its self and doesn't what will happen to the person when the police come will they get in trouble for not breaking when they could have did it themselves instead of thinking the car would have done it for them. ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times"" so by saying this just because you have a smart car and does so much for you while your not doing it your still in danger becaus ethe person behind the wheel should be steering the car to keep everything safe cause the smart cars can not always be safe for people to trust.

Smart cars are starting to take over because they think the smart car will be able to protect people while their not paying any attention, but their wrong smart cars are also dangerous and can put peoples life in danger becaus ethe car will not always be on top of its game and break for you or steer for you people are better off to pay attention to the road instead of letting a smart car do the job for them.",3
a13242d,"The main advantages to limiting car usage would be less accedents and less polution. People dont really know about how many accedents and how much polution cars are responsible for.

to start off with cars can make you very tense and then posibly resulting in a crash. Without cars people would be less tense and be calm every day as they go to work. For example Heidrun Walter said "" When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. "" In the outskirts of freiburg street parking, drive ways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Their streets are completely car free except for the main thoroghfare. Freiburg does allow car ownership but there are only two places to park, large garrages at the edge of the develoupment, where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. As a result 70% of the people do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to be able to live there. People now walk, take the tram, or ride bicycles to school and work, and yet these people are very happy about it. Planes are now taking this concept to the suburbs. They are doing this by putting new building walking distance from those people insted of the malls were people have to drive in order to get there.

in addition to people being less tense banning cars would result in less polution.  Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. After five days of smog rivaled china which is one of the most poluted cities of the world. Diesels were the blame. But finally on monday the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescid the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuseday. This ban also went on to Colombia for three years they have been doing this and they only allow buses and taxies everyone else  gets a $25 fine. Eventually two other colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event. kids now are not even wanting to get a drivers license they would rather walk. these kids get their jobs by looking at the ones that are in walking distance. this is a very good thing because the less drivers the less pollution there is in the air.

in conclusion if we limited the usage of cars people would be more relaxed and there would be less polution in the air pluss people would be gatting exercise so people would benifit from this and our world would be much cleaner.    ",2
66ee32e,"To begin with, the electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president abd vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The electoral college consist of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Each candidate running for presisent in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen bt the candidate's political party.

In addition, the presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in november. You can help choose tour state's electors when you vote for predident.  Most states have a ''winner-take-all'' system however, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ''proportional representation.'' Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in tuen elect the president. The single best argument aganist the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. It's like a hurricane for a presidental election. Prehaps the most worring is the prospect of a tie in thre electoral vot. In that case, the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

To futher inform, at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spen time in states because they no they have no chance of winning. it's like convincing pigs to vote for you. It's offical the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. It's hard to say this but Bob Doloe was right abolish the electoeal college!

The electoral college restores some of the weight in the politiccal balance that lage states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the consition. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recives a majority of the votes cast. It can be argued that he electoral college method of slecting for the presisent may turn off potential voters for a candidate. But athat single vote may decide that election!               ",2

e7b6eea,"When people hear the word transportation, the first most likely thing that comes to ones mind is car. It is typical to think of a car as just a way to get from one place to another faster, but what about the effects of driving. Cars are one of many things that cause pollution, releasing gases that harms our Earth we live on, the very planet that keeps us alive. Limiting car usage could benifit the earth and give you advantages.

""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by  Robert Duffer, the title it self says all, paris has a pollution issue due to the cars that they drive and stated in the article because of  ""near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partical driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Because of the actions Paris had to make it reduce the congestion  in the captial of France by 60 percent, those who didn't follow to what was told ""suffer a 22-euro fine,"" about ""4,000 drivers were fined"" according to Reuters. We shouldn't only resort to cars as transportation, inventions such as the bicycle are still around to this day and the percentage rate of bicycles causing pollution is, zero.

Author Andrew Selsky states in his article, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" that millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during the car-free day."" This day was done so it can encourage people of altervative transportation and reducetion of smog, and according to the article some may say it works. ""It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" Stated by bussiness man, Carlos Arturo Plaza.

The advantages and possiblitys people could have if they limited the usage of vehicles, in Duffers article it is proclaim  that ""parks and sport centers also bloomed through out the city."" The once beated up side walk, is now restored with ""broad, smooth sidewalks,"" and coming back to the congestion, ""rush- hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic."" There possiblities bloom with the upscale of shopping districts and new restraunts increasing.

It is understandable for one to not like the idea of reducing the usage of ones car, but if you sit back and realize it, cars are ""responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emission"" and thats just in Europe. In the United State, there percentage increases to 50 percent. All according to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, In ""German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.""  Beijing, Chine is guilty of being the ""most poplluted cities in the whole world."" Everyone is a culpret when it comes to poplution and that is why everyone should take time to look at the facts and change, help the earth that helps you. Instead of driving your car to work thats just down the street, take a bike, If not take a shuttle. Don't relie on one source of transportation.

The opportunitys that could accore if one just limit the usage of his or hers motor vechile are endless, but it all starts with a choice. Rethink the way you see cars, think about the effect and possiblities that could offend mothernature. The advantages such as building cardio and decreasing of stress and pollution. The time to change the amount of times we use our car is now because limiting the usage of cars is right, and when you give to the planet the planet gives back.                    ",4

The face is an amazing discovery that NASA has made when they went to Mars. The face is just a landform that can have the illusion of a face. The illusion is created by shadows giving the look of eyes, nose, and a mouth.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his MOC team took a picture of the face that gave a much sharper look of it than the first pictures ever taken. That's when they truly discovered that the face was not a alien monument. Later they have got an even better picture. The picture shows is landforms that are like the ones around the American West. The face was like a butte or a mesa.

Pictures proved that the face is nothing more than a illusion created by shadows. The face is a natural land mark that is like some of the ones on earth. The face is not created by aliens. After all who knows if there is such thing as aliens.    ",3
09c8185,"Venus is worth studying because when they study it they called it an ""Evening Star"" also a ""twin"" of earth. It's the closest planet to earth, It is the closest in distence as well. Venus also has a 97% carbon diocide blanket, but on the surface its 800 degrees Fahrenheight. Since the conditions of the planet are like that its way to extreme for humans to live there. Venus is also has the hottest suface temperature in our solar system, even thou Mercury is closest to the sun Venus is till hotter. It has eruputing volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequesnt lightning strikes that happen on the surface of the planet. Scientist think that long ago Venus was like Earth, but even now it still has some of the features that Earth has. It has the rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, craters. NASA is working to keep studying Venus. They have done fom silicon carbide tests that are simulations of the chaos of Venus's surface. One of the things is that they are still striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus. So if there is a way that they are able to go there and get more samples from Venus, then maybe that might tell the scientist what might have been there before and help them out with the previous clues as what happened. They also didn't think about how fast the computers we have today would be. But they also said that just imagine exposing a cell phone, tablet to acid, or heat compatible of a metling tin, that must be what the heat is like on Venus. And since they can't be on Venus just orbiting or hovering safely they can't get the samples that they want from that distance.",2
8a12bfd,"Driverless cars wouldn't properly replace public transportation. There are too many factors to think about. Would they eliminate jobs or be safe for all ages to drive?

I dont believe a driverless taxi system will eliminate the need for people to own their own cars. In this article they dont state if there will be employees riding in the drivers seat or if the public

will be alone in these cars. If they intend to remove the use of taxi drivers that would cause hundreds of people to become unemployed. If the public rides alone in these self driving cars would they enter their destination into the car and pay the machine? The steering wheels on the cars would need some kind of lock on them so the driver doesnt bump into the wheel and drive off of the road. Would these cars be available to everyone or would they be limited to people with a drivers licence. I believe that if they do manufacter self driving cars they shouldnt be used for public transportation. Instead they should have them for personal use.

Driverless cars would be far too complicated to use instead of taxis. They would eliminate taxi drivers jobs and if the technology where to fail whos fault would it be the public driving the cars, the taxi service, or the manufactures?             ",2
e7bdd37,"Decreasing car usage would serve as a benefit to our communities and enviorment. Many countries are already being influenced by the new trend. As proven that without cars we could provide ourselves with cleaner air, physically healthier bodies and a more pleasant social atmosphere.

With the purchase of a car comes the consequences to our only enviorment. In ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", it is shown that ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50% in some car-intesive areas in the United States"". If we started to limit car usage these numbers could drop giving us cleaner air to breathe and a longer lasting enviorment. Some heavily populated cities such as Beijing, China are so polluted that there is a smog covering the entire city. The thick, grey cloud over Beijing is caused primarily by the greenhouse gas emissions from cars and various other pollution sources. Not only is Beijing to be held accountable but also cities in Europe such as Paris. From source 2, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", it is said that ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"", because of the over usage of diesel fuel vehicles Paris had to put a hault to motorists for a few days. If Parisians were not complient with the ban they were fined with 22.

Giving up your vehicle for a day or two may seem like an impossible task but if you were not to have it there would be health benefits. We created the car for a reason, to get places quicker, safer, and more efficiently. Now that we successfully done that and have been doing it for quite some time, we have become much too dependent on them. I'm not saying to completely give up the usage of our beloved vehicles but just become more aware of when and where to we use them. If people used their cars a little less and started walking places, biking, skateboarding, etc. we would have a much healthier community. People wouldn't be so lazy or unfit and it would create a more sociable community.

Limiting car usage would enhance the idea of being social with your friends, family, a neighbor, or anybody for that matter. You could see more people walking down the street as opposed to being inside a car with a limited number of people. It would break down barriers of being afraid if you are walking alone, instead you'd have plenty of around who are mostly aware of their enviorment.

Car usage should be decreased a bit more than it is now for a better community and enviorment. We only have one planet and we should do as much as possible to try and keep it as clean as possible for as long as possible.    ",4
59a00f0,"I as a highschool student disagree with the idea of putting emotional facial recignition in school. Us as a society already have lost a grip on society when it comes to technology. Our youth can't even have a true conversation face to face and struggle expressing emotion or creativity due to technology growth. I think we should have less technology and teach or youth how to ask when they want something, if there bored or confused then they should express that on there own not have a machine do it for them. We should teach our youth the confidence in being able to express feelings not make it easier for our social to be wiped away with this facial recigniton. We already rely on our basic tecnology such as cellphones, and computers to get homework done, cheat, solve the most basic math equations, and as I expressed before take away our ability to be social with our peers. With this facial recignition it will most likely be avaible to most people so in that will might lose almost all social activity in the future if we keep relying on technology to do it all. Instead lets make your be proud and confident in say they don't understand, lets make them understand that theres more then a screen, more then what we type and to see what is around us.

e96eb37,"I believe that driverless cars can potentially change how the world operates and that they can completely revolutionize the world of public and even private transportation. Driverless cars, with the right modifications, adequate moderation, and an alert human capable of taking control of the car in the rare event of a technology failure within the vehicle, can be even more safe than humans driving cars.

In the United States alone, there are numerous occasions in which people have been severely injured or even killed in car crashes that were caused by people who have fallen asleep at the wheel, driving while intoxicated, or tending to other needs while driving. With driverless cars, a vast majority of these examples of car crashes could potentially cease to exist.

In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it states that ""Their (Google's) cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" With the technology that is present in the world, it is possible to develop a car that is truly driverless. Also in the article, it says that ""He (Sergey Brin) envisions a future witha public transportation system where fleets of deverless cars form a public-transport taxi system. The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" Although these cars are not available right now, it is, without a doubt, possible for them to be available to the public in only a matter of time.

Driverless cars are truly ""the future of transportation."" Driverless cars, within a certain number of years, can be available to the population and can be even safer than alert humans driving. Driverless cars truly have the potential to revolutionize the world of transportation.",3
986ba2f,"I firmly believe that technology like this would greatly improve schools all across the nation. Statistics show that students who tend to be more bored or confused in class, dont do so well in school.

The passage stated that ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated with each characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" (D'Alto paragraph 3). That explains how incredibly smart the FACS machine is. If it can recognize the emotions of a painting that was made hundreds of years ago, then it can definetly tell the emotions of the students in todays age.

Another great reason why this machine would be greatly appreciated is because it could improve your daily mood. The passage stated that ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on you screen, a similar might follow. But if you frown, the next add will be different"" (D'Alto paragraph 6). With that statement, it shows that the FACS machine will be able to collect you emotions and then show you something different to improve that current emotion.

So in conclusion, I believe that this technology can greatly improve schools anywhere in the world. If something so small can simply just improve youre mindset, by just scanning you face; it is definetly needed in our schools.",3

3548801,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage helps to cleanse the environment, saves citizens' money, and can help with improving citizens' health.

One advantage to limiting car usage is that it will cleanse the environment. Cars give off a number of gallons of gas each time they're used. These toxic chemicals found in gases pollute the air. Imagine breathing in all of that waste! Studies have actually found evidence that the toxins from car fuel are very harmful to the health of animals, plants, and humans. It can cause breathing difficulties associated with problems in the lungs when inhaled too heavily; as well as it dirties plants and makes it more difficult for them to grow healthy, like they should, and it can even poison and kill the animals. Who wants to take a risk so deadly?

Another advantage to limiting car usage is that it will save citizens' money. Cars aren't cheap. Depending on the make and model of the car, they can cost anywhere from $20,000 to $60,000. Insurance and keeping up with the maintenance of a car also costs a lot. Car owners should be expecting to pay $100-$500 a month for car maintence, and if insurance is required, depending on the state that the car owner lives in, than another additional $100. Finally, is the price for gas. The price for gas in this day in age economy ranges from $3.00-$6.00 per gallon! If a car owner has a long way to drive, but doesn't have a lot of money, he/she may want to consider taking a bus or carpooling with someone to help them out.

A rather more humorous advantage to limiting car usage, is that it could help give citizens a work out. Instead of driving where they need to go, people could walk to their desired destination and burn a ton of calories while doing it! Or in contrast to waiting for a friend to pick them up outside their houses, they could walk to a bus stop and wait for the bus to take them wherever they need to go. This also relates to saving money and helping cleanse the environment. Citizens' will pay less for a gym membership now that they're getting a work out. They'll also be helping the environment by not burning all of those fuel wastes just to get to where they need to go. It's a win-win for everyone!

Of course, there are many advantages to limiting car usage for our citizens, their wallets, and the environment. These three are just a few of the plentiful, conservative ways out there; however, they're all extroardinarily efficient.                          ",4
72d2ec7,"The Face of Mars isn't a face at all! It's just the shadows that gives the eyes, nose and mouth a look. It could be possible for the aliens to create the Face of Mars but it'll take ages for the aliens to perform a task like that. The Face of Mars is only a Natural Landform that has been around Mars since it was created.

The Face of Mars is located in Cydonia in Mars. Since Mars is mostlikely cloudy, the photos were taken when Mars was cloudless and was in open in Cydonia. MGS had took enough pictures during those times when it cloudless. Pictures were taking for many reasons. One of the reasons was for taxpayers. Jim Garvin, a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, wanted this to happen for profit. But, some other reasons were to learn about Mars and it's surroundings for the next ship to travel there.

It really wasn't build by aliens nor any other creature out in space. The Face of Mars was made 25yrs ago. No one knows how it was made but it was located in Cydonia on Mars.

The Face, however, is an illusion using the shadows as the eyes, mouth, and the nose. One day in Sept. 1997, MGS, or Mars Global Surveyor, had landed onto the Red Planet had confirmed it as a natural landform. Not everyone was satisfied since they wanted more proof for this. It was April '98, cloudy time of year on Mars, where people couldn't use their telescopes to see the Face for themselves. So, on April 8th, 2001, MGS gotten close enough for another look. They've took another picture using a better camera that could see anything clear like a airplane, a truck, or a Egyptian-style pyramids! Once they've gotten the picture, People were satisfied.

Aliens never made the Face of Mars and the Face of Mars isn't real at all! It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face. For the conclusion, Cydonia has a natural landform on it that appears itself as a face using the shadows to make the illusion.",3
757bc75,"We need to keep the Electoral College , it has been used by the founding fathers back then and still should be used to this day. The Electoral college is a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It also helps by the process of selection of the electors , were the vote for president and vice president. The Electoral College can keep five hundred and thirty eight electors with two hundred and seventy electoral votes to require the president. For each state has his or her own group of electors chosen by the candidate's political party.

The presidential election is held every four years on a tuesday after the first monday in november. What most states do is have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. Then win the election is over the governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment""with every candidate who ran for president names on it. That means who ever won it represents your state for when you try running for president. The certificate is sent to the congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

For some reason a lot of presidents wanted to get rid of the electoral college such as Richard Nixon , Jimmy Carter ,and Bob Dole. Apparently people would rather have wanted a direct election to the kind we have now. When you use the Electoral College your not just voting for a president your voting for a slate also. Which could also lead to the disaster factor , when everyone has an arguement against the electoral college. Usually the only problem would have to  be a tie in the electoral vote , in case the election would be thrown to the House of representatives were they vote on the president.

The Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner-takes-all system in each state. Candidates don't spend enough time in states they know they probably don't have a chance at winning so they focus only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states. Even though it is unfair it is widely regarded it just tells whoever person got more votes. Did you know when you vote for a president you are actually voting for a slate for electors. So you dont have to always blame the Electoral College its you who is putting the vote into it.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a process not a place that takes in the number of votes for a presidential election. Our founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president. Ever state has thier own Electoral College , and it tells which candidate has won so they can represent are state in the presidential election.

2121299,"Would you like to own a driverless car? Or would you prefer to drive it on your own? A lot of people agree with this idea, and many do not. I personally don't believe that it is safe enough to be behind the wheel of this automobile. A driverless car, in my opinion, shouldn't even be an option in today's society. I disagree with this idea because, people tend to fall asleep and they simply do not pay enough attention to their surroundings.

First of all, many people can hardly handle the simple instructions that they're given to control a car on their own, so what makes Sergey Brin believe that they'll be able to sit back and let a car drive for its self? When a conflict occurs and it's time for the driver to step in and take complete control of the car and they don't do so quick enough, then what? There will be another person lost or wounded due to driving. In paragraph 7 the texts simply states, ""Manufactures are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road."" So, what makes the inventor of this senseless car believe that drivers won't doze off while sitting back and letting a computer drive for hundreds of miles? If the manufactures are implying that they will use cameras to watch what the driver is doing, then they simply do not trust their creation well enough to leave it to do it's job.

Also, many people have lost their lives due to careless drivers. Some people do not pay attention when they're in full control of an automobile, so I strongly doubt that they will come to their senses while a computer is driving for them. If the car makes a mistake it will be on the driver to fix it, but if the driver isn't aware of what is going on then there will be a serious problem. Paying attention to the road is something that many people just cannot seem to do. I find it very outrageous that this car will even be considered to be driven on the streets of the U.S.A.

However, I do understand why some believe that this car will be the car of the future. I mean, who wouldn't want to sit back and relax while a computer does their job? When it comes to homework or something that I'm just not sure about, I leave it to my computer to give me the answers, but when it comes to driving a man made invention such as a car, I'm absolutely against it. If the car can't reverse on it's own, then it is believed to be use less.

In conclusion, I will continue to live by my opinion on prohibiting driverless cars because, people tend to fall asleep and they simply do not pay enough attention to their surroundings. Advising drivers not to purchase these types of vehicles should be strongly proposed. However, I fully understand why someone would want to create an automobile that does just about everything for them.",4
cf176af,"Elisabeth Rosenthal once asked, ""Has America passed peak driving?"", (30) having people go out of their way to think about the inquirable question. There are plenty of advantages of limiting car usage. America, nor any other country on this planet, really need cars. Sure, cars help us to get to a location faster than walking or biking. But it also smogs up the environment we live in and creates a stressful tension within you.

In Source 2, Paris, one of the world's most famous sightseeing locations on this planet, was days of near-record pollution. Paris strictly enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. (10) For almost a week, there was an intensified amount of smog roaming the streets of Paris. Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France. (14) This smog was causing frigid nights and warm days the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. (15) Not only was there smog in Paris, but also rivaled one of the most polluted cities in the world, Beijing, China. Paris decided to particially cut down motorists chances of driving and leave their cars at home or would have had to suffer a fine. This well-known city was car-free for almost an entire week.

In line with Source 2, Source 3 explains multiple ways of transportation. Why drive cars and pollute the air, if there are plenty of other ways to getting to your destination. Bogota, Colombia has set up a program that is set to spread to other countries. This program consist of having a car-free day once a year for the last 3 years, Day Without Cars day. More than 6 million of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses and taxis to work, Bogota's streets were traffic-jam-free.(20) ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman. (24) No stress was within the city of Bogota that day. Their goal is to promote better transportation and reduce smog. (21)

Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, noticed the enthusiastic changes being made and said, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" (26) Fellow citizens, their are several advantages of limiting car usage. Maybe the next time you think about going somwhere, try taking a bike or walking. It's easier and reliefs stress among yourself. Plus, when not driving a car, you're able to decrease the amount of pollution being put into the air.           ",3
f742806,"Cars are usually in most peoples every day lives. We drive them to work, school and many other purpises. Cars have been around for over one hundred years but are people really ready to limit car usage? In a lot of cases around the whole entire world the answer is yes. Their are many reasons to own an autimobile, however their is a lot of reasons not to own an automoile as well.

A main topic now around the globe is the enviornment. Not all cars are going to kill the environment but if you put too many cars in one area it can weakin an environment, this is including cities. Cars can cause a substance called smog which is terrible for the environment or a local residence such as a city or town. As a matter of fact Paris as inforced a partial driving ban to clear the smog of its city. Beijing, China is probrobly one of smogs worst victims. It is known as one of the most polluted citys in the entire world! Sadly, cars are a huge part of the creation of smog. Smog is horrifically bad for the environment for a huge reason, and that reason is not being able to breathe.

Cars take up a lot of space in towns and cities across the entire globe. These areas are packed with roads, that take up many space of the area. Imagin what it would be like with no streets, turnpikes, roads in general. If you did imagine a world without roads you would see nothing but fields, trees, wildlife of every sort. If not wildlife you would see uncrowded cities with buildings that are close and not so hard to get to. People are adopting this idea around the entire world. These cities are easy and very managabel to go through. The environment is unbeleivably clean in these cities and make life in generall less of a hastle. This may not be the way of the future but it is a great idea!

Every car has a bad side to them. Not on the car itself but what it can do to you. Cars make a lot of people angry. How do cars make people angry you might ask? Their is a thing in the car community called traffic. If you drive a car chances are you have been in traffic before. Traffic can cause anger which some people like to call road rage. Sadly a lot of people have lost their lives to road rage by getting into car accidents. Car accidents take the lives of many people in the world. A lot of things can take peoples lives but cars cause some of the most deaths in the world. It is not true that a world withot cars would be more safe but the fact is, cars can be a very dangerouse tool.

People use cars almost everywhere in this world but the question still remains, are people ready to limit car usage? Many people have their opinions about car usage and we may never know the answer to this question. If you think about it we have only been driving cars for a little over one hundred years. Us humans have been living on this earth for thousands of years and have been driving cars for only a little over one hundred. Cars are being more produced now than ever and I think will stay progressing for the future years to come. In reality most people need a car to live their lives. The way things are looking like now, chances are needing a car to live a normal life is going to progress in the folowing years of the future.            ",4
188be60,"The author says that Venus is worth studying despite how dangerous it can be. He uses information he already knows to backup his suggestion. For example, ""Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.""

When the author uses information like this people are going to get interested and they're going to want to know more about venus. He also puts in a lot of detail and he uses other planets to help explain how far away Venus is from the others.

Although the author does talk about why Venus is intersting he also talks about why and how Venus can be dangerous. The author says ""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" This shows that even the author knows its challening to study Venus, but he still insists on studying Venus. He says that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Why does he suggest studying Venus when he knows how dangerous it can be?

The author talks about why astronomers are so fascinated by Venus. ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" explains the author. He supports his idea by telling us how Venus could have once been. For example valleys, mountains, and craters are things that are similar to Earth. He also thinks that Venus can be the nearest option for a planetary visit.

""NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus."" says the author. Researchers can't take any samples of rocks, gas, etc. which is

disadvantage they have. The author says that NASA is working on different ways they can approach Venus in order to study it. Some examples are simplified electronics made of silicon carbide, mechanical computers, etc. They can't use modern computers because they are delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

Even though Studying Venus is such a challenge the author says that it has value. He doesn't think we'll just gain more insight on the planet, he also thinks human curiousity will lead us to many thrilling endeavors. ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" says the author.

is the second plant

from our sun which makes it a little challenging to expoler. but also Venus nickname is a evening star becuase of it bright light points in the night sky. Now why

wouldn't you want to explore Venus?

Venus is Earth twin because of the camparison about how the size and density are the same. also that Venus it the closest to the earth. Venus speed is different from the Earth because of how the Earth, and Mars orbit around the sun sometimes the earth gets more closer to Mars than to venus which causes the speed difference. Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space. So our NASA friends had sent several spaecarfts to land on venus which none of the survived execpt for a few hours or some didn't even make it. but it also makes Venus more interesting to explore the plant and how to make the spacecarft last longer then a few hours.

The NASA sent somes humans to study Venus about their hostile conditions on their surface by hovering or a ship orbiting over Venus. Venus limited the ship to insight the grounds conditions so they wouldn't get rocks, gas, or anthing else from distance. so the scientists are trying to seek conduct mission to understand Venus but there are risk they have to take but they are not go to think of them as risk but challenges.

NASA is working on study Venus by building the ships to last for three weeks or more. so they are looking back at their own old mechanical computers and trying to fix what they did

wrong. They can now build

ships that flexible, powerful, quick, and they can handle the strong physcial conditions down there.

Venus is a challenging plant to explore but who doesn't like a challenge espcially when they came up with more ideas and built better ship to explore Venus. Venus has this curiostiy about it so i dont see why wouldn't want to explore Venus even if there challenges you have to face.",3

The 6 types of basic emotions are also discussed in this article and they're happiness, suprise, anger, disgust fear, and sadness.

Venus is the second planet in the solar system and it's close to Earth and Mercury. Venus is sometimes called the "" Evening Star "" and it's one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. I say we should study one planet per unit in science class. In case a student wants to be in the NASA, they can study bout each planet and they can know whats coming.

In paragraph 2 it states "" Each mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for human to study, despite its proximity to us."" The author is explaining details on why we should study Venus. If anoyone lands on Venus they won't survive much because they won't last more than few hours. Most spacecraft and spaceships need a lot of hours to be able to discover more about Venus.

In paragraph 3 it states "" Venus has

the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even thought Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eruping volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

This states one reaons why spacecraft and spaceships wouldn't last a few hours on Venus. It is very hot their skin can probably melt down very quick or once they touch Venus their spaceship can melt or not work anymore and they won't be able to go back to Earth.

While people are studying about the planet can always find out something new about it. They can find out stuff about the old times or what that planet had long ago, or whats going happen to it, and etc. In paragraph 4 it states that "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely

with ocean and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, moutains, and craters.""

a055628,"I am against the making of driverless cars. Us as human have been driving for quite a while now, and as they say ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Many people bring up the statistics of car crashes and deaths. What they do not see is that almost all of them are because the driver was impared. They could have been drinking, under the influence of a drug, texting, or distracted by some other object. There should not be driverless cars because it is too dangerous with the technology and hacking there is now, it will also cost millions or even billions of dollars,and in a dangerous situation nothing compares to the human mind.

Making these driverless cars is too dangerous because of the technology. Someone could easily get in the cars system and make it crash or break it in general. If a human was driving, that would not happen because he or she would be in control of the car. The car could also get bugs or viruses like an everyday computer does. With all the technology already in it this could make the car stop working completely. Maybe when the car stopped working the driver was coincidentally asleep or not paying attention. Then they would veer of the road injuring them or someone else. Many people would not be comfortable knowing a car is driving itself when someone could get into it and sabotage it. WIth all this fancy technology in these cars, it will not be very cheap.

It is expensive to make cars today with little technology in them, just imagine all the electronics they would have to put in the driverless cars. That would cost these companies a lot which would make these cars even more expensive for the average people. Adding this to the cost of insurance, everyone would be in debt, just for a little more safety. They say these cars have not crashed yet, but eventually some will. When that happens you will just have to buy another one. Only the very wealthy wouldbe able to afford them. Why spend all this money, when we can do it already?

In dangerous driving situations, nothing can compare to the human mind. Computers do not have emotions or reflexes to veer out of the way. If all these cars come to a four-way stop at the same time, who will know when to go first. Also these cars could not compute with all the drving situations there are. Humans do because we have experience. That is something cars cannot have. We made cars and we have learned how to use them well, why change it? We should keep having humans drive cars.

Instead of spending all this money on safer cars, let's just hit the source and fix the drivers. We could spend money on cracking down on drivers under the influence, stopping texting. If you want to spend money on cars, make one that notices when the driver is texting or has been drinking. We should not spend this money in advances insted of fixing the problem. We should not get driverless cars because the technology people can get is too dangerous, this will cost people loads of money that they need somewhere else, and these cars can't do what humans can do.

e9c0c71,"In this essay, I will support my idea that the strange ""Face of Mars"" is just a natural formation. There is not to much evidence leaning either way, but I feel that it leans more twards being natural. We have not landed and investigated it yet. I have some evidence to support my idea. After reading this essay, I am sure that you will understand my point of view.

I belive that the face of mars is natural. First, It is just a large rock formation that could have just occured naturally. Second, There is no other sign of life on mars. Third, It only resembles a face, it is not perfect. It is still controversial because we cannot examin it face to face. We only have the images that the space shuttles took from 1976 through 2001. Just because it is a formation on a different planet, it doesn't mean it was created by aliens.

No. He said that the only intelligent being, with His breath in our lungs, that he created was use. Although, He did say He created the wonders of this universe.

936ac9c,"In '' The challenge of exploring Venus'' the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents that even if there's danger that they should not stop exploring. If they are curious about exploring Venus they should explore it . Even though there is dangers along they way in exploration, if something happens to them, they are at least doing something they love doing.

The author in paragraph 8 says '' but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.'' This reveals that even though they know it's dangerous and people doubt them that they should not go to Venus. That it's human curiosity, if people want to explore it they should because it's something they want to know about. Probably will lead or help us in the future to make this possible for people to go, less dangerous to go as well if they find a way to go.

The knowledge of a human should never be doubt. Venus is a dangerous palce to go because humans aren't able to go and actaully see it for themselves. In the passage it quotes ''However. peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on gorund conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.'' Even though this text from the passage says that it won't be safe there is still a possible chance that humans can. If humans explore it around it would be safe for them, but like catching things on camera it wouldn't be the best quality that they want. The people who want to explore and are wiling to take a risk to figure about about a palnet that most people don't want to explore because of the dangers. That shouldn't stop anyone nor the doubt people say.

Companies like NASA are trying to find ways to find ways to make more explorations to Venus and it make it less dangerous for people who have curiosity . In paragraph 7 the passage says '' NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.'' This supports my reason on why NASA is trying to find ways to get more exploration on Venus. They are also trying to find or make new eletronics for Venus.

In conclusion the author suggest that studying for Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents it's human curiosity. People like NASA are trying to find ways to explore Venus with less danger. The doubt people have about the exploration about Venus does not affect them at all, they are doing something they love to do. Even though there is a lot of dangers while exploring for Venus the people are willing to take the risk to figure out

more information of the planet, and finding ways to help them in the future. Many dangers are found while this exploration but none of these dangers should stop someone, that is willing to risk everything to do something that may lead us to somethiung better.                   ",4
243aba3,"Cars have been used and started to rise since World War II. Vehicles have trended to make them fit our life and culture. But there has been so many tragic events taking place because of the use of cars and people debates whether cars should be used or not. It will be a great idea to limit cars because it will protect the environment, cut difficulties while on the road and improve safety and business.

Initially, it would be a great option to limit cars because it will protect the environment. Cars are used to make it easier to transport places but it does not help protect the world around. Cars cause damage to the whole atmosphere and can harm many. For instance, in Paris, people are fined for driving because of the smog polluted in the air. According to the passage ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals. The use of driving vehicles can make it difficult to live in the world.

Furthermore, limiting the use of cars will be a big advantage to the world because it can cut difficulties while on the road. The less use of cars will lead to better circumstances while on the road. It will be easier for buses or delivery trucks to do their tasks quicker and more efficient. For example, in Bogota, many parks and sports centers have been replaced with smooth sidewalks which cut rush hour situations and traffic. The roads will be wider and more smooth for the environment.

Moreover, it would be a great idea to limit the use of cars because it will improve safety and business. Most instances when cars weren't used in different regions of the world, it led to the improvement of businesses but also better safety. In Vauban, having less placement for cars created more safety for customers to go into their desired place. It also has been more accessible and compact to public transportation. Limiting less cars progresses the world all around.

In conclusion, it will be a huge advantage to limit the use of cars because it will protect the enviormnent, cut difficulties while on the road, and improve businesses and safety. Using less cars will not only protect ourselves but protect the world that we live in.    ",4
7148e04,"Im going to tell you if the facial action coding system is a good or bad idea. First the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vincis masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc.

Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Huang. So computers need to understand that, too.

In conclusion the technology to read peoples facial expressions is a great idea because the computer could help students out if they dont understand the work just by reading there faces.   ",1
778e6fd,"The article about driverless cars makes cars without drivers seem great the only part they did not mention is. What happens if the car bugs out completly and explodes with the driver inside. Since we don't know how much technology will be in them there is no way of knowing if something like this would happen. Other things that seem to good to be true is uses less fuel the car would need to be arrow dinamic and lighter for this.

I think that a driverless car would be good for long trips for incase you fall asleep it will wake you up but also keep the car steady and reduce the risk of a person dieing from falling asleep at the wheel. It would be bad because if the technology needed you to look forward the whole time your driving then it would be a boring trip.

Then there is the problem of whose fault is it if a crash happens a near impossible thing to figure out. The person at the wheel could have taken control and then crashed or the technology could have bugged out and both parties could it was the other's fault. It would be an endless cycle of arguing back and forth.

Inconclusion the driverless cars could be good if they were able to be in control the whole time even if there was anything out of the ordinary. The whole debate about a crash and who's to blame would be constant and niether party would be happy. Just think if you won and the person fixing your car holds a grudge they could mess with your car to get back at you.

The author shows us that Venus is a dangerous place, but that it is worthy of studying because Astronomers have the idea of Venus being the most Earth-like planet in the solar system, Venus is probably the hottest planet on earth, but in the

past it was probably covered by large oceans and various froms of life, just like planet earth. Scientists have the hope of Venus being a place esxplored by humans some day in the future and maybe with new technology that would be possible.

On my point of view, Venus is worthy the studying not only beause it is the closest to Earth but also because when Earth is destroyed by humans Venus can be the new Earth, hopefully humans will change their minds when Earth is destroyed and they won't want the new Earth to be destroyed. If scientists are succesfull in sending humans to study Venus, probably in a future th planet can be saved, it won't be as hot as it is now and it won't be as dangerous. Althought because of the dangerous it is at this point Venus won't be able to get reached and studied.

In conclussion Venus is a dangerous but studying worthy planet that may or may not be explored by humans in a distant future, Venus itself can possibly be discovered with advanced technology, it's surface it too hot for the technology we have now but hopefully Scientist will discover something to explore and get to know earth's twin, who knows maybe in a far away future we may be living in Venus, and hopefully humans will change for good.

Dear state sentor,

Should the president use popular vote to get elected or use Electoral College? That's a tough decision. Honestly, I believe that the government should use popular votes instead of the states votes because not everyone in the one state that the president is trying to win over will vote for him. Also, I think Electoral College is a bad idea because it's too much of a big process.

Electoral College votes are way more complicated then they should be. That's why I believe you should get votes based on every individual instead. For example, if you're trying to win over California but not everyone in that state wants you to rule them, then why make them angry? Everyone has their own opinion I believe. Everyone has their own voice. The people like to be heard.

I also believe that you should just get elected based on popular votes because then everyone will be more interested in voting for you. If more peoples opinions are a matter to you then you're most likely to win. I say this because people who want to rule us, such as yourself, are people who should care. People who like their opinion being heard are people who should be important to a ruler.

So after reading my letter i assume that it had some meaning. I hope you changed your mind about how you want to be elected. Electoral college is a too confusing process and it cannot always be used.

Sincerly, November Nielsen    ",2
baede82,"By learning more about Venus we learn what are the mistakes that we are making. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Because every single time we learn new stuff about Venus, how we can despite the danger of Venus to d not happen again. We have learn that Venus ground is really hot. but

however, peering at Venus from ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate dense, studying Venus is a great idea because we are discovering new ideas. scientists seeking to conduct a thorough misson to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks or maybe we should think of them as challagnes. And it makes scientits to think more, get new ideas many researchers are working on innovations that allow our machines to las long enough. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. for example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of the Venus surface.

Another project is look back to an old technology called mechanical computers, These devices were first envisioned in the 1800. These devices make calculation by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. To study Venus we could make new aireplanes for not touching the ground of Venus. By comparsion systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistan to pressure, heat, and other forces.",2
f92007e,"Dear State Senator , I wrote this letter to you to talk about keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. My opinion on this intriguing subject is that we should keep the Electoral Collge , my reasons being that voting by a popular vote can sometimes go wrong and we avoid the Run-Off Elections. When its time to pick a new president very few people research about this president and his slate of electors , they just vote for the most apealling to them , the one that is always out and doing meetings, or brunches , or just having a perfect day with their family . People that research or dig deep to find out who they are really voting for .

Let me start by saying that the ones whom created the Electoral College , where our founding fathers , these men are thought as wise and caring for their country. The reason stated why the Electoral College should be kept because popular voting can go wrong. Yes the popular vote of the Electoral College its worth but maybe not that much.  In Defense of the Electoral College : Five reasons to keep our depised method of choosing the President , it states that "" But each party...win the national popular vote""(source 3).  Posner is stating that each party picks their electors to be trustworthy , not someone who would do dirty work behind their backs. People go out and vote for our next president and see them running our country , but sometimes people vote for a president for the reasons being that they just want to vote . Its not like the lines outside are not long enough for a person to just go into the voting booth and pick a random president and just leave. People dont actually look behind, search for whom they are votting for .Thats why the Electoral College shouldnt be ruled out , the Electoral College is actually helping out more then we thought. When we least expect it we have a crazy wako running our country , then that would be the time when the people would Notice that they made a huge mistake .

Run-Off elections , sounds like a tedious process. When Run-Off elections occur some people get annoyed , why its a longer process . We get a little bit delayed on finding out on whom the president of the United States is going to be . People want to know who going to be the next president of their country , whos going to try to fix the small little problems the last president left . THose are mainly alll the questions these voters ask. In The Indefensible Electoral College :Why Even the best-laid defenses of the system  are wrong , Bradford states "" At the most basic level...in the ""swing"" states"" (source 2). Bradford claims that the candidates dont spend much time in states that they know wont get plenty of votes. Well true but why would they both of theses candidates are running for president they need to get as many votes they can if they are bad or good . Even though we are technically not being fair with theses states why because the candidiates arent paying so much of the their attention and aren't caring for those states votes . This country runs off on what the people want but sometimes are the people being fair?.

Keeping the Electoral College can be a really good thing do to the fact there are people that do know about choosing a president .It's been stated before that some people dont care at all who the next president is, as lonmg as they fix their problems and they have jobs, and good medicare they are perfectly fine who the president is . The Electoral College is like a helping hand .                      ",4
dac4d02,"Have you ever thought that technogly could see how you feel?

In the article they said that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The scienests also said that according to some new computer software that can recongnize emotions. The people that created this software for the computer is Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science. He made better ways for humans and computers to comminicate. Thomas Huang said that the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major bones in the model move like human mussles.

What did they do to make the Mona Lisa look different? What the have done here

is weighting the different units, this software can make mixed emotions. The new computer software stores simliar anatomical infomation as electronic code. The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intened to bring a smile to your face. Just imagine a computer can tell if your happy or sad, for example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow.

At home are Pc can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode the Mona Lisa's smile. Do you think that in the mirror suggest an emotion? It's all about those muscular action units. The can see the difference between a genunie smile and a forced one. In a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major, a different mussle, the risorius. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.

In the end all we talked about here is that technogly has gone along way to make people happy, sad, and mad. They are making new ways that can show weather you are fake smiling or have a real smile. They also made it to were thet can change the Mona Lisa to not look so mad. So after all the technogly has involed a lot to making people happy, sad, or mad.   ",1
3f0cd78,"If professors were able to read their students emotions through their facial expressions from a computer, it would very well help the students in the long run and the teacher to make improvements. This kind of technology will help students and teachers form a better trust, help make teaching improvements, and learning improvements. A computer able to do that, will be valuable to all teachers and to those who want to better their education.

Even when someone fakes an expression, the zygomatic major and the risorius (facial muscles) will tell so. If a student were to perhaps lie after being confronted for cheating, the computer would be able to read his facial expressions and tell if it is geniune or not. With a computer reading yours and others facial expressions daily, it may help the classroom build a better trust with eachother. The computer will tell their true emotions, even when some try to hide it.

When the professor is teaching something that the students may not understand, they will be confused. Sometimes the teacher is so deep into the learning lesson, they will not realize when some students are not understanding. A computer will help by reading their facial expressions and send a message to the teacher explaining so, then they can realize they either need to slow down or go over it again. This helps the teacher understand the progress of where their students are at and how to better their teaching.

When a subject has caused students to grow bored, the computer will send a message to the teacher and he may make it more interesting, or change it up a bit. Said by Dr. Huang, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communications.."".

Sometimes students will not raise their hand when they have a question or are confused to avoid making themselves look foolish for not knowing. The teacher may take in consideration from the message sent from the computer that he needs call out on those students, getting them more involved. This will help shy students better their learning possibilities.

In conclusion, technology that is able to read facial expressions and tell how that person is feeling will improve all learning schools. The technology helps build a stronger trust, since the technology makes it impossible for people to hide their emotions. It will also value students and teachers, helping improve their learning zones.",4
bb63d9e,"Have you ever though about what I'd be like if you and your fellow friends, neighbors, peers, and family members had a limit on the amount of car usage, and how much that could possibly benefit you later on in life? Think about what type of advantages of limiting something like this. Throughout world today, people have been wondering what is best for their country? Should it be alright to limited on car usage? Ever since the first car was created all those years ago, many people in countries throughout the world have had a strong love affair with cars. But has that love for vechiles stopped? For the most part, cars have always been a major cultural popularity in America, and a large variety of other divrse countries throughout the world, but has that love affair with cars, cooliing down? It's been said time and time again throughout that it has been. If we were to convert into a ""car free"" world would that benefit us in the future years to come?

For the most part, cars have had many positive effects on the enviroment. It has also, had major effects on people throughout the world. Some countries such as Colombia have began to take vital action by banning cars from the road for onwe day out of the year. With only having taxis and buses permitted on all roads. Doing so would promote ""alternative transportation and reduce smog."" During this particular day many of the Colombians decide to hike, bike, skate, and do a variety of other fun activities as well. In the article,""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" -by Andrew Selsky Bogota it states, ""The rain hasn't stopped people from paricipating,"" says Carlos Arturo Plaza stated,""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollutin, "" as he stated while rolling down the street on his two seat, two wheel bicycle with his wife. For the most part, this day has benefitted Colombias enviroment and people darastically throughout the past couple of years, this day has even had more countries join this event. Countries such as Cali and Valledupar have also joined this event. Many believe that doing so has benefitted the Colombians tremendiously, and for the most part, it has. Sports centers, parks, sidewalks, and cities have started to boost up and bloom throughout the cities.

For the most part, the culture of America has shifted shifted time, and time again. But through the past recent years the driving population of american citizens driving cars has decreased darastically. The question has been raised: Will american citizens continue to drive cars, and if so, will this be a positive outcome? In the past years the worlds most common cars that were in usage are known as the Model Tand the Detroit. But over the past couple of years these cars as well as many others have deminished in popularity of ranking.  In the article ""The End of Car Culture""-by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states, "" Different things are conversing which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,"" said Mimi Sheller, who is a sociology professor at Drexel University and theDirector of Moblities Research and Polcy Center. she also states, ""The Internet makes telecommunting possible and allos people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Changes like this could have a darasticallly great effect on people later on. Likewise with all of these changes about car commuting would be decreed darastically.

Overall, throughout the world their has been many changes that have brought on many positive effects. The advantages given to us throughout the years has allowed us to communicate, socialize, and do many other things more then ever before. We have been given many modern conviences that has been a priviledge to all of us. Limiting car usuage would even iumpact us more in the future. I we were to limit ourseleves in the near future on car usage the effects would be of freat influence in the years to come upon us.                                                             ",3
6920fef,"With the information the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" covers, this advancement in technology seems extremely unnecessary and could potentially have negative effects even with the good intentions behind it. As far as what is explained in this article the only benefit to this technology is that computers will know what you are feeling, and the question that needs to be asked is; do we really want them to? Secondly, there was no mention of how much this kind of technology costs or if it would even be plausible for it to be in a classroom setting. Lastly, why is it be necessary for a computer to overtake yet another aspect of a teacher's job of human interaction and communication. Technology being able to read emotional expressions in the classroom sounds wildly ludicrous in terms of use, cost, and personal connections

Although all seems harmless on the forefront of this idea, the side effects could turn very sour very quick. Nick D' Alto says ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" The author of this article talks of how it will improve ad placements by whether you smile or frown, however I know for a fact social medias, especially Facebook, are already basing information on preferable ads by just what material you look at. Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security.

However if this technology was to be used in a classroom, the next question is of course the cost of such a new computer process. All computers would have to have facial recognition in their system and although there is no mention of cost in the article one can imagine that this new technology is not cheap. Is it realistic to expect that schools will pay great amounts of tax payers dollars just so that we can invade the privacy of our children to figure out if they are bored? It seems much more financially sound to not steal the jobs of millions of teachers and let them get to know their students, opposed to scanning their face.

Teachers are necessary in the classroom not only to impart knowledge but also to make those personal connections that tell them how to best teach their kids. Every student is different, learns a different way and reacts differently to every aspect of the classroom. The article says a computer will be able to detect if a student is bored, but teachers have that ability already, minus the cost and invasion of privacy. Teachers are in the classroom so that they can make those personal connections with each student and ensure that they are doing everything they can to provide the best education possible. If a computer detects boredom it will just try another lesson without knowing what is best for the student. So the question that needs to be asked is why would this sort of technology be useful in the classroom?

In conclusion technology that scans your face to read your emotions has too many ethical questions, financial problems, and no personal connections for this computer process to be acceptable in the classroom. Although this advancement is impressive, the classroom setting is most definitely not the right place for this type of computer process.",6
87b148f,"Driverless cars are the future of technology.

I am for the development of driverless cars. I feel that it would make life easy and more simple for people. The combination of todays technology in cars already consists of video cameras, sensors, GPS recievers, bluetooth audio, and more. All of which were made to make driving fun and different each time you would want to go somewhere. I feel that sensors will eventually be the brain of all technology. The article states that the information from sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far more better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

In my opinion, driverless cars would be safer because it wouldn't be the cause of any accidents or harm to pedestrians. GM has already developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger, other options under considersation are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. I also think that driverless cars would interpret driving in such a new way that it would make it both, fun and safe. Automakers have already started on making driverless models; Telsa has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz,Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive by themselves by 2020. The advancement on autonomous cars are already in the works, maybe we'll all own one sooner than we think.",3

But the fact that Venus is close to the Sun make it difficult to be suitable for humans even though the planet is also close to Earth ""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us"".

The issue that ""Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world (venus) and not spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Venus has temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the athospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet. The author gives all of this information in order for us to evalute and understand that Venus have difficulties to be explored and to live in.

But what would happen if our planet one day stop being suitable for human live? Which would be our new home? Scientistics prove that Venus can be sometimes our nearest option for a planetary visit. ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was propably covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" This sentence prove that Venus may not be as dangerous as we think if scientistics give a close look and study the land closely. ""Today Venus has some features that are analogous to those on Earth"".

Despite it dangerous of going and explore Venus land. The author state that is not impossible to go and explore our neighbor planet. NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.

Modern computers are enormously powerful but when it comes to extreme physical conditions they are not very flexible in contrast with old technology. ""Old technology devices..make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all""

Like the author says ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangerous and doubts but should be explanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" So, human curiosity should give a chance to old machines and try to make a second Earth.

b15337d,"In this article called,""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it explains an advanced technology that can identify what humans are feeling on the inside. This technology is attention grabbing and seems so futuristic. The Facial Action Coding System claims to have lots of uses. I think that this new technology could be very useful in a learning environment. The Facial Action Coding System could benefit a classroom setting by being able to tell if the student is completely understanding the material, being able to tell if a student if bored and zoning out, and by seeing if you are enjoying the lesson.

A lot of times students do not understand the information that is being pushed on them and are too afraid to ask questions. Teachers can't read a students mind, and teachers aren't a computerized system to identify if a student is understanding the concepts in class. Students are often too afraid and embarrassed to ask questions in class and for that sake, they just don't do it. From personal experience as a student, this can be frustrating and doesn't benefit my education. The new Facial Action Coding System could change the way people learn on a whole new level by being able to identify confusion, and then breaking down the concepts more. Having a system that can identify if students are confused could be extremely beneficial on lots of different levels.

Students sit through classes for up to 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. That makes me bored just thinking about it. A student is bound to zone out and not to mention get bored throughout the day. It's not wrong to be teaching the material that needs to be taught, but making it a little more interesting could benefit everyone. A system that can detect if a student is getting bored and incorperating more interesting topics into the lesson would be beneficial to everyone. That could make a students life a lot less stressful, and a teachers life a lot easier.

Some students think other topics are more interesting than others. Which is just a matter of opinion, but I found in my years of schooling that it will be a lot easier to learn material if you are enjoying it. I believe that every student has the ability to enjoy learning about something during their years of school. The Facial Coding System could speed up the process of finding interesting topics for a student a lot easier. Sometimes it takes years to find a topic in school that you enjoy, but if we had this new technology available to us, it could help students enjoy what they are learning a lot more.

The Facial Action Coding System has many ways to benefit how we learn. Understanding the material completely, being engaged in the topics, and even enjoying to learn in school. I believe that if we had to ability to do those things, and had that technology in front of us. That there is no reason students wouldn't benefit from it. It could change learning in a whole new way for students. So why wouldn't we give the Facial Action Coding System a try in the classroom?    ",5
f3f00d5,"Even though driverless cars are coming in the near future and have alot of postive and nagative aspects in my opinion I support the devlopement for driverless cars. To convey why Driverless cars are a good thing is becasue is can save alot of time and fossil fuel and is a lot more convient. For instance when the author states that, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and far more flexibity than a bus. This line states how driveless cars can change the world for better and are going to be more aparant then riding the bus.

Some more interesting facts about the smart cars that makes me more support it is when the passage talks about the Driving and the Assisting. For instance author talks about how,""Traffic Jam Assistant."" ""The can handle driving functions at the speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch senseors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" I think this is a good thing becasue it makes driving more alot more safe for the driver, but at the same time does not sacrifice the drivers control of the car and it will alert you if you need to take control of the car, which I think is very important so there won't be any accidents.

To argue why would you need a driverless car if you can just drive yourself is an very improtant question. Driverless Cars can be helpful and can maybe even save your life if you come across some reckless driver on the road. For example when passage states how, Some manufactures hope to do that by bringing in-car entertiainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned of instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not avabilable to drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" This line describes how the driverless Cars have many safety features and can be automatical turned off just in case of emergencys, which makes it even more convenient and alot safer for the driver.

To summerize my argument on selfdriving cars is that I think it's going to be a huge advancement for humanity and will improve our lifestyles for the better. The features in the passage that describes these smart cars such as the heads up dsiplay, which is entiretantment system and information system which, can be turn off automaticaly in case of emergencys. Also the Antilock brake and driver assitance, which can save a lot of lives.

These safety features are going to make driverless cars a sucess. Driverless cars are going to be aparent part for the future and will imporve the way we drive and our action as well and save many lives.  ",3

4ab92e8,"The advantages of limiting car usage result in a healthier environment for you and your children, exercise by walking or riding a bike, and saving money on parking and gas.

Limiting car usage would be beneficial for the environment because the gas wouldn't polute the air. Green house gas emissions from tailpipes polute the air that everyone is breathing. If the car usage was limited, then the air would start to become fresh again. Stated in the passage, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" This exerpt from the passage ""Car-Free Cities"" explains that Europe's percentage is too high and they need to drop it fast or the percentage will grow and the greenhouse gas emissions will increase.

Limiting car usage isn't a big move like most people are making it out to be. Walking to pick up your child from school isn't such a bad thing! It gives you bonding time to spend with them outdoors. You can walk or ride a bike to the park to play. Especially if it is less than 1 mile! Walking is a great way to exercise and its free! FREE!  This component of ""smart planning"" could work if eveyone helped by reducing car use.

Having a car is expensive! You have to pay for gas, which is expensive, and you have to pay to park your car! If you live in the area where you want to go, walk! But if you're going to the grocery store, obviously you would take your car if you're getting a lot at the store. You have to pay to park in the parking garage and that is $40,000 with a house. The passage ""Car-Free Cities,"" states that ""70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move here."" In that town, everything is pretty close to each other so you don't have to drive anywhere. If you needed to go visit a family member in a different city, the the train! It's fun, free, and calming.

As you can see, you don't need to drive a car. Yes, you can drive a car, but why would you? You have buses, and trains, and other ways of transportation. This way, you don't have to pay for gas to go to the park. Not using your car is healthy for the environment and it's great exercise. It's a good way to get outdoors and have a nice walk. So please, just try using your car a little bit less everyday and soon enough, you will rarely use it, the air will be fresh, and you'll be taking some nice strolls in the park with your family.

""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA...(p.6)"" Though, most scientists didn't believe that it was really an alien artifact they still were going to prove that it wasn't an alien artifact. Photographing Cydonia became a new priotity.

When scientists went back to get more pictures they still found the same answer, only more certain. It is not an alien artifact. The pictures they captured only make it more clear that it isn't. ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the firts time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos (p.7)."" After, the new picture was taken, not all were satisfied. So, NASA went back out to Cydonia to capture another shot. This time, each pixel captured 1.56 meters, which is very detailed. There is no way the picture could have been misinterpretted. The Face is just a natural landform.

Opposers say that this information is bona fide evidence. ""Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. ""These people think that NASA is just trying to hide it from them. This is not true. ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars (p. 5)."" If NASA hopes to find life on other planets, why would they hide it? ""But not everyone was satified (p.8)."" NASA has went back to Cydonia three different times, and the thought that it is just a mesa has gotten more certain each time. The ""ten times sharper"" camera proves that is just a natural landform. Some may say that NASA is not trying hard enough to figure it out. ""We don't just pass over the Face very often (p.9)"" ""In fact, it's hard work (p.9)."" As you can tell, targeting Cydonia is not very easy, and NASA still got three shots just to prove them wrong.

The Face is just a natural landform. It is not an alien artifact, and if you don't believe me by now you aren't using logic. NASA worked hard to get the three pictures that reveal the Face. It is a mesa, which is common around Cydonia. Any landform can have shadows that look like a face, this one just happened to be on Mars, where we are looking for life. ",4
dffaf86,"Imagine living in a world were cars do not need drivers for it to move. In this world, there are advancements in new technolgy, less accidents that occur, and people are happy. The driverless cars will potentially provide these. Cars that could drive themselves are very essential to making big advancement in society. When these cars come, they will have the ability to change the world positively.

There are many positive aspects when it comes down to these driverless cars. Firstly, they will provide huge and new advancements in technology. With that being said, there has already been a model of what these cars will have. According to paragraph four, a model car consists of ""... a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera... four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" These advancement will contribut to safer driving. With technology evolving comes better safety and less aqccidents are likely to occur. For example, drunk driving has been a huge cause of deaths. Smarter cars will essentially lessen promblems like that. Also, with more developed sensors, it is palpable that accidents are not prone to happen. These cars are super efficient for people too. The text states, ""The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus."" This will save people time and money. The car advancement is essential.

Some people may argue that these cars bring a negative aspect. They worry that these cars' technolgies could fail and they only feel secure when the car is driven with a human driver in control at all times. They also reason that sensors are nothing new. As a result of people claiming that these cars are unsafe, it has been illegal in most states to even test theses cars. They do not feel comfortable being in a vehicle that drives itself.

These advance cars are surely safe. Others argue that the cars are unsafe and does not allow testing the car; however, how would they know whether the car is safe or not if they have never used it before? The technolgies need to be tested and improved for these cars to be self-driven. According to paragraph five, ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more driving tasks on their own."" Sensors have become more advance to detect and respond so that the cars are safer. For those who argue that they do not feel safe without a human driver in control, the cars are not completely driverless. The car actually notifies the driver when the road requires human skills (""Driverless Cars Are Coming). These cars are built trying to help make it more safe for driving.

These driverless cars are the new advancement. The advancements in technology are becoming more and more incredible. These cars are the next step in creating a better society. They are super efficient and helps provide safety for the people. These driverless cars do bring significant and positive aspects.",4
c9dfa00,"Mysterious Face on Mars

In argumentive situation everyone has there own opinions. But with somethings it makes no sense what they're trying to prove. if i was in an argument with someone who thought there was life on the planet Mars i would try to prove how. In space its hard to say theres life in space because scientist have no proof ,no data, or evidence there could be. For there to be a face on mars is hard to believe and for an alien to make it no evidence adds up.

No one really had an exact reaction to the face because all they were assuming there is life on mars. The public started saying theres aliens up there. But the size of the head was two miles and contiued to stare back at everyone. But some people were realistic saying that their was another Martian mesa they were common around cydonia but this image made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. So none of the scientist put alot of thought into it but its the people who escalted the theory and image.

The people who thought there was life the rock formation of how it looked gave an illusion of a head, nose, eyes,and a mouth. The public was so dedicated to proving there was and they could prove it. But some other people and scientist were explaining that there is no life. The more people started talking and hearing about it became a bit more fake and hard to believe. This theory of the face started becoming in Hollywood flms, books, magazines and just made up stories.

Nasa begun to get frusterated and there budget started decreasing. Nasa actually wished it was acient civilizationon mars instead. Scientist started blieving that the face was alien artifact. So they started photographing Cydonia as i priority. When they started photographing more and more they were sorta getting somewhere. But they finally sent out Mars Global Surveyors and flew obver to Cydonia and they took a picture. The picture was ten times better and sharper than the original photos they had with the viking.

Nasa tried to get alot more photos and were gettiing no where becuase of the main reason the weather. But on April 8, 2001 it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia go a perfect view of the face. Soon Nasa made a conclusion the picture actually looked like the Martian Equivalent. A butte or messa they were landforms common around the American West. Scientist they can finally put an end to the rumor saying theres life over there. Now everyone can know the actual truth with with this whole conspericy.

Getting to an argument with someone about is ther life on mars. Or is there really a face on mars. But i think the argument is clear who would be right. There's just to much evidence proving theres no and what they saw is an illusion of a face. Sometimes you just need proof to an easy fact of what is hard to figure out.",3
ce01b85,"A computer that could detect and read human emotions would benefit every student in the classroom, not just those who are shy or may become confused. A computer such as the one described in the article would allow teachers to better reach their students than previouls before. While restrictions on this technology would be necesary for its implimentation, the software could prove to be invaluable in a classroom setting.

The software in this article can be used to improve the quality of material in a lesson, while not allowing the student to complete an assignment without thinking critically about it. However, a system like the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) could be seen as a means to increase the number of students in a single class. This would not be the case, a resurce such as this would be used as a teaching assitant in the classroom, not a replacement for a teacher. In the article, Dr. Huang suggests, ""...it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" FACS could be used as either a secondary lesson plan if the students in a class cannot comprehend the material or as a studying assistant when the students arrive at home.

A system that could detect when a student is stuggling or bored would allow the the teacher to be more effective when engaging their students. Often times, what happens in a

classroom is students become confused and do not want to ask questions and fall further behind, hindering their learning process. As Dr. Huang predicted ""A classroom compter could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"". A classroom computer such as this ensures a student remains on task, and does not fall behind if they become confused by the material being taught to them. The addition of the computer would be an tool to improve the quality and effectiveness of the teachers lesson.

This technology has numerous applications in the classroom and could be used to more effectively communicate ideas and material while still being limited in its capabilities. Thus creating a safe and more engaging learning environment, catching students who fall through the crack and bringing them up to the same level as those who fully grasp the topic.         ",4
0958685,"I , Luke Bomberger, am a memeber of the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The Saegoing Cowboys help people who were affected by the war.

I believe everyone should join the Seagoing Cowboys program for three reasons.

Not only do you get that warm fuzzy feeling from helping people out, but you also have a once in a lifetime chance to go sightseeing have the time of your life onboard, and explore the most beutiful and amazing places on Earth.

By becoming a Seagoing Cowboy you get to help out the less fortunate explore go sightseeing and have fun.

We help people by bringing them animals from overseas such as horses, cows ,and mules.

When we bring the people the animals it gives you that warm fuzzy feeling of acomplishment.

You should also join because after our missions, we have some time left to go sightseeing in the area.

Some of my favorite things to see were the Panama Canal and ""seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.""

I also had the opportunity to expore much of Europe and China as well as taking a gondola ride in Italy. I also got to take a tour of a castle in Crete. If you think that the fun stops when you climb back aboard for the ride home, think again.

The stables where the animals were kept becomes a baseball field and a volley ball court.

We also have table tenis tournaments as well as boxing and fencing matches.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is fun as well as important.

In conclusion, ""the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy.""

I reccomend becoming a Seagoing Cowboy because not only are you helping the world, but you get to have fun while you do it such as sightseeing and exploring.

I myself have gone on nine trips as a Seagoing Cowboy and loved every second of it.

It also opened up my eyes and ""made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs.""

So,unless you are doing something useful with your life, become a Seagoing Cowboy.

You won't regret it.

005a72e,"I agree that driverless cars are a developing idea. I do like the fact that these cars should be used by the public. They could lead us to a whole other revolutionary idea with the way the human race lives our lives. It could help us all out with our neccessaties. Also it could help us with other sciences in our lives such as medical assisstants and drivers. Next, the ability to drive without a driver could help us alll in the aspect of the way on how we live our lives.

First, for example in the text paragraph 7 it says how the company of BMW has made the ""Trafiic Jam Assisstant"" which could help us drive up to 25 mph without the need to do anything at all. Driverless cars dont just help us at drving it helps us at being smarter. The science put into these cars to drive without any work is fascinating. If we could put that same science in other fields justy as medical, then the possibilites are endless. We could have assisstant doctors getting us tools that we need,when we need them, and alarming us when something is wrong.

Next, these cars are fantastic for elderly people who are unable to drive by themselves. They offer a sugnificant amount of assisstants for them so they dont have to rely on anyone else. Next, it could help keep us safe in our cars. For example, in the article in paragraph 7 it also states that these new cars have developed a drivers seat that ""vibrates"" when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. These cars can reduce the amount of vehicle incidents very much. Not only can they stop us from backing in to something but they can also stop us from being killed.

After that, they have video cameras also in every corner of the car to help the driver sense any danger around them. For Instance, in parapraph 4 they tell of how they have a ""spinning sensor on the roof that uses laser beams to form a constantly updated 3-d model of the car and it's surrounding. They need all of these so it could act as if a human being was in the driver's seat. Further more, these ""newer cars"" dont just give us new abilities, but also the new knowledge. They show us what needs improvement and what doesn't. Also, they help us guide our way to safety if we are lost.

To inculde, these cars could also lead us to anywhere we need. This is very important in case someone gets lost. For example, if someone is lost on a camping trip and is in the wrong spot there and needs assisstance, then there car could lead then to safety and tell them exactly where they are located. It could also serve as a discovery unit. For instance, if someone is in a new town or city then they need to know where the gas station, hotel, restaurant, etc are and there car would take them there. They would help them navigate to whereever there destination might be.

In conclusion, the need for cars that do not need a driver is very important to our everyday lives. They would help navigate, save, and make our lives easier. They would help our economy out tremendoulsy by reducing accidents and the death rate. Next, they would help with people who need it such as elderly and disabled people. Last, these cars are getting closer and closer to becoming a part of our daily lives already, because we have the science that helped us develop these types of cars now.",4
f8491fa,"Schools are full of kids getting their education. Not all of these kids actually care about learning though. Many are only there because they have to be. A new technology called Facial Action Coding System could help lessen the negative attitudes of these types of students. We have the technology to find out how a student feels about the lessons they're receiving. We can figure out what types of lessons interest students the most. This wouldn't fix everything or be the best method for every student but it would definitely be valuable to have this kind of technology.

Every teacher has their own method of teaching and every student learns differently from one another. This shouldn't be changed. However, we can make the students more engaged and interested in their education. This won't work for every student, but it can help with many. Facial Action Coding System is a new software that reads the muscles of the human face to figure out what a person is feeling. This could detect what interests, bores, upsets, and delights students. This would allow the computer to help the teacher to plan lessons that have the most positive effect on the students. The software reads the muscles on the face and uses that to detects what they like or don't like. The software could then alter the lesson plan to make it so that it is in a way that the students would most benefit from. Not every single student will have the same opinion as another or take out the same amount of information from a lesson as another, but this could definitely help teachers to see what works for certain students.

Facial Action Coding System could be a very valuable technology for educating the youth. We have the technology to figure out what does and doesn't work when trying to teach students. Some students wouldn't benefit from the same things as others but this could still be very valuable to the teacher to see what students benefit from a certain type of lesson. This could help many dissengaged students to find interest in their education instead of dozing off in class. ",3
a4ae104,"The author supports the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.so therefore the author was saying its not going to easy by saying despite the dangers.The study of venus is a worthy study because you'll learn things you never knew like venus is referred as earth's twin,venus is also the closest planet to earth.In terms of density and size besides mars.venus has a thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide which blankets venus.Venus also has challeging weather like clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid.

On venus the planets surface tempertures average anywhere from 800 degrees and up fahrenheit.The type of atmosphere the planet have's its not very suitable for spacecraft's to stay for no more than a few hours.That's why the author stated that is has dangers but its very interesting.The conditons that are on venus is far too extreme than any humans encounter on earth.So if can infer that if astronaunts went to venus they wouldn't probaly survive for long.

I don't understand why the scientist keep discussing further visits to venus surface either.Because venus is a so custom planet but like the author states in the passage.Venus is so fascinating to astronomers because it is the most earth like planet in our solar system.The author believes long ago venus probably was covered largely with oceans and could've had supported various forms of life just like earth.I can't really agree on that with the author because of the facts stated about venus.

I think that the national aeronautics and space administration aka (nasa) should overly think about sending astronauts to study venus on a blimp-like vehicles hovering.Around venus because even if all the math and calculations are right you have to think.If the astronaunt scientist can survive more than a hour or 2 will have enough time to get information about the planet.I don't quite think its a good idea cause of what if some exrosion or anything happen.while astronaunt scientist are there.

The mild gas planets average surface temperature is a wapping 800 degrees fahrenheit! there are valcanos, earthquakes, and lighning strikes on a daily basis.

Now although it is very dangerous, there are many pros for study. Being able to fufill the destony of this pioneership will further our curiosity. Also expand the idea of the imagionation and innovation.

85442bc,"There are many positive and negative outcomes that could come from the driverless cars. I believe driverless cars shouldn't be created for public use because they'd be a waste of money and energy. They'd be a waste of money because they aren't really needed to help society progress. They would also be a waste of energy because people are wasting time trying to prefect them when we don't really need them. Driverless cars would also take alot of resouces,like metals and cables, that could be used on more important things that we could actually benefit from. Some car manufacturers could cause more harm to people rather than helping them because they're not fully prefecting the cars and it causes more damage than neccessary. I also believe we shouldn't have driverless cars because people will spend too much time on these cars and changing the driving laws that even if they may think the car will know what to do at every moment if an accident occurs they still won't know who to hold responsible if someone is injured.

If the cars were released to the public then the time it'd take to change the laws would give time for the cars to malfunction even more. They'd also waste time and money trying to make the roads compatable with the cars by using electric wiring instead of the basic roads we use now. Finally I think we shouldn't have these cars because even if they do perfect them then safety will only be provided 90 precent of the time making the chances of an accident higher and they would cause more navagational problems.

But lets get real here; never will there ever be a car that you will never have to pay attention to the road. But if that car comes out then all heck would break loose on the streets. There would be recks everywhere because some people are just so nieve that their just are careless reckless people. No car can ever manage to run by it's own.

The electoral college is a fraud, your supposed to send your personal opinion to vote for the president of your country, not some lazy bum that sits in a chair all year and when time comes to put his vote in he overides yours and the peoples votes for you and not even care because they are getting paid to?

It only takes two hundered and seventiy votes from the electoral college to elect the president when theres over two billon residents in the united states?

6c11596,"Studying Venus has the good and the bad. You find out so much about your planet and others. Like whybdonthey call Venus an ""Evening Star"" when its actually a planet. With Venus being provern a very challenging place to examine, ist hard to find out more abiut it. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite that dangers.

One of the big dangers studying Venus is the temperature. Venus is the hottes planet in our solar system. The planets temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than then on our planet. The conditions are way more extreme then what we've encounter on Earth. In addition to the heat there's erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

We could be living on Venus. Venus has the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus used to be covered with oceans that could've supported various forms of life. Even today Venus has rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus is an opttion for a planetary visit.

There are solutions for the temperature. NASA's solution is to let scientist float above the fray. A vehicle hovering 30 miles above the Venusian landscape. It would be like airplanes flying over storms, but in this case its a blimp-like vehicle flying over the 800 degree surface. The vehicle would be thirty-plus miles above the surface. Solar power would be plentful anc radiation would not exceed Earth levels, survivable but not easy conditions.

Trying to meet the challenge by Venus has value. Human curiosity will most likely lead us to many intimidating endeavors. With the dangers studing Venus, helps us incase we need to move to another planet. Studying Venus is dangerous but, it has its perks.     ",3
599e45f,"The face is simply a landform that ended up looking as if it were a face. If it were to be an actual face, I'm positive that the texture of the rock face wouldn't feel like it is made of rock. The face would decay and what would be left would be nothing but bones. The odds of finding an Egyptian Pharaoh's head on Mars is highly unlikely, or if there's any odds of that even happening at all.

In paragraph one, it states that the face is nearly two miles from end to end. If this were to be an Egyptian Pharaoh's face, it would have to travel all the way from Earth to Mars. How would the face even be put into space in the ancient Egyptian time period? Again, highly unlikely that a face traveled millions of miles through space and appeared on the surface of Mars. Just looking at the picture below paragraph five makes me want to believe that the face is really a face rather than a natural landform. The significant detail and shape of the face is so human like that it's hard to believe that is was naturally created over time. For example, the Washington Monument was hand carved with pick axes and with the use of dynamite. The detail is much more significant than the Mar's face, but yet how nature created it, I don't know and I don't quite understand how this was done. Considering this is two miles big also makes me wonder if this did come from outer space; the face's impact of hitting the crust of Mar's would ruin the structure of the face. The thought also of the face being made by craters hitting the face also doesn't quite make any sense. Could NASA possibly have made this up? People at NASA are very intellectual as they could maybe trick the world into believing that the formation of a human face on Mar's really happened. The odds of it being a natural landform is hard to believe, but also the thought of aliens creating the face is also highly unlikely.

In paragraph two, it states that scientists figured out it was just another Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia, but somehow turned out looking as if it were an ancient Egyptian Pharoah's face. How this happened, nobody knows, but in my opinion, this is just a very odd coincidence. Maybe someone outside of Earth carved this? As people even have believed that aliens were the creators of the masterpiece. Nobody will ever know but it is sure that the face isn't an actual Pharaoh face like people hypothesized it was.

From reading the article, it seems as if NASA used the gossip about the face to try and make money off of the coincidential face that appeared on Mars. At the end of paragraph five, it states that, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" Why might they wish there was an ancient civilzation on Mars? Simply so that NASA's discovery could make them millions of dollars. NASA bringing in the word alien is just dumb in the first place. Are you serious? We haven't even found one thing about aliens existing and you try and tell the public that aliens made this? NASA's purpose of the face in my opinion is for the money.

The idea that the face is bona fide evidence on Mars makes sense, maybe the people on Mars were giants with two miles wide faces? From only seeing pictures, there isn't evidence of anything, we can only state what we believed happened for a face to appear on the crust of Mars surface. As many people believe multiple different hypothesis, we need to do more research to see if there is any faces buried in Mars just like the one we discovered. More evidence that there is possibly life on Mars being similar to the face found would make people really believe that life outside of Earth is possible. We as people could believe that the face is really a Egyptian Pharaoh's face, or a natural landform created by either craters, erosion, or the face possibly being relocated and reaching Mars. As already being stated, we need more evidence of this being a real face. If this is really a face then there would have to be other pieces of the rest of the body somewhere, or more faces in Mars below the surface. The coincidence of a Pharaoh's face appearing on Mars is almost impossible, considering that Pharaohs were people that weren't exactly giants as a two mile wide head would demonstrate. Up close picutres of the face showing if there is possibly more detail than what is shown in the picutres provided would help the fact that this is actually an ancient Egyptian face. There is no way to prove this other than finding other evidence of faces so that this coincidence doesn't seem so much like a coincidence. Being created by aliens would be hard to prove, also using you're common sense that we have yet to find anything even close to the fact that aliens exist. We would first have to prove aliens are real, then somehow prove that aliens came to Mars, carved this face, then left without doing anything else. The chance of aliens carving out this face is also very highly unlikely, in my opinion there is no chance of aliens carving out a human face on Mars. ",4
c83f44f,"I think that this system that they are creating will be useful in the classroom because if a student is confused then the computer can recognize that so that the perticular student may be helped to learn the lesson. In the article it states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. this shows how the syetem can be used for good in a classroom and help kids who may have learning disabillites have an easier time understanding the lesson and learning more.

Another reason that this system can be useful in the classroom is it could make a computer animated faces have more expression so say the lesson the student is learning is online using an animated instructor the system would code the instructors face to have more expression when explaining the lesson leading the the student to learn more aprehensivly. In the Article is says that ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressivefor video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Huang. So computers need to understand that, too."" this shows how it can makes animated faces have more expressions such in Video games, Video surgeries, and classroom lesson.

This essay shows how the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can be useful in a classroom and to better the future of our students and schools.",3
ea87989,"'The development of the smart car""

It probaly seems like a terrific idea of a car that can drive it self i mean who wouldnt want a car that can drive it self when you can just relax in the driver seat?

All though it seems like a great idea for a car to drive it self there are some down falls with the idea it seems perfect but perfect can go all wrong.

The idea of a car that can have a autopilot or can drive it self isnt a bad idea why? because lets say your driving to another state an you dont want to drive for number of hours all you have to do is just switch to autopilot an have the car drive it self seems like a good idea doesnt it? Though it seems like a great idea from google...Did google ever stop an think about the saftey of others? Did google stop an think about safety period?

I feel that the smart car idea an development is a bad idea an kind of a waste of time because all that work of selling cars an making cars is going down the drain I say that because almost 90% of the world population have dreamed about driving a car an getting a car. I dont know about you guys but the story said that the smart car is going to have a camera in the car while its driving it self to watch the driver to see if he or she is prepared to take the wheel at any moment. When I think about that statement I think to myself if theres gonna be a camera in the car watching me to see if im prepared or not shouldnt I just drive the car myself 24/7 365?

The whole smart car idea yes its a great idea but what about getting your permit an you licsense? Im sure on a driving test we wouldnt be able to use our autopilot to park the car. The idea of the car driving it self its actually taking the fun out of learning how to drive learning how to park an other things.

The smart car is a great idea by google but personally I feel that they should just keep that idea to themself because anybody can get in a smart car not knowing how to drive an just turn on the autopilot then when its time for the driver to actuallly try an drive it might end up in a conflict with another pedestrian. Sources say it self that an alert or deffensive driver is the best driver because the driver is aware of traffic. Did google stop an ask if the computers were aware? Probaly not they think that the car is so perfect they probaly didnt stop an think safety.

Google came up with the idea that when the driver should be prepared to take over the car flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays will appear thats a bad idea I say that because what if the lights appear on the dashboard an the driver begans to take over an soon as the lights go away the driver hits another car or a pedestrian?

Dr. Werner Huber said ""why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"" Wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?""

The story also said ""Even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer? Thats a good question an I say that because what if the car does get in a accident who can the other person blame? The driver or the car it self? Im sure that the other person is going to blame the driver because the driver should of been paying attention despite if the car was in autopilot or not.

Another point of mine is what if the sensors of the car go out an you have no idea that the car autopilot doesnt work?

Lets say that the smart car is the number one car in the world that is getting sold so is everyone going to have one? What if other people feel the same way as I do? That the idea of the smart car is a great idea but I want to stick with driving on my own. Is the world going to stop sellingg cars that drivers can malfuction on their own? If so thats a bad idea because not everyone is going to like the idea of the car it takes the fun an the expererince away from driving an learning how to drive.

The smart car might be a great idea for old people because what if they drop something in the car or they might need some type of assistance.

Ive came to the conclusion that the smart car is a great idea but I dont agree with it because it just takes the fun out of learning how to drive it seems safe but wouldnt you want a driver behind the wheel that is alert?",3
b45e862,"I dont think driverless cars should ever be used in the future. I just don't think they're necessary. I think things should stay the way they are, there would be many problems with a driverless car, and would people be able to even afford them?

Yes, driverless cars sound really amazing, but I think the cars we have today will be just fine. With normal cars, there are many crashes. I feel like with driverless cars there would be a problem if somebody gets in a crash, because then they will blame their car and they would be able to get away with something that was actually their fault. Maybe it would be difficult for cops to figure out who did the crash since its a driverless car and many technical difficulties could happen. The article even says that if theres an accident, whos fault will it be? The driver or the manufacturer? With a normal car, it would be obvious who crashed the car and why. The cops won't have as much trouble finding out who crashed. I just don't think driverless cars are necessary at all. We should just keep the normal cars that we have today.

A lot of technical difficulties happen everyday with computers, phones, laptops, and a lot of other technology.

Since it says in the article that the cars would be computer-driven, i feel like a lot of technical difficulties will happen. The car wont always

be perfect and not have problems. What if a technical difficulty happens and the car runs over a pedestrian and kills the person? It could happen with a lot of these driverless cars and maybe the person in the car could become traumitized from seeing the dead pedestrian or become depressed from feeling like it's his/her fault. Also, maybe the car can kill the people inside of it by accidentally running into a tree, a river or lake, a building, and many other things that could seriously injure or kill the people inside of the car. Many technical difficulties could happen, which would make driverless cars not be used anymore. If we dont use them in the future, maybe many lives could be saved. I dont think the driverless car willl be perfect, technical difficulties could definitely happen.

If driverless cars do ever happen, I feel like they would be really expensive. Not many people would be able to afford them. Since a lot of people wouldnt be able to afford them, i dont think many would be bought. So might as well not sell them. Also, I feel like if something from the car breaks on accident in a crash or something, it would be very expensive to replace the broken parts. I think people should just save they're money for something else and not buy these cars. They would be way too expensive.

I dont think driverless cars should be used in the future. Things should just stay the way they are, there would be many problems with a driverless car, and people wouldnt be able to afford them.",4
a34e63d,"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite dangers. Venus is the second planet closest to the sun, and is earth's neighbor. Venus has a very thick atomosphere, and is made up of 97 percent carbon dioxide. This planet can reach tempatures up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists are discussing visits to its surface, but is it safe enough?

No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, its been three decades since a spaceship landed Venus. Conditions on Venus are way worse then here on earth, Venus's environment could crush a submarine, which is capapble of reaching deep into the ocean. Venus's weather is extremely hot, tempatures around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, is still very difficult to survive in, so in Venus there is no chance.

Many scientist observe Venus from a camera that orbits above the planet, but it only provides limited insight, because the atmosphere is very dense. It wil be very expensive to build a machine to land on Venus, just to end up being crushed by this atmosphere. The conditions on Venus makes it uncapable to be studied, and there's no point in studyung it.

The author doesn't support it well.

The author puts in negative ideas into further studying Venus.            ",3

a truck driver whom has to drive home from the truck docking location. well truck drivers work long and painful shifts so this car would be helpful because it could help him get home and he could possibly nap on the way home. Heres another example, when you and your friends want to go out and party friday night, you will always need a designated driver. You preplan where you need to go afterwards, so you cna program the car to take you to 123 apple street. so you guys wont get poulled over for DUI and go to jail. Cars like these are a life saver honestly. This car can be a pain reliever or a life saver. people will disagree with my metohds but these are full-blown facts. If you whine because you have to pay a few extra dollars for something that can help the community then there is something wrong with you. I would rather pay taxes to geto ne of these cars than pay traxes for someone to patrol our city and take drunk drivers to jail for DUI. its a better way to save money. Its fair to say that technology has almost taken over. if it wasnt for technology then we would still be living like cavemen because not one single person would invented the car or the wheel or a farm to do anything.

Ok 1945, world war was over in Europe, and many countries were left in reins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA [ the United Nations relief and rehabilitation administractor].

UNRRA hired seagoing Cowboys to take care of the animals that were shied overseas. Those were the things you would've had to do.

The thing that you want to do is help people out you would have the opportunity to go to Europe and China. It would take about 2 weeks to cross Alantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. So caring for the animals is a nice and helpful thing that would keep you busy. Stalls had to be cleaned out every single day and you have to feed them. Helping out at a farm would prepare you for hard work. You would be very happy in Europe on a cattle boat exspeacally if you are a man. You would get little hurt but not for long. You would play a lot of games like boxing, playing volleyball, basketball and more. It would be a adventure if you are a seagoing cowboy.

24cd9fa,"I agree on the idea of this new technology being valuable in classrooms for students. This technology can help students in class if they are confused or lost. Also this technology can help teachers understand their students more.

This technology can help students if they are lost by reading their facial expression

which then modifies the lesson as a human instructor. in the passage is says "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is bored or lost, Then it could modify the lesson, like a human instructor."" This quote explains how the computer can help you in class by the way you feel or when you don't understand the lesson in class.

Another way this new technology could be great in classes is that it can understand non verbal communication including emotional. like in the passage it says "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" this quote states that this new technology can understand you in many ways, not just in facial expressions but also through both nonverbal and verbal communication.

50c1d54,"Driverless cars are becoming a reality in the world. They are a great way for drivers to relax, and hold conversations on a road trip without worrying about wreaking the car. I believe that the driverless care is a revolutionary idea for the modern age. In my essay I will talk about why the driverless car is a great idea, what are some of the things drivers can do if they get the driverless car, and why I believe that the driverless car is the future of the world.

I believe that the driverless car as a revolutionary idea becasue of how awesome it is. Now that there is a driverless car this could be the opening of a door for other things such as pilotless planes, or driverless boats. This idea can change the way transportation is for the future of the world. Most people would really love the idea of not having to drive unless there is something like a hazard that would require human interaction. This is how I think this idea Is revolutionary.

Secondly I believe that the plan is a great idea. I say this because with the driverless car road trips can become more fun. If a group of friends wants to

travle from Indianapolis to Dallas No one would love to be the driver for that trip.

This idea would mean the driver would only have to drive in an emergency situation like a wreak, or construction. The driver can sit back, and become a passenger like his friends. This is why I believe that the driverless car is a great idea.

Finally, Imagine all of the things that someone could do with a driverless car. Say that someone is late for work, and has not brushed their hair, or brushed their teeth yet, The driverless car can give them the time to do that on the go while not risking being any more late to work. If someone is texting, and driving there would be less wreaks, because the car would be driving itself. This car opens up alot of opprotunities to be the grandfather for future technoligies, like cars that can drive drunk drivers home, or takies that drive themselves. People may say this car is dangerous, and might cause more wreaks. I say that with this car comes more opprotunities for the transportation world to advance one more step foward.

In conclusion,I believe that the driverless car is the next big thing on the market. The driverless car can do alot more than the modern automobile can do. I believe that it is the most revolutionary idea, I believe that it is a good idea, and I believe that it will be the future of transportation. This is what I believe is good about the driverless car.",4

The Dr. Huang relies to work on of psycholoists and Dr. Paul Eckam, the creater of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Dr. Eckman classified six basic emotions suprise, anger, happiness, fear, and sadness. Then he made associated each with charatcteristic movements of the facical muscles.

Dr. Huang smiling broadly "" even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"". Huang using video imagery, new emotion-recognition software tracks these movements in a real face or the painted picture of Mona Lisa. The weighting the diffeent units in the software can be even identify mixed emotions. Even each expression can be compared against the neutral face.

The humans perform the same impressive ""calualtion"" every single day. if we can probably tell our friend how they're feeling because by the way look on there faces. But most of us would have trouble describing each facial.",1
cf4f88f,"Using technology to read student,s emotional expressions some student's are bored some sleeping and some stressing doing the test but the others are happy and working in the test averyone has the percent of the emotional.

taking about Eckman i classified some basic emotions too people now are bored, sleeping, stress, sad, and fear because they want to pass the test and do good this work everyone has something in hi's face.

The facial expressions shows some emotional like happy , anger ect.

every day we have differnt caract or diferent emotional feeling and i don't know how Monna Lisa can be really intended tom bring a smile for us face. i thonk i cant recognize how my best friend feeling is just lokking her eyes cause i know her i and I know when she is happy, sad, bored, confusedand fear, I think people show the feelings but some people can's see because they don't care about it. I think that techonology is a great idea for us or some people who want to know feeling about some people important in their life. I think every emotional has one special moment sometimes are not special but its life and we can't do something abou it. Sonetines we have mixed of emotions like the Monna Lissa. She look happy but at the same time serious. Her smile look like different she can't smile like us. The reson of that is now she is just a painting. Leonardo da Vinci's paint the Monna Lisa but he die that the reason she doens't have the aye browns and thats why she sook serious. That is the reason she look like with different emotional feeling cause she don't have eye browns and she look likr that. we can see the movements in the people face and we can take an idea of how they are or how feeling and emotional are the face show everything. My conclussion is everyone have different emotional but if we want to know their feeling or emotional we need to stay with that person we need to meet the people spend time with him/her we can't say oh I need that techonology to see my wife feeling or my husband felling or a fried I mean is a good techonology but we need to spend time with the person the techonology can't do everything to us. We have the option let the techonology do that for us or do that for people if we really care about his feeling or emotional. For me the better option is the second one meet the people and ask some question to show the special boy or girls they are special for me and i want know more about him.

I like how the techonology work but we need to do the staff for us. ",1
ac28a4b,"Driverless cars? Am i for or against them?. I believe that driverless cars could be fun for some. especially those who are lazy and dont like the complications that occur on the road. So, therefore they'd like someone to take over the wheel for them so that they don't have to deal with the complications of driving the a road that is just confusing and disorganized. Sure, why wouldnt you want a driverless car. But, a driverless car can take som eof the fun out of actually driving for future drivers.

First I am completely against the future of driverless cars because i would like enjoy the fun of driving with my hands. What i mean by that is that i would like to enojoy the feel of turning the wheel at the time i want and also putting my feet onthe breaks as i please instead of using voice comand and telling my car when to stop. To me the idea of driverless cars would seem just a little boring as explained in paragraph 8 when the authors claimed that "" Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for thir turn to drive?"".

Second i am also against the future of drieverless cars becausehow would it have an affect on our lives in the future? How would it show off mankind? not just as a very smart species but a species that is very selfish and has took what was once given to them and changed it into something that has have basically been tooken for granted. I enjoy the cars we have today but what's gonna come next after ""driverless cars"" ?. Are there going to be floating T.v's?

Lastly i am against the futre age of driverless cars because it just cost to much. Some people who have a complete low income can't afford that much money on a car that is worth ober 500,000 dollars. Some of the fellow americans today are considered to still be ""paying"" off there car debt from when they first got the car. Therefore i wouldnt exspect driverless cars to be so big in the future depending on price.

Driverless cars? Am i for for against them? I have explained in the following essay that i am against driverless cars because of the price, enjoyment that it can infict, and the way it has changed the minds of civilians today. I gave three reasons why i am against them and gave details to back up my reasoning. ",4
f10e463,"yes, it is good that they the people that is causeing the damange to the cars pay for they responsibility that they have car insurance so that they can help them with there problems. It is good that have navigation in there car so that they know that they will not have any problems with there destinations, But it is by the law to keep all the passengers safe by them wearing seat belts just in case of any accident.

It will help if every person have on a seat or may get pulled ova by the law so it wont be no tickets going around so that mean by the person skills it would help to make sure that person thats driving is doing what they are suppose to be doing at the time that they are driving.

GM has developed drivers seats that vibrates when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object traffic jam assissant the car handle driving functions at the speed limit of 25 mph but special touch sensrs make sure the drivers keep hold of the wheel. the combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.

The car read the positive and negative polarity as messages in binary code. these smart road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was too expensive to be practical.",1
b6f9938,"The coming of the future is upon us, and as this new era approaches a plethora of innovative ideas come crashing along with it. One of these ideas is the possibilty of driverless cars. As welcoming as this sounds it has not been totally accepted by everyone in society. The reasons driverless cars should become a reality are mainly because they're safer, more efficient, and more convienient for the driver.

The most important reason that driverless cars need to continue to be developed is that they're overall safer than normal human driven cars. One of the cars, manufactured by Google with the aid of Toyota, is equipped with position-estimating sensors, a rotating sensor (LIDAR) , a video camera on the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. A car outfitted with this technology can operate at the skill of a human without making the mental human errors. People argue that technology can't replace humans in every scenario, such as roadblocks or the unexpected stoppage of a car in front of you. Technology has already prepared for this and there are sensors in place to alert the driver when human interaction is needed. These sensors include vibrating seats, flashing windshield lights, and other headsup displays.

Another reason that the devlopment of driverless cars needs to continue is because they're more efficient than ordinary cars. Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, envisions a future with a fleet of driverless cars for a taxi system that would use half the fuel of today's taxis, and would offer much more flexibility than a bus. These innovations would save your wallet from the gas station, and your back from the crowded bus seats.

The final reason that driverless cars should be the way of the future is how convenient they are for the passenger. Driverless cars allow the passenger to talk, phone call, text, eat, etc without putting other drivers at risk. Tesla has even reported that a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time should be released in 2016. Nissan, Audi, and Mercedez-Benz have made similar reports for the year 2020. Who's to say more advancement won't be mad in the ever so near future?

In conclusion the reason that the devlopment of driverless cars is a positive thing is because they will improve the safety of the drivers and the road, they're more efficient for your wallet and your comfort, and they're more convenient than normal cars.",4

But that is not the case now, scientists have been questioning the planet venus our neighbor in space. Trying to figure out the insides of this planet has proven to be quite difficult.

Always seeking to know as much as we can, humans have proven that statement many time. This discovery might just up at the top with some of the best things ever found. Venus a inhospitable planet, making scientists question it. A atmosphere almost made of %100 percent carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid clouds. The planets surface averaging around 800 degrees Fahrenheit and an atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than earths. These conditions are said to be able to crush submarines and liquefy many types of metals. You think this would stop scientists from trying to exsplor this planet, wrong.

They believe that Venus once was like earth. Covered in oceans and supported various life forms. With many failed attempts scientists believe that they will be able to get a unmanned spacecraft down to the surface before it is destroyed by the conditions of the planet. With light not being able to break throught the atmosphere there is no way to take pictures of videos, making it even harder to see. NASA has an idea that instead of going to the surface of the planet they float above it. With a 30 mile long blimp that is maned and would safely sit above the planet and be able to study parts of the planet. ""Not easy conditions but survivable for humans"". Still not being able to get samples for planet they have managed to think of something that might be able to survive the conditions of the planet for 3 weeks. Made of silicon carbide, these electronics have been tested in a chamber simulating venus ""chaos"".

Another project they have been working on is an old World War II device, a mechanical computer. Using only gears and levers and do not require eletronics, ""these have been made to be ""more resistant to pressure, hear, and other forces"".

Scientists believe that this planet has value, mostly human curiosity. This planet has been thought to inhabit life long age and have oceans covering the surface. While the risk might be high, what we might find on this planet might be life changing for the human race.   ",3

Ok so the artical clearly states that Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original vikings photos. When the picture was analized it was proven to be a landform NOT a alien monument. Of course the stuburn ones wanted to believe the opposite,because that's what they do. So they looked again for the the sake of proven the hard to belive ones wrong. They got an even better picture this time, but found more information. The martian is equivalent of butte or mesa which are landforms common in the American West.

e81f535,"Dear Florida state senator,

In few words, the United States should keep the Electoral Collage. Although the people may not depend on them, it does not mean that they are dependable either. The United States may have a long process of voting for a president for the country that in which only they can choose rather than the people, but it still is being done for the good of the countries' future.

The process for gaining a president may be long and not allow the peoples' voices to matter, but the future of the country cannot be placed on their unreliable descisions. Not all of the people are experienced on the ways of the government as the Electoral College or the House of Representatives are. In truth, you may never know that if a certified member of any one of the states is actually on the side for the greater good of the country. An enemy country may pay for any large number of citizens to elect a certain candidate that could be working for them. This could happen with the Electoral Collage. They may be paid by an organization working against the U.S. or by one of the candidates themselves for personal gain. But even if it did happen, as it claims in Source 1, by the Office of the Federal Registar, there would be the House of Representatives to also give the last vote if there were to be a tie. Source 3 states that there is an equal number of electors  which gives every state a chance of getting in the matter of equally electing a candidate for president.

Many things could happen while there is a new president to be elected. As I said before: the Electoral College may be paid to pick one candidate for president over the other. Source 2, by Bradford Plumer, states that the Electoral College has its defenses. Some of its members may be replaced in a state for that states' personal gain in the matter. Even so, it would be hard to tell. For the most part, it is the unfairness of not counting the peoples thoughts and opinions. It is their country as well!

All in all, it is very unreliable to put trust in the people, or anyone, for voting a president. Not many people may like the Electoral College, or their final descision, but even then it is the best way of getting a fair vote on a president. They will be there to select the new future of the country, besides being their job to do so, as opposed to the American people having duties elsewhere. They may want a candidate over the other, but even then by the end of the day, they would be in the same square they were on even before there was to be a new president elected. Even so, if there is a change in their style of living that they frown upon, they can always alert Congress.    ",4
e825381,"In 1976, a spacecraft called Viking 1 was circling around the planet Mars. The Viking 1 was taking pictures of possible landings for Viking 2, but instead it spotted a shadowy human face. Many people belived that it was the Face of an alien artifact while scientists say that it's a landform on Mars. I believe that the Face is a natural landform not a alien artifact.

To begin with, when Viking 1 first took those pictures they were shodowy and quite blurry too. I first thought that it was the Face of a alien artifact, but I then

realized that it was not. It was just another Martian mesa that has unusual shadows around it. It's

a huge rock that resembles to a human head. Of course it's formed by shadows, but the shadows give a illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.

In 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time to snap more pictures. Michael Malin snapped pictures that were 10 times sharper than the original. This time the pictures was less shadowy. The picture was realeased into a website

and it was just a natural landform not a alien monument. In the picture that was taken in 1998 has a better quality, but people belived that it was a cloudy time of that year on the Red planet.

Soon pictures were taken again in 2001. This time the images were new

high-resolution and 3D altimetry which were from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft. The picutres reveals thats it is actaully a mesa! You may argue with me but the picture is a digital image which is 3 times bigger than the pixels size. For example, if there was a small shack on the ground you could see what they were.

Many people had hoped that the original pciture was the Face of an alien artifact, but when NASA said that it was not people argued back with them. NASA tooks pictures of it in 1998 to make people belive that it was just a mesa, but people still didnt belive. So in 2001, NASA took another picture which was digital image and it proved that the image of the Face was just a mesa.",4
f17a1a7,"In 1976 , there was a ""Face"" dicovered on Mars. There is proof that it is there! As of the pictures taken in 1976, 1987, and 2001 .

Many say it has looked like an Egyptian Pharoh. Some agree , and some don't . But whatever it is, it has grabbed the attention of the world !

The Mars ""Face"" Has become a huge pop icon ! In the story it says, it has starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books and magazines, it has even been on radio talk shows ! Something on a whole different planet , has the humans on Earth excited ! Wouldn't it be cool to see it in real life?

Some people think it's Bona fied evidence of life on Mars ! Although , very few scientist have believed that the face was an alien atrifact . That would be a surprise to all of us ! Even though there have been many theroies of to what it might be , we aren't qutie sure. One day , I'm sure there will be more research done for the ""Face"".

NASA has mentioned that even though there are pictures, they actually don't pass the ""Face"" very often . I wonder what it might look lke from different angles of pictures. The pictures have been taken on different occasions , but sometimes the face is hard to find . Also , there have been slight changes, not surprisingly, because the pictures are years apart ! I can't wait until they take more !

What is the pictures actually showing us ? In conclusion , it shows Martain eqivalent to Messa , or Butte . Those are landforms common around the American West . For many people it reminds them of the ""Snake River Plain of Idaho"". What does it remind you of ?             ",2
393f182,"Venus is worthy to pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Venus is refered as the to the ""Evening Star. The nickanme is misleading since Venus is really a plant in our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our Sun.""Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may have beem the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus is often referred as Earth's twin. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Venus seems to be a fairly interesting planet to look into when put into the consideration that it was earth like with its rocky sediment surface, valleys, mountains and craters.

""Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but sirvivable for humans."" If the people on Earth were in a end of the World crisis colonizing Venus would not be bad idea. Since the evidence of past life on Venus is right under the noses of the people of Earth it would be tough but not impossible.

Although the risks for exploring will be tough the real challenge will be to land on venus.""Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions. Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" NASA is working on studying some appoarchs on how to get to venus. ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulation the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" Developing new technology is coming soon and as more time passes the more advanced it going to become and the goal to reach Venu's surface grows closer than ever before.

In conclusion aiming for landing of Venus is worth it, because of the invidence given on the planet. But there is also this hidden curiosity about Venus that can be off putting. Just because Earth may not have the technology right now doesn't mean humans should give up on the thought of exploring Venus. Life, new technology, and new discovery's are waiting on Venus so it is worth all the trouble for one little planet bigger than Earth. It could the people of Earth's future home if something happened with a huge effect on Earth all to together their would be a back plan.   ",3
7264274,"Personally, I believe that there are many advantages to limiting usage of a motor vehicle. There would be less air pollution, quicker public transportation, and more social contact.

Firstly, as stated in almost every article the main goal of stopping people from driving their cars was that their was too much air pollution going on throughout these cities. There was a near-record days of pollution which made some cities in Europe decide the make partial laws to restrict people from using their cars all the time. Personally I think that is a great idea to stop people from driving cars. People not driving cars all the time benefits everyone because the air pollution would eventually be hazardous to everyone leading to casualties and deaths.

Secondly, public transportation would be so much easier to get around with since there is barely traffic around. Could you imagine how easy it would be to get around using the bus or a taxi since there would be no traffic jams or accidents on the road. Of course since basically no one would have the accessability to cars there would be much more public transportation but i doubt it would amount up to how many single cars you see on the road.

Also, one articel stated that, Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" meaning that all this occured due to the dramatic change in everyone driving their cars. I believe that this happened as a social thing because of everyone is always alone in their motor vehicle driving past everyone without a word said, rather than walking past a person with a smile on your face and making face to face contact. Usually the parks and sports centers are getting all these people in there because everyone walking or biking would pass by a park and say that they would want to hang out there for a minute since they hadn't been before or just walk in it to check it out since its on the way.

In Conclusion this is what i think of the advantages of limiting car usage. I think its good for the environment, makes public transportation quicker, and makes people more social.    ",4
0499982,"My position on driverless cars is that I am a against the development of these cars. My three reasons why I don't agree with this is because they don't do all the driving, not all drivers will be paying attiontion, and people won't need to get a lissions or need there permit and it will break the cartural of driving.

The car dosn't drive all by itself you will to take over if there is work zones or if there is accidents. Since it dosn't drive on work zones or by acciedents how would you knowif there is one? What if you sleeping? If your going on a high way and your sleeping on a long road trip and there is an accendent ahead of you or there is work zones you wouldn't possable know and you will be ending up in a accedent.

This leads to my second reason that not all drivers will be paying attintion on the road since the car will be driving by it self they won't no need to be looking at the road. They will be busy on there phone or be sleeping. This will cause alot of increase of accidents if diviers don't payattintion while the car is driving. Also it will increase alot of accidents in teens since they will be on there phone and wouln't care whats going on.

My last reson is that people won't need a permit or a lissions anymore.This could be dangrous. Since the car is going to be doing all the work there isn't a point of passing the permit test if your not taking the wheel, or the lisson test of driving the car because your not going to be driving its the car. This will affect us because we never know the people out there and can't trust them all.

This is why I dissagree in the driverless cars. This will affect us and cause more accidents and people won't be paying atintion.This is why I dont think agree with this.   ",3
da7edab,"Dear State Senator,

I think our country should choose the president by popular vote. So the people get the president they think is the best for the job. But to do this we will need people motivated to go and vote. Because not many people normally go and vote during the election. or any election for that matter.

It will help with the problem of canidates going to a certain state to get the votes. But they can just go to densly populated areas. The flip to that though is they will need to spend more time convincing and/or explaining what they will do in office. Even if we need to find a way to break a tie if a tie happens with popular vote.

The only way to fix the Electoral College vote is not all of one states vote goes to a canidate that way they can't abuse the strategy of going to the states with more votes.

1280d6a,"Participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program is an amzing opportunity for many people. It gives people the opportunity like myself to see amazing places and to help people in need. l have learned more about other countries and I have learned that helping people in need is important. By becoming a Seagoing Cowboy you will also be kept busy by taking care of different animals and if you are a trouble maker this will be perfect for keeping you out of trouble.

One reason you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program is because you will get to tour and see many different places. For example during one of the trips I got to tour an excavated Crete and marveled at the

Panama Canal on my way to China. Also I got to see Europe and China and I was able to see the Acropolis in Greece. I also took a gondola ride in Venice. Being able to tour and visit these different places made me learn more about the world. Another reason you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is that it will keep you busy if you are a trouble maker. You will have to take care of lots of animals by feeding them and giving them water. You will also be kept busy because you will have to pull up bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship and stalls will have to be cleaned. One last reason you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is that you will be opened up to the world. You will be more aware of people of thier countries and thier needs and you will be more caring and grateful.

In Conclusion becoming a Seagoing Cowboy you will have an amazing time and youl will meet lots of new peolpe. You will learn lots of new things and you will be more aware of people in need. Also not only will you be working you will also be able to play games with the other cowboys like baseball and volleyball.                                                                        ",3
6f741db,"Drive or Driverless

Driverless cars are just what the name states, cars without a need to have a driver present. This could be a big part of our futures but whether it will help our future drivers or hurt them is the main importance. Personallly I do not think that driverless cars are going to do more harm than good to our furture drivers.

Today to get your drivers lisence you have to hold a permit for one-hundred eighty days and have to pass a writen test followed by a driving portion of the test with an instructor. These conditions you have to follow to be able to drive a normal car are intense because you are being put onto a road that could potientionally harm another humans life or your own life. The precautions you have to take are endless while driving and the risk you are putting yourself in is immense.

Having driverless cars where you still have to be in control part of the time just causes an even bigger distraction especially for younger, newer drivers. You could be talking and suddenly have to stop manually and not have enough time to make it there, because you were distracted by something else.

Another reason that driverless cars have a negative effect on the future is the economy. To make a normal car cost a lot of money but to make a driverless car would cost twice that or more because of the type of technology you would need to use to make them run proporley.

Having normal cars puts your life into harms way and teens are bad enough when it comes to staying focused, being attentive,and staying cautious with normal cars. By putting teens behind the wheel of cars that uses a computer, or a controling device to run it, is teaching them nothing but pure laziness, not to focus your one hundred percent attention, and to stay alert when it comes to driving.

Driving is a very serious matter that people already abuse laws and regulations for. To give people another excuse to why the accident happened or to why they wrecked into a pole should not come from our local car dealerships and manufacturers. We together as a community need to stop the driving problems directly and not give people more advanced technology, just so they have another excuse as to why an accident occured.   ",3
bc61202,"This is why the face on Mars is just a natural landform and was not created by aliens. How would aliens create a face? Unless, it was their face,I dont think that they could create that. It could've even have been one of their faces. This is my argument on why this face on Mars is just a natural landform and not something created by aliens.

First, in the text it says that when NASA ended up getting a picture people were not satisfied becuase they think that there wasn't enough evidence in that picture becuase it was a cloudy time on Mars. They didn't want people jumping to conclusions so they wanted NASA to send cameras out during the time of year when it was very clear. They thought that since it was cloudy and the picture wasn't too clear they think that there was evidence of alien markings were out there hidden.

Second, when they sent out the cameras on a very clear summer day, it got them a better look but not what some of the people wanted to see. In the picture it showed us that the face looked like the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. If scientists are finding common landforms, it is just more evidence that aliens did not create this realistic looking face.

Thirdly, in the text it also gives us more information to back NASA and other scientists up on this face just being a natural landform. It says that Garvin a scientist states that ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" If the landforms they are finding very similar to the Face on Mars, is showing more characteristics that are extreamly alike, it is most likely just a natural landform.

I can also understand where the people that think aliens made it are coming from. They think oh well since it looks like a face it must be a face. It also says that in the text that the Face on Mars has become a pop icon. It has starred in many things like a Hollywood film. books, magazines, radio talk shows and even , haunted grocery store checkout lined for twenty five years! So with all of that going on I can tell how you would be influenced with the internet and everything.

These are my reasonings on why the Face on Mars in just a natural landform and not something created by aliens. I hope that I got the point across on why it would be a natural landform. With all of the time, reaserch and even money that scientists and NASA have put into this, that you would just believe them becuase actual reaserch and evidnece is more factual then just some magizine or movie film. We dont even have any evidence to prove that aliens are real and that there was even life on Mars, so why would you want to beleive something that a lot of people are very optimistic and skeptical on? That is why I beleive that the Face on Mars is just a natural landorm.",4
fcb138b,"I stand behind the development of driveless cars. I think they could be a great improvement to transportation and commute.

As Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions in the article, there could be a public transportation system composed of driveless taxis that I think would be greatly beneficial as transportation. They would conserve fuel, which is good for the environment, and offer more flexibility for people who need to commute. Plus, if this system is made true as a public transportation system, it might reduce spending for people who use it and normally might spend more paying for fuel for their car, and/or car maintenance. People spend a lot on making sure their cars are working fine; with driveless taxis as a mode of transportation, you wouldn't have to worry about mechanic and/or fuel costs. A driveless taxi system could be dependable enought that you wouldn't even have to learn to drive or get a car, which could save you not only the cost of a car, but also time.

Driveless cars could also reduce accidents. Currently, they're only programmed mainly to assist, and do basic driving, letting a human cut in when there are road or traffic issues and accidents. But, if one day, driveless cars were to be the main mode of transportation, and there were enough of them in circulation within an area, they could reduce accidents in that area with their smart-driving programming. Just assisting, as they mainly do now, is still a great improvement

- they're programmed to drive safely and smartly, and likely would not be the cause or part of an accident. Current traffic laws assume that the only safe cars have human drivers, but I think driveless cars could be entrusted with keeping safety standards for these reasons. After all, it's humans that cause accidents - I don't think driveless cars could be programmed to be so reckless.

Driveless cars are a great innovation. They would be useful and beneficial to so many people, and could reduce many risks that are issues with human driving today.   ",3
f1eec22,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens. It is simply a natural landform. It was just giving the illusion of a real human face. Here are some reasons why.

They thought it would be a good way to engage the public by giving the liiusion of eyes,nose,and mouth. They wanted people to be interested and it worked. On April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and realized it was no alien monument after all. The picture was ten times clearier than the other ones. Skeptics assumed alien markings were hidden by haze. But that's not true. Just like any other landforms it would be hard to see. It's hard work to target cydonia. Whenever they get a chance tot they try to capture it. In 2001 they captured a even better picture. It was like Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shack. But it was really a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. It looks like the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Most peopel didn't believe or want to beieve it. They thought the aliens created it because you could not really see the face. The 1.56 meters,compared to 43 meters per pixel is the best 1976 Viking photo. So whatever they were seeing was an illusion. There's no alien monument on the face so it has to be a landform.

So the Face on Mars was not created by aliens because there's evidence that is a landform. All the pictures saw landform,no alien monument,and everything else was just an illusion. That's why

the Face on Mars was not created by aliens.                                                                                                                                             ",3

A positive aspect of driverless cars is the capability to flexible transportation. ""The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" While there are many methods of transportation in the city, such as trains, buses, taxis, and even Ubers, people still plead for a better method to transportation. Driverless cars will fundamentally provide a way for people to get to their destination safely.

Safety is one of the biggest concerns of America. Many people are injured and killed each year from car accidents. Driverless cars will provide safety to reduce and potentially eliminate car accidents. ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" The developing driverless cars have a positive report on eliminating car wrecks. This information is in favor of road safety.

While driverless cars are in the making, the current ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" is a feature fully available. This is helping the development of driverless cars as a whole. ""The car can hand handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" Improvements in technology are advancing toward driverless cars. With the current model of driverless cars, people can still drive the car in difficult situations if necessary. ""The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day.""

A problem many see arising is the liability charges that could potentially happen if a driverless car makes a mistake. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" As many believe the technology can fail, automakers are solving these problems. ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that problems ahead will be solved."" Many of the problems people are worried about and opposing driverlss cars are in the works of being solved.

Driverless cars can benefit everyone. Better transportation, safety, and convenience are a few of the positive benefits that can make a difference in the world. As technology is advancing, driverless cars are near the future.",4
a73619b,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to cross the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean? Have you ever wondered what dangers could happen while at sea? Have you ever thought about how the work done as a child can benefit how you are as an adult? Well, if any of these questions has even came to your mind than this essay is perfect for you.

Crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans would take a long time but I would say that it is worth it. Luke Bomberger traveled across the Atlantic six-teen times and he crossed the Pacific twice. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program so that you can travel across the oceans too. While onboard a Seagoing Cowboys' ship you can have baseball and volleyball games, you can have ping-pong tournaments (also known as table tennis), fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and playing all sorts of fun games to pass through the days onboard your ship. There are so many advantages to joining the Seagoing Cowboys but if you aren't sure if it will be safe then I will write about the little disadvantages of coming onboard.

So, your wondering about the disadvantages of joining the Seagoing Cowboys? Well, one day Luke Bomberger was working at his job as a night watchman and he had to check on the animals on board every hour. One night Luke slipped on a latter and he cracked his ribs. Luke started sliding toward the edge of the ship where a small strop of metal kept him from flying overboard. So if you think almost plumaging into the deep, dark sea is a disadvantage then there you go. Just because something dangerous ""could"" happen doesn't mean that it should hold you back from doing something that you could enjoy though. If you never try out something than you will never know if you will like it or not, so I suggest joining the Seagoing Cowboys.

Kids are always wondering why they have to do so much work. The reason is so that the work that they do as a child will benefit them while they are older. Luke Bomberger had worked on his aunt Katie's farm as a little boy and it had prepared Luke for hard work to be done at sea. You need to be able to work hard if you are going to join the Seagoing Cowboys than you need to ""work hard at work worth doing"" (quoted from Teddy Rosavelt).

If you like adventure than the Seagoing Cowboys program is perfect for you. Remember that this program isn't just about fun but it is also about working hard. There may be danger while at sea but it's a low chance that the danger will affect you. So join the Seagoing Cowboys and have the time of your life!",3

Say you buy a bike and the only time you use your car is to drive to work and anywhere out-of-state,that means that you'll be able to go a week with roughly two gallons of gas. That puts you at about thirty-eight hundred dollars a year where if you were purchasing four or five gallons a week you'd be spending approximately eleven thousand dollars a year. Thats no chump change. You're insurance would gradually decrease due to safe driving and age so along with gas being cheaper,so would the insurance.

Florida is a state well-known for car crashes due to weather conditions like rain and fog and you can't do anything to change that other than take a different,much safer mode of transportaion such as a bus. Nowadays bus and semi-truck drivers are more experienced and cautius then they used to for one reason,CYB(Cover your Butt).You see major bus and semi-truck companies now that due to the size of their vehicles,if there's ever crash involving one of their autmobiles then they're likely to get blamed cause of the size of the vehicles and so it would make since for them to send their drivers to extensive training and make sure that their trucks are in good hands,which is exactly what they do. Studies show that you're chances of being in a wreck in a bus are one of every one hundred rides while being in a car driven by yourself puts you at a whopping one of ten ridesyur chances of safety are greatly increased.

The United States of America has no shortage of pollution and that's not helped by the fact that we have one of the largest populations of personal automobiles inhabiting this country. There are many other kinds of pollution that occurrs in the land of the free but most of it like factory smoke,large ship(boat)smoke and even resturant made smoke can not really be stopped or diminished by you or me but one form of pollution we can prevent is automobile smoke. In the US up to fifty percent of greenhouse gas is from cars(certain areas).If you stop using you car and ride a bike even thugh it won't seem like muchyou'd be suprised at the difference. Say a sall cmmunity around yur neighborhood gives up their cars that could account for half a percent of greenhouse gas which is more than it seems. Just ask yourself if you want your friends and family growing up in a dying,polluted world.

In conclusion,I'm not discrediting the huge help cars can be in our daily lives I'm just saying if we continue along this car-orientated path,pollution may be what ends our daily lives.    ",4
c7dd9b0,"In paragraph 2 the author states that all the trips to the planet have been unmaned for a good reason the spacecraft didnt last longer than 3 hours thats why it dangerous and hard for us to study the planet. The planet woud be fun to study but almost imposible the temperatures are over 800 degrees fahrenheit that would be imposible for anything to survive on the planet that meaning humans. Venuses atmosphere is also way to dangerous for us to even breath in. The planet is so attracting to NASA because the planet is related in shape in form they belive it could have had oceans and could have supported some form of life. The earth is are closes planet and it know as earths twin. NASA claims that a trip to venus would be possible, hard but survivable. The problem is with the plantes surface being so hot that they would not be able to take samples of rock or gases so what would be the point. They are working on something that would make the spacecraftes last longer in these conditions so they could retrive samples. They have some projects in the works that have lasted 3 weeks in such conditions. the trip to venus with humans going could happen but i dont think it will anytime soon. It could be possible but we will have to wait to find out.",2

0fb0f34,"This story is talking about venus in the challenge trying to exploring it its like its hard trying to exploring it because it got all these things wrong with it like its close to the sun in everybody know if you get to close to the sun your going to die but its really talking about how making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot venus however this nikname is misleading since venus is actually a planent if you didnt know. in our solar system venus is the second planet from our sun. while venus is simple to see from the distant but sfe vantage point of earth is has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. often referred to as earth's ""twin"", venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth,Venus,and Mars, our other planetary neighbor,orbit the sun at different speeds. these differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to Venus. because Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a fwe hours. Maybe this issue explains why not single spaceship ha touched down on venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study despite its proxinity to us. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. ven more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenhit and the atmospheric pressure in 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. ",2
f175389,"Many people wonder what would the future be like? People wonder if they the technology would take over. Or the people would have a system in their home. Or even crazier, having cars that are diverless. During this essay, I will be writing my opinion on driveless car that are not safe for people.

I think that during the future, a lot things are going to change, because technonlolgy is going to take over us. For example , "" In the late 1950s, General Motors created a concerpt care that could run a specail test tracl. The was embedded with

eletrical cable that sent radion signals a receiver on the front end of the car."" This is saying that before the future, and the earlier years, people were starting to build cars for the future. With some old techonology but in the earliers years knew what the furture was going come, with the diverless cars. Since those cars didn't work during the earlies years, they had to make a new . To being to make the cars to be driverless, they were going to need new technology with them. For exmaple, "" Toyora Prius uses postition-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sesnor."" So, all this, is techology and they put it in a car. And I think that is to much to put in the car. The car are going to be car, they are going to show off and talk about what they got inside the car by themself.

Also, we have to think about the safety in people lives. For example, "" They can steer, accelerate, and the brale themselves, but all are designed to nofity the divers when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigationg through work zone and around acciennts."" This is saying that there are certain of things that are made for themseleves but only to alert the driver. I mean if we have cars that are driverless, what would alret the driver when something might happened? There have to be something to alrt the driver, so the driver doesn't crash and hurt themself or their family.

Lastly, the law about drivers would be hard to change because they would have to be certain of age to driver a driverless car. Because in my opinion i think kids, like age 16+ shouldn't drive a driverless car because they could get hurt. "" Still, even if tracfic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the care of an accident."" This is saying that if something happened to the driver, who would cover the accident. And who fault would it be. I think that cars that are driverless shouldn't be allowed because, things might out of hand and maybe, some people would be obessions of buying more and more cars.

In conclusion, I think that driverless cars shouldn't be allow and that people could get hurt easily. And some people wonder how to cover up if they get into a carsh.           ",4

5ab2093,"Would it be awesome if you could read someone's emotion by the look on their face?, You could but most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that can enable computers to identify human emotions. That means this can read emotions correctly. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can identify a person emotion by coding the facial structure is being planned to be used in classroom to read the emotional expression, In my opinion i considered it to be valuable.

First, Everyone is different and reveal different emotions. For example this technology can be used in classroom to read the emotions of students, teachers can identify when students are not paying attention or just bored. This technology will let the teachers know that maybe change plans some fun activities before moving to regain the students attention.

Second, Faces don't lie; If a student had been bullied the technology will show the emotion of that student which will alert the teachers, teachers can talk with the students about whats wrong? or what happend?. Many kids in the world are bullied but they keep their sadness and fear to themselves, even when they show sadness or fear teachers can't tell or understand. The FACS doesn't just take a picture of a face, it constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model move like human muscles.

Third, This technology can have impacts everywhere not just at hospital, or video games. FACS can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery. Teachers can make animation and excites the students to regained attention. Teachers can do animation for the topic they are on to impress the students.

Last but not least, ""why not?"", If the FACS is affordable for schools to obtain, Why not right? It can be used for educational purposes. For example, students can use this for projects or other activites. Instead of schoolwork students can be involve with peers and read eachothers emotion. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, icluding emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang.

In conclusion, I considered this technology (FACS) to have a good impact in classroom, This technology can change the game for teachers and even students.  ",4

02cfa15,"Is it valuable to use a computer scanner to recognize human emotions. The Facial Action Coding System is a computer software creater of Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced science at the Unviersity of Illinois. That can calculate emotions based of all fortity four major muscles from the human face and classified them as six emotions Happiness, surprise , disgust, fear , and saddness.

For many students it'll be a great experience to open up to the science world to learn further more about the human emotions based of your facial muscle. ""The facial experssions for each emotion are universal"" from Dr. Huang.

It's been founded that the great picture of Mona Lisa painting of Lenardo da Vinci. That Mona Lisa in the art was eighty three percent happy, nine percent digusted , six fearful and 2 percent angry. It's interesting for people to know such little detail from a great iconic peice from old history, where the Mona Lisa was really intended to bring smile to us.

This reaches out for students for are open up in the science world learning about the functions of Prof. Thomas Huang computer software. The computer targets risorius and zygomatic if a smile isn't being truthful of ones smile.

genuinely working on your smiles that help you smile more in a better happy mood.

1bbd259,"Is There Really a Face on Mars???

The landform on Mars is simply not a face or supernatural thing. This is just a mesa that has the resemblence of a face. Many say that it's evidence that supernatural beings actually exist on Mars but, there's simply not enough evidence to support that claim. Also it's a landform that can only be caused by natural/ geological changes. The so called 'face' can't be man-made (supernatural).

When picture were taken of the mesa, it was during the winter season on the planet. Also the Viking 1 was only able to take the picture with 43 meters per pixel. When scientist tried to snap the picture again in 1998 it was durin the winter season of the planet also and the camera had to cut through wispy clouds. So in 2001, on a clear summer day, the picure was finally taken. The difference with this photo and the one from 1976 is that the 2001 photo was taken with 1.56 meters per pixel whereas the 1976 picture was taken at 43 meters per pixel.

Now some people may say ' Well how come the 'face' is in that exact spot and it doesn't move ?' To be honest it would be the same as asking ' Why is Mount. Everest in the same spot and never moves ?' Now do you see the logic. The reason those landforms don't move is because the landforms were created by the planet ( Again not man or supernaturally made ).

Ultimalely, through advances in technology and knowledge about relating planets, this isn't a face on Mars. It is considered to be a natural made mesa. With the pictures taken, they had variables of why they looked how they looked, except the 2001 picture. Some cameras weren't as powerful as the pictures that were later taken. Also the conditions were different so it was hard to get a good, clear shot. Believing some conspiracy theorist isn't always the best choice due to the lack of evidence that is provided to support the claim.  ",3
4fc29eb,"Have you ever wanted to travel or see new places that normally others wouldn't have the opportunity to go see? Me, being in the Seagoing Cowboys program reccomend you to join for three reasons. By participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program, you will be able to see unique places that some people might not have the opportunity to do so.

And so to start, I get that some people don't want to go out, or maybe they already travel the world - but, I will promise you, it's worth seeing. Some of the unique places include, well, water! Most of the trips you might be taking is going to be focused on water, and by saying that, I just hope that you may be at least a bit intrested in joining at this point. This will prove, that be joining, you will see new and unique places.

Secondly, another reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because it's loads of fun. Feeding the animals may be a hard task, but it sure frees you form some of the bordom on the boat or ship. Yes, some people don't like animals, and I get that, but it doesn't mean that they won't have even a bit of fun, there's so much more for you to explore if you just look! You can go and kill some time with the animals, and feed them when needed. At night, if you're assigned to the animals, you have to go check on them every hour. It really does seem like alot, but I don't think that anybody would want an animal, or animals, around the ship lurking around, messing up peoples things. This demonstrates that you should join because you're bound to have some fun.

And lastly, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because not many people will get the chance to do all the things that you may be able to do if you just try and give this a chance. People won't, and I respect you. But, with that being said, just stick with me for just a bit, and you'll see why you should join. Some of the things we do you can't do on a normal day. You don't always get to stay up all night to feed and watch animals, and you don't always get to go out into sea for months. This definitly proves that you will be able to try some new things that you normally won't do.

In the seagoing Cowboys program, you'll be able to see new and amazing places, have some fun, and try to do some new things you won't be able to do normally. And with that being said, this shows why you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program., it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportnity - take it!",3
7677c38,"Luke wanted everybody, including himself, to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program beacause he wanted to help the countries that they were going to. He wanted to help the countries recover their food supplies, animals and more. There would be 44 nations that would join up together to help the countries in need that they were going to.

In August 1945, they recived their orders to report to New Orleans. They had 335 horses in the cargo plus enough hay and oats to feed them. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. They were caring for the animals during the crossings. Luke said,""Besides helping the people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.""

You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because there are countries that are in need. What if our countrie didn't have food supplies, or animals, or other things that we need to survive. If we helped their countries when their in need, then they would help our countrie if we were in need. That wouldn't be good if we won't share what we have that they dont have.

If we don't help the countries that are in need, then we might have another war because they would be angry at the countries that have all the things that they don't have. Also what if there were terrible storms that would wipe out all the people that don't have shelter in that countrie. See we have shelter that would protect us from dangerous storms and we also have money to repair what the storm did. But they dont have any money to buy shelter. They also don't have any food to eat, but we do.

In conclusion, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program to help the countries that are in need of. It's not fair if we have something that they don't have and we won't share it. If you don't want to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys progran, then you could also donate some things that you have to the program.            ",3
69d4bd8,"I don't believe that we should keep the Electoral College. Popular vote seems more like the way to vote for a president. Considering there are only 538 electors in the Electoral College, and only 270 votes are required it doesn't seem right that the people don't get to voice their opinion. Also considering the fact that the Electoral College may not be an efficient means of voting because of what happened in the 2000 election. Bradford Plumer states that it was the biggest election crisis in a century. We wouldn't want something like that to happen again.

If we use the popular vote instead there may be less chaos and the system would be more efficient. In the Elecoral College one person could say what is going to happen over thousands of people who may agree or disagree. Which to me doesn't seem like the right choice. The people of the United Sates should have the choice of who should be our next president. We as U.S. citizens have the freedom of speech and the right to vote. The Electoral College is simply unfair to voters,as well as irrational, as Bradford Plumer has stated. But Richard Posner does state that the Electoral College gives political balance to bigger states when it comes to the elections. Though it may benefit in some way it still has its flaws and shouldn't be used in something as big as an election for the president of the United States.             ",3
6de1d9f,"The author who wrote ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" did a wonderful job at suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy job. The author seems very educated and intellectual. The writing also seem very credible. The author backed up their idea by supporting their beliefs well with evidence. The author also provided numerous informations of planet Venus. Not only did they support it with facts, but also with wisdom.

The author started by giving readers information about Venus and how it relates to Earth, our world. The author described Venus as ""Earth's twin."" The author also let the reader know that Venus in the ""closes planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" By doing so, we may feel more connected to Venus since Earth is our home. It chatches our attention because we may feel that we can relate.

After readers get into reading, the author provided more great details about Venus. He described planet Venus conditions and why it is so challenging for scientists to study the ""Evening Star."" According to the author, the ""conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth"" and ""would liquefy many metals."" He also gave a background information on how each ""previous mission was unmanned"" and ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" This illustrates how dangerous Venus is. However, the author turn this negativity into a way to learn mistakes. The author says ""Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus,"" in a way that those factors that may have led to fail previous missions could now be avoided. Mistakes do really teach us lessons.

After the author discussed about the dangers and challenges of Venus, readers may wonder why scientists would even bother to study such a life-less planet. Nonetheless, the author did a great job of backing up the counterclaim. The author argued back the counterclaim by explaining how Venus was once like Earth. It may have been a planet that ""supported various forms of life"" and ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This may give readers hope and maybe change their perspective a little bit.

The author knows best about the dangers of exploring Venus than anyone. However, the author supported why it is still worth studying Venus by backing up with science. He talk about how NASA is working on devices that could stand on the harsh conditions on Venus. He also provided other promising projects NASA are working on such as "" a vehicle hovering over Venus"" that ""would avoid the unfriendly ground condtions by staying up and out of their way."" By doing this so, readers may be more hopeful and trust the author more. This also give the author to look forward to the future and more energy to further study Venus. The author also believe that it may be ""survivable for humans"" even though Venus does not have ""easy conditions."" It is in human nature to fight for survival, so readers may be interested.

The author is not only intellectual, but also very wise. They finished their argument by talking about how it may seem pointless to study such a dark world, but it is not always about science and facts but also it may ""lead us into many equally intimiating endeavors."" The author believe that we can do so much more than what we are given and are restricted of. The author believe that we should go beyond the limit. Never to hold back our curiosity but to let it ""expanded to meet the very edges of imaginaton and innovation.""",5

venus has value not only beacuse its insight to be gained on the planet by itself humans will be curious enough to go check out venus our earth should not be limted beacuse venus can be dangerius annd have doubts but we should expand and to meet imagination and innovation the author thinks that we should explore venus beacuse we could find something great .

6874fe9,"The author supports his idea by describing Venus in a very well way. In the text the author tell us about Venus and he tell us about how Venus could be, He also says that Venus could be just like Earth. Venus is the most dangerous planet because it has very high temperatures, is the hosttest planet but this p[lanet is important at the same time because is our planet sister. What this means is that Venus and Earth look alike but Venus a more Dangerous and it has differences too.

One reason why Venus is dangerous is because is the hottest planet. In the firts paragraph the author says how bright Venus is, he says that is bright because is closets to the sun, and that it also has a nickname. In the text he says '' Venus sometimes called the ''Evening Star'', is one of the brightest points in the night sky.'' This shows us that he is telling how bright Venus is. The author also says that Venus is actually a planet. In the text it says '' In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun.'' This show us that Venus is a planet, and also how he descibe Venus.

Another reason why on how the author describes Venus is that Venus looks just like Earth. In the second paragraph the author says ''Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionlly the closest in distance too.'' This show us how the author is comparing Venus to Earth and also how he describe Venus in a very well way. Venus is a danger because is the closest planets to the sun which means that is very hot and it can burned, and damage person very in a bad way or a person could die because of how hot is Venus. In the text the author says '' Since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.'' This show us that Venus is a hard planet to study because of how hot it is the planet.

In conclusion, Venus has almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide and it has clouds of corrosive acid in the atmosphere. In the text it says '' A trick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.'' This show the danger that is in Venus planet. Venus was a very high temperatures. In the text it says '' On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather than what we experience on our own planets.'' This is show us that a human wouldn't be able to survive in Venus because of the high temperatures. If it 90 times greather then the temperature we experience in our planet then i cannot imagine a human, it would literally kill the person. Venus has the hottest surface of any other planet even tho the closest one to the sun is Mercury. Venusn is also our sister planet.   ",3

It is the only a very sensable and useful step of the progression in technology.

Tomas Edison, inventer of the lightblub, once said, ""I did not fail at creating the lightblub 300 times, I just found out how to not make a lightbulb 300 times.""

I am using this same understanding against this prompt that was given to me through the State Education Deparment.

Even with the possible risks of developing these self-driven cars, there is still a need to do so in order for the progession of development.

There is a general desire for cars, and this desire creates a extremely large billion dollar market.

Understanding that this market is avalible for retail there will be a most unsquiset interest to develop such market.

This neccessity has already been partically filled by our good friends at Google and, unexpectedly, BMW.

However, the inautorable question still remains unanswered.

Is this need justified?

Of course it is justified, espeicially since the job has yet to be asserted correctly and efficiently. There might be copious amount of insidents on the road in conjested areas such as contruction, but someone might just need to fail three hundred times in order to succeed.

These provoking accidents will be an issue, but they are issues in the future in which will be asserted in the future.

0952aee,"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College has been here since the founders of this country put it in our Constitution to please both sides. This Electoral College has made a lot of history in our great nation and we appreciate what it has done for us. It's a huge part of our election process but is time we move on from it. Their have been to many instances where a presidential candidate has had the popular vote but has lost because he didn't have enough electoral votes. ""It happened in 200, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888"" (source 3) This may have not happened more than twice but this could easily happen again and cause a catastrophe. This is why I disapprove of the electoral college.

This process is also unfair to voters because when they vote for a president they are really voting for electors. The elctors can be any citizen so the voters don't know who the electors are. Voters can rarely decide who the electors vote for which puts them at a disadvantage and is an inconvience for the voters. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (source 2).

There has been several of organizations and people who have tried to get the electoral college deleted from election processes including ..."" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO"" (Source 2). These are multiple people with proven track records and are some of many who are ready for change. The electoral college has brought good and bad to our country but there are times when things should be left in the past.

Using the popular vote as the one and only way of electing presidents is needed in this country. The choice of presidents should be soley up to the american people. There should be no electoral college that can totally change the outcome of a election because one candidate doesent have enough electoral votes. In my eyes it appears the electoral college has slightly to much impact on the outcome of the election. Imagine running for president and you when the hearts of the voters with popular votes but happen to lost the election because you didn't have enough electoral votes. How would you feel about the electoral college after that experience? This is why there is a need for change in the electoral college. Save candidates from losing an election that they should have one but didn't becuase they didn't have enough electoral votes.                                          ",4
ca545e0,"The author who is talking all about the planet Venus in this story, is explaining its history and some interesting facts also. Venus is usually called the ""Evening Star"" in paragraph one.

Venus is often reffered to as Earth's ""twin"" on paragraph two. It is also the closest planet to the Earth where 7.6 billion people are today. Each planet orbits the sun in different speeds and when the Earth fully orbits the sun, it is a brand new year! Every time NASA tries to explore Venus with a space prob or something familiar, it would never end up touching the ground of the planet due to a mailfunction with the gravity most of the time.

The author explains that Venus is a popular plant and should be mostly known for being so close to the Earth. Even though NASA has accomplished moon landings, might mean we could accomplish landings on Venus or another planet.",1

""Seagoing Cowboys.""

Like Luke Bomberger he thought it was an amazing program. Seagoing Cowboys take care of live stock that are being shiped to countrys or states. Luke Bomberger was asked to join with his friend Don Reist Luke could not give up this amazing opertunity so he toke it. Luke Bomberger decided to become a Seagoing Cow boy.

The year was 1945 World War ll had just ended in Europe and many outher contries. The army had just sent some Seagoing Cowboys. The Cowboys were sent to help restore food supplies and animals. 44 nations joined together for the UNRRA. The UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys."" Luke and Don signed up to help with rebuilding Europe.

Luke signed up for the trip to go to Greece he turned 18 befroe going there. Besides going to places you would have the benifit of seeing sites such as Acroplis in Greece, or taking the gondola ride in venice Italy, a street with water. A Seagoing Cow boy also has very long trips to get to places somtimes like when Luke toke two weeks to get to the Atlantic Ocean or when it took a month to get to China. Seagoing Cowboys also have to care for thre animals and might run out of food to give them on one of there trips. A Seagoing Cowboys has thre advantages and their disavantages.

Seagoing Cowboys would have to leave their familys behind but they new that they would see them again. Seagoing Cowboys had a lot of fun on the trips that they came back from droping of the animals. They like to play games such as table tennis,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games. The games helped pass time until they got home to see there familys. One night Luke sliped and broke some ribs his crew would not let him work until he healed up. Seagoing Cowboys are like your family that is away from home.

When your part of the crew you have your own little family. When you go to what all the bad things in the world are you want to help them out . When Luke was done created awarness and that stayed with him. Luke hosted a number of internathinal students and exchange students visitors for many years. So go out there to help the people who really need it.   ",3
0674a38,"Driverless cars would not be a smart step forward for us as Americans. Considering the fact the car can not fully function on its own it would be very difficult to deal with. If the car has to ask the driver to take over everytime it can't handle a certain situation, then make one that can and then we can advance into the new era of driverless cars.

The fact that Dr. Werner, a BMW project manager driver, says people would get bored behind the weel of a car controlling itself proves that people would lose focus and that may cause fatalities. When they lose focus because the car is in control and look at their phone, the car may ask them to take over on the drop of a dime, and the driver may panick. Especially if there is an oncoming car and the driverless car can not react fast enough, because it only takes a split second.

Another point I would like to make is when big name companies such as Google market anything they sell simply because of who makes it. If there is a flaw in a cars system then they would be risking a lot of peoples lives, in terms of who buys them. In paragraph eight, it reads that "" Upgrading to existing roads would be too expensive to be practical."" and that means if there is a flaw under the hood, they would lose a lot of money from a bunch or attackers, manufacturers, and their own industry crumbling.

All in all, I believe that it would not be a good way to advance in technology if we're practically selling prototypes. People would be buying driverless cars that aren't state of the art because either it was too pricy or the car itself can not handle the surprises driving may consist of and it would be a major fail on a lot of people's behalf. If we had cars that could fully function safely and accurately on the street, then we could maybe experiment on making the future present. But for now, let us work ot the kinks of the products that affiliate with people's everyday lives or even their lives period.",4
8614f41,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states that Venus is simalar to Earth. But it is very hazardous. However, the author also states that scientists want to study it. The author suggests that studying Venus would be worth the dangers that Venus presents through many ways.

One way is by explaining why studying Venus is worth it. He does so by explaing that Venus might have been once like Earth. He also states that this is why scientists want to study it. In the article, the author says that ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largeley with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.""

another way that that the author suggest studying Venus is worth it, is by using problem and solution. the author lists problems with studying venus, and getting signifigant data. He then presents sloutions to those problems. Then he explains why those solutions are effective.

In conclusion, the author evaluated very well on supporting the idea of studying Venus. He first he establishes the problems with studing venus. Then he explains why it's worth it. Not only that, but he then introduces solutions to the problem.",3
3ffaa28,"Dear Senator:

I think that the Electoral College should be changed to a popular vote. I have many reasons to believe that our system of choosing our president is corrupt. It needs to be layed out more clearly as to how to president should be chosen. It's not fair that some states have more electors than others based on population, we should all get a say as to who should become president.

The Electoral College is layed out in a way that states with a higher populous have more electors in the Electoral College. Even worse than that, if Florida, for example, were to win the Democratic vote for the state, the Democratic party would win all 29 electors. I think that if we should keep the Electoral College that the votes should at least be distributed evenly amongst all of the electors.

In 2000, Gore won more individual votes while Bush won the Electoral College votes. We ended up having a whole fiasco as to who should be elected president for that reason. It'd be alot easier if we had a more direct system of voting for president. The winner-take-all system is what helped Bush win the 2000 election, even though those votes were gained indirectly by a majority rule. It's almost like we don't even have to vote anymore and just let the Electoral College take all of our votes away.

That's why I think that the Electoral College should be changed to a more direct rule of electing the president. About 60% percent of people agree that we should change our system of electing the president. I hope to see the Electoral College changed.    ",3
803153e,"Driverless cars are becoming popular. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of the driverless car. The negative aspects of the driverless car are stronger than the positvie aspects. Some of the negative aspects of the driverless car consist of: the amount of money/modifications needed, having to stay alert at all times in the passenger seat, and waiting on the law.

In the article, the author asks the reader a question. He asks, ""How much smarter did the cars need to be?"" He answers his own question in the reading. He mentions that the cars needed a whole lot of sensors. They needed sensors for the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. There are many modifications that needed to be made to the cars to make them smarter. Along with the modifications comes with the expense of the equipment. None of that equipment had to be cheap. In this case, The amount of equipment is a negative becasue of how much the cars need.

Another negative is that there always needs to be an alert driver in the passenger seat of the car at all times. In the article, the author says, ""The car can handle driving functions at the speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This makes the driveless car seem less important. Also, the author mentions that the cars can steer, accelerate, and brake on their own but they are designed to notify the driver when the roads require human skills. This means that the driver has to stay alert and be ready to take over when they are needed. Because the car isn't fully driverless, the manufacturers have to make the driving fun in a new way. They have to use heads-up displays that can be turned off when the driver needs to take over.

For the driverless cars to be legal, we have to wait on the law to be passed. Many of the driving laws focus on keeping the drivers, the passengers, and the pedestrians safe. Safety is best achieved with an alert driver. The assumption is that a human driver is the most affective and alert driver. As a result, the only states that allow computer-driven cars to be tested are California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. Even though the cars have been proved to be more reliably safe, traffic laws will need to be changed along with liability laws that will need to be established in case of an accident. This reason is a negative one against the development of driverless cars.

Though there are many positive reasons for the development of the driverless car, the negative aspects outrule and over power the positive ones making the driverless car a hassle to develop by the amount of money/modifications needed for the cars, always having to stay alert in the passenger seat, and the wait for the legalization of the driving of the driverless cars.",4
16f205a,"I suggest to try the Seagoing Cowboys program based on the information and the passage I have read. It can help you learn and experience things you have probably never done before. Also you could go places you have never been before and probably would like to.

A reason to join the Seagoing Cowboys program is to learn and experience new things. If participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program it makes you realize and make you more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

Secondly, playing games on trips like baseball and volleyball can also be fun. Also table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, whittling, and games also helped pass time. At last, being a Seagoing Cowboy can be more than just an adventure.

It can open up a new world.

As I see it, joining the Seagoing Cowboys program can be an opportunity of a lifetime to travel on a cattle boat and help people from a different country.    ",2
7f7af36,"The possibility of technological error and the necessity of modifying the law are among several issues that we face with driverless cars; therefore, driverless cars may not be the most ideal solution to safer roads. Although I believe that updates can be added to enhance safety features and prevent reckless driving, I think that the concept of having driverless cars to such an extent is dangerous.

Technological error is certainly the most significant of the negative aspects that driverless cars present to humans. Driverless cars have their faults just as humans do, and the benefits that these cars provide are often outweighed by error.

According to paragraph 9, ""technology fails,"" and when that occurs, ""someone is injured."" Another perspective on this topic is human reliance on technology. Even though people can be alerted when something is wrong, not everyone will pay attention to those warnings. They may take advantage of the fact that the car drives by itself, which could lead to dozing off or even to drinking behind the wheel. Humans also couldn't develop motor skills as well. Alertness could decrease because some people may believe that they won't have to be aware of their surroundings while in the car. In addition, coordination and perception could be effected because people may not feel the need to improve on those skills since the car is driving instead. Paragraph 9 states, ""lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" This applies to driverless cars in that it implies that some may become lazy and unattentive while in an advanced car.

Laws may have to change drastically also, and it may be difficult for many people to keep up with the modifications. This could mean that countless people will have little knowledge of the rules of the road. In the article, it is brought up that ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" Contrary to this, driverless car owners may feel that it is unnessary to learn traffic laws because the car itself will be driving. Ignorance results from that way of thinking, and ignorance can lead to unsafe driving conditions and reckless driving. Besides traffic laws, various other laws will need to be upgraded or invented as well. The article mentions that ""new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" In other words, it would be necessary to create laws that distinguish between driver and manufacturer fault. It would be difficult to determine who exactly was the cause of an accident, which means that there could be many aggressive cases between owners and manufacturers.

In conclusion, driverless cars wouldn't exactly be for the benefit of the world. Their abilities are extraordinary, but it is not to be forgotten that with technology comes error. Driver awareness is essential to safe roads, and unfortunately driverless cars can cause less driver alertness as humans begin to rely soley on technology to assist them in their everyday lives.

bb69863,"The Electoral College should be abolished because citizens can't vote directly on which canidate they want. The electoral college is unfair because a candiate that wins the vote of the people, they can't become president if they don't have enough electoral votes. For example when Al Gore was elected, Gore won the popular vote but could not become president because of insufficent electoral college votes.

It is not fair to the people that their vote cannot count unless it goes through the Electoral College. The Electoral College bases on what the overall state vote is, instead of the individual voter, thus making it unfair to each voter if they do not get an equal say in who they want as president. Said in source two, ""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" The citizens should be able to choose who governs their country. Direct elections are much easier than having an Electoral College. The voters vote, the majority wins and we have a new president.

In the Electoral College system, the voters vote of another set of voters who vote for the candiate of their party. The Electoral College way is much more difficult than having a popular vote method of voting.

In some cases,when no candiate wins a majority of the popular vote, in source 3, ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college(301 and 370 Electoral votes, respectively).""  This could be a clearer solution to havings run-off elections. Also in source 3, ""There is no pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the voters cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidentail election process, is reduced by the Electoral Collage, which invariably produces a clear winner."" The president should be choosen by what the people want. There are also some citizens who may be a republican in a democratic state and vice versa who's vote wouldn't even be considered because the Electoral College will be voting for the overall states vote. In a popular vote everyone gets a say in who our president will be.

Having the popular vote method is a way to give all citizens a voice in who they want their next president to be. It's also a way to get people involved with government. If everyone gets an equal say,Then the president is choosen fairly among the citizens instead of a group of electors that go by the states overall vote rather than everyone getting equality. After all, America is a democracy and the electoral college isn't very democratic.    ",4

We do not need technology that can tell us student's emotions in a classroom, it would not make the world a better place.

The use of technology telling us student's emotion is useless, we do not need this in our world. We can easily use cameras to watch each student's reaction or emotion in a classroom, we abousloy should not spend billions of dollars on technology like that. The author states "" your orbicularis oris tightens your lips to show anger"", that is not a fact at all. Many people are able to to get angry without tightening their lips, they are able to hide their anger. The author also states that they have trouble describing each emotion, which means people could get confused if they are trying to read other people's emotion.

We should not spend billions of dollars on this type of technology, it is not useful to us. It will not make our lives easier, it would only complicate it our lives. We should be putting our time and money on technology that we do need such as making drinkable water or cars that do not use fuel. Those are technology that we do need.

743acd8,"I feel that keeping the Electoral College is the wrong way to go. That changing it to election by popular vote is a better decision. Because the people of our nation should be able to choose who they want to be the president not the 538 electors. Why not have the whole nation vote for who they want and who ever has the majority of the votes win? That sounds like a fair election to me! The electoral college has so many faults, that just one little tiny mishap can cause a huge disater within the election.

The electoral college does have some advantages. Like swing states, or avoiding run-off elections . But it also has disadvantages for example it takes so many risks, its unfair to voters, its outdated, and irrational.

The electoral college cheats the people who are voting. I mean they didn't sign up or vote for the electors

NO, they did it for the president. So why not give them that chance? It makes it easier on other people and the election is a fair one.

The picking and choosing of the electors is unorganized. Each year its a different person.

Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the states party's central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates themselves.

Voters that go and vote for which ever president they want, really aren't even voting for the president their voting for that president's elector. Which is someone who goes and votes for that president that picked them as their elector. And sometimes the voter that is actually voting for the elector to vote for their assigned president will end up voting for a different president. Also voters will sometimes get confused about all these electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

So in conclusion, changing from Electoral College would be the best choice to make. Because election by popular vote for the president isn't so complicated, is more reliable, isn't so risky, and most importantly the voters get a fair election.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ",3
03e804e,"Car free cities, in German suburb life goes on without cars. The residents of the community have given up their cars.  Street parkings and driveways are forbidden in the new district near the French and swiss borders. the streets are completely empty except for the main thoroughfare and a few streets on the edge of the community. In addition, 70% of vaubans families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move there. A growing trend going around they say they want to seperate them from auto use, a saying called ""smart planning"". the efforts that they put in that some people build their own houses to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions from tailpipes. In Europe they are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United states.

In conclusion, there have been effortsain the past two decades to make the cities more dense, and better for walking. Home to 5,500 residents within a square mile, this may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. above all this, stores are placed on about a walk away, on a main street rather then along some distant highway. According to them how much you drive is as important as weather you have a hybrid. Suburbs will spread out the homes were thwe dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. in the developing world where they will increase number of private cars ownd by the middle class. In the United states, the enviromental protection agency is promoting car reduced communities, and legistlators are starting to act cautiously. many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role.

Above all of this paris bans driving due to smog. days after near record pollution they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or get charged with a 31$ fine. the same thing would apply tot he odd numbers the following day. about almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to the reuters, and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. it was down by 605 in the capital of France, after a five days of horrible smog, it rivaled that Beijing, china, which was known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. The cold air and warm days would cause the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Deisels make up to 67% of vehicles in france, campared to 53.3% rest of Western Europe, according to reuters. Paris has more smog then any other European capitals. paris had 147 per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in london, reuters found.

Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while eceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. In a program thats set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked skated or took buses to work during a car free day. It was the third year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital of 7 million. the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. violaters faced 25$ fines. It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution they said.

9af7672,In this article they say the dangers of going on venus. they make it to where it is suitable for people to go on they make it to where theyre standing and floating 30 miles in the air . the pressure makes it harder for it to be liveable and the heat . They say its like taking an electronic on a machine chamber and letting it go and get heated and melt. venus has the hottest surface tempeture of any planet because its closer to the sun.they orbit the sun at different speeds which is why density is so high on venus. Humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on venus. it didnt seem to work out but they sent humans there and tried to make it live able for them . The humans studied the planet and tried to get it to where it is most comfortable for people to go. they cant send electro devices because it will only damage them. They put them 30 miles in the air so that they wont feel the heat and presure against their bodies. this is the best suitable way for them to make it on the planet venus.,1
d4014ec,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author explaines all the dangers of Venus and how to over come them. He gives you good evidence on how you could explore our sister planet without suffering the harsh weather of Venus's surface. Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, and it may have even had large oceans long ago, but today Venus's surface is inhospitable for humans.

The author states that ""Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Venus is no longer Earth-like, its surface temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times the pressure we experiance on Earth. And with that, there are many other factors making Venus inhabitable for humans. The author did offer a solution to these dangers, which would allow the scientists to float above the dangers. NASA said they would take a ""...blimp-like vehical [that hovers] 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" It would make the conditions survivable for humans, but how much research could you do on the planet when you're 30 miles above the surface? The author goes on and writes that researchers are working on machines that could possibly go in the ground of Venus and collect data about the surface,and could return it to the scientists for them to study.

The author of

""The Challenges of Exploring Venus,"" supports their idea that studying Venus is worth the risks. They take in account all the dangers Venus has to offer, and they come up with a solution that would make the planet explorable.                        ",3
cca1cb3,"The way Luke see's the trip is amazing, but there is more to than that. Joing the Seagoing Cowboys program is not only about seeing new places, but its about helping the people and doing as much as you possibly can to help. There is also many ways that this can benfit you. You can learn new languages and taste new foods. This isn't only about the amzing site that you see, but it can also be a nice learing experince. This also let you help people in need. Such as if there was a earthquake or flood. you can help them rebulid everything they had.

It would be a good i dea for more people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because not only do you get to help people rebulid there life, but you get to see amazing places such as Italy, Europe, China, and so many more beautiful sites. joining can also teach you how to speak different languages, live on boat, become closer to animals, see things you have never seen before. This could be an amazing adventure and you could have great stories to tell the family. Not only would this be a great adventure, but it has so many benefits that you probably haven't thought about. Joing the Seagoing Cowboys program would help you so much in ways that can change your life forever.

In the passage Luke mainly talk about how this changed his life because of the amazing places he went to. When readers read this they would automatically think that that is all there is to it, but is isn't that it about helping people rebuild everything they lost and will never see again. Luke talks about how he he was so happy to be with animals on aboat seeing someof the most unforgetable places ever, but what he dosen't say is that these people need more

Seagoing Cowboys. Without Seagoing Cowboys so many people would not have a home, fresh clothes, warm food, or food at all. Luke does although talk about the gorgeus sites. That is 100% true. You get to see some of the most amazing places in the whole world.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboys is so important. Many people wouldn't think that this is something that we need in the world, but it is. It is one of the most important jobs that we need. So many great benefits that you can get from it such as learing new langauges, tasting new foods, meeting wonderful people, or simply living alone on a boat with a few animals. This might not saound as fun as you would think, but it is defeintly something to think about. not only is a great oppurtinite, but it is a great learing experince.",2
667d0d4,"The author suggest that studying Venus is worthy persuit despite

the dangerous it presents, He refers to that because ""noting"" Venus is one of the most brightest point light in the sky, and one of the planet's of our system solar, with the most ""highier"" or ""hottest"" surface of the intere system, with 800 degrees pharenheit, even though Mercury is closer to our sun, and is not closer

to Venu's temperature.

The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth;

such an evironment

would crush even a Submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our Oceans

and would liquefy many metals.

Venus

is complicated to study becase has a lot of impediments, Venusian geology and whether present additional impediments like erupting Volcanoes,powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

That make Venus complicated to study, the conditions, whether,temperatures, and preasure is hard to study his surface.

Even the light can't penetrate the dense atmotphere, and

the mores importantly, reseachers cannot take samples of rock,gas, or anything else, from a distance.

But NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were the first ebvisioned in the 1800s and palyed an important role in the 1940s during Word War ll [ 1642 ] WWll.

This project look hopefull, maybe they can study Venus on that way.      ",1
be3dfcc,"The ""Face on Mars"" is a famous landmark on, you guessed it, Mars! Many people believe that it is just a natural landform, but others believe it was created by aliens. Why do people believe that it's created by aliens? Well, they believe that the Face is bona fide proof that there is life on Mars, and NASA is hiding something from us. In my personal opinion, I believe that it's just a natural landform that just happens to look like a face. I think that because I think the odds of aliens creating a face on Mars out of no where is very illogical. So in this essay, I'm going to prove to you that the ""Face of Mars"" is actually a landform instead of an actual alien artifact!

One of the main reasons I believe that it is just a natural landform is because according to the article, mesas are something that is common around a region of Mars called Cydonia. And since the face was located in Cydonia, it wouldn't be out of place for there to be a mesa there. So in the beginning, scientists told everyone what it really was, another Martian mesa, but it was shaped like a face. But many people noted something that was in the article in paragraph 2, where it said that the mesa had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. My explanation for this is maybe the mesa was formed a certain way that made it have these out of place shadows, because not every mesa is alike and some may have different shapes than another. Also according to the article, it notes that very few scientists believe that it is an alien artifact, which means there are someone skeptics among scientists, and sure, scientists may be smarter than the average person, but that does not mean they are always correct.

Now we move along to even more important evidence, the pictures. The pictures are important because if you look at the picture of the ""Face on Mars"" taken in 1976, you could see that it really isn't that clear, but you can make out a face in it. But if you look at the better pictures in 1998 and 2001, you can see that they're a whole lot clearer than the ones in 1976. Right now I'm focusing on the one taken in 1998, which according to the article, it was posted on a JPL website where it was revealed as a natural landform. But skeptics again were skeptic as always, and said that since it was taken during the winter, which is a cloudy time on Mars, that the alien markings of the Face were hidden by haze. My reponse to this is, if there were alien markings, why couldn't you make a brief outline of them in the picture from 1976? And how do you know for sure that there are any alien markings? Many questions arose and taken pictures of the Face became a priority.

3 years later, on April 8, 2001, another picture of the Face was taken. This one was much clearer than the one in 1998 due to there being no clouds. According to the article, the pxiel size in the image was 1.56 meters, and as rule of thumb, if there were any alien markings or another of that sort, they would've been able to be seen in the picture because of the pixels. So the ""Face on Mars"" was got rid of its skeptics and now many scientists say it is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. According to the article, Garvin says it remind him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, because it is about the same height of the ""Face on Mars"".

So in conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is a mesa plain and simple, and the main reasons are because of the pictures, and overall the really big reason many mesas are common around Cydonia, which is where the Face is located. Another reason why I don't think that you should believe that it is an alien artifact is, there is so much evidence to why it isn't whenever people just pointed out obvious things in the picture, like clouds of haze covered ""markings"" in the 1998 picture but there weren't ever markings on the mesa as revealed in the next picture taken in 2001. So to end this essay, the ""Face on Mars"" is a mesa, not an alien artifact as many skeptics believe.               ",6
8e25774,"I would like to see this type of car out on the streets. The reason why I agree with my statement is because it would make that driver have a better challenge of controling the car. It will let the driver sit back while the car drives and for the driver to stay alert at the same time.

First, the reason why I said that it will give the driver a better challenge of controlling the car. The driver might be preocupided at the same time driving, so this might help the driver to not have to pay attenction on the road. Also, if the driver is running late for their work, the car can help them, instead of the driver getting a car accitedent.

Secondly, driving a driverless car might be more fun rather than the old fashion way. For the car system for the driverless, the system will shut down when the driver takes back in control. Also, this might help drivers that are learning to drive, this might help them how to control their driving skills.

Thirdly, the driver will have to stay alert while the car i driving for safety reasons. Like the car won't know how to get by through heavy traffic jams. Or through roadblocks, this are the major set backs of the driverless cars. So the car will still need the skills of the human driver to get past them.

In conclusion, the reason why I agree to this is because it will give the driver a bit of a challenge. It would give the driver to sit back while the car drives itself. These are the resorces that the driver is now give .Also, it will give the driver the sense to stay alert while the car drives.",3
dbc67ae,"My claim for, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" would go against what the author is trying to say. The reason is, because anybody can say that they made a Facial Action Coding System computers. Also the Author says that the Facial Action Coding System computers can Deteced when you are happy or when you are sad.

In Paragraph 4 it says that each expression is compared against a neutral face showing no emotion. Also it says that it can scan movements in a real face or in the the painted face of Mona Lisa. Plus it can be used for a video as well that show a new emotion with the software.

If somebody did make a computer like that then why did nobody put it in a Newspaper or even a magazine. If you are reading this then you would understand what I am trying to say or try to tell you. I think also if they did come put with the computer then people would like to be able to hear what the computer is capable of. If you understand then you would agree with me that the people should know what it does and what it can not do. If it can stop fight's then it should be brought to the people's attention, but if it can not stop fight's then it should not be brought to the people's attention. What if you the reader are using this and it tells you that you are mad then keep it. Then on the other hand you got to realize that if it says that you are mad but you are happy, then give it back to the company that you bought the item from and get your money back. So that is why my claim is going to be against what the author is trying to say.

The reason why that is my claim is because you can never trust if the item will work or not. If a real person is reading this then you will understand what I am trying to tell you. Also if you were wise as well then you can understand what I am trying say by, ""you can never trust if the item will work or not."" So this is why my claim is what it is.",2
0374dae,"On may 24,2001 NASA Viking was snapping pictures around mars when something weird showed up on one of the photos. when NASA seen what looked like a human face went crazy. An ever since NASA'S crazy image got out thousends and thousends of people all around america were talking about ""the face on mars"". But Mars Orbiter Camera team came to find that it was not a human face but just a simple natural landform.

Many people believed that it was an alien artifact. Even few sciantists believed this too. But on April 5, 1998, Mars global surveyor flew over Cydonia for the frist time .Mas Orbiter team took a picture ten times sharper then viking photo. When the picture was taken by Mars camera team showed upon a JPL web site. Showing that the image was a natural landform, that there was no alien atifact. People still don't believe that it's just a natural landform, but this picture was taken by a digital image 3 times bigger then pixel size. so if any other objects such as airplanes, egyptial shaped pyramids, or small shacks you would most definetly see them. The landform that is actually shown on mars was a commom landform around American West.

In conclusion you can see that this image was studied very hard on to find out was it actually was, wich is a natural landform found in the American West. An if you still don't believe just think about it. The image taken that reaveled it to be a natural landform had each pixel in the 2001 spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the 1976 Viking image.",3
eb810c2,"Many people such as  me have found that what is the purpose for a car when it emits gasses or does other things that people have such as smog many for some this is why they are trying to limit there use. But it does have it advantges though. Many countries have found out that limiting car usage was a great idea to do. And that is what I am going to explain to you.

People who live in Vauban, Germany in this upscale comunities are living without a car they say that the neighborhood is ""car-free"" many people in stead of driving a car they either ride a bike, walk, or thay have a car but they have to buy a space in a large garage on the outside of the comunity. And they also say that is is quiet and peacful you will hear an occasional distan moter but is drowned out with people talking bikes got past or even kids in the neighborhood.

Like many other contries they have to deal with smog fron the green house gasses for cars most areas are is 50% green house gas. But like other contries they have cars banned like in europe they fine people 22 euros ($31) some even had their car impounded for there reaction. Europe mostly blames deisel fuel because most of all the cars in europe are deisel.

People who live in Bogota, Colombia they have a day where they can't use their cars it is called car-free day millions have hiked, biked, skated or take the bus to work during this day. This is the thrid year that they have done this there are over 7 million people live there and participate to reduce smog but some don't do this and the violaters are fined $25. And they haven't stopped this even when the weather is terrible such a heavy rain but people just ignore it.

That was my explanation on how people feel about limiting the use of cars wether it is car-free day in columbia fining people in europe or just have your car somewhere else like the neighborhood in Vauban, Germany people who try to limit their use of there cars ussaly follow this.    ",2
6425823,"ELECTORAL COLLEGE

I strongly believe that the electoral college is the right way to go. The reason I feel this way is because of the electors, our founding fathers and, political parties.

I like that three electors is representing a state. I believe that the electors know more about the government than regular people. I want someone that knows what they are doing when they go to represent our state! There are 538 electors that vote for president and vice president but there only has to be 270 votes required to elect the president or vice president. Congress has to count the votes in the same place that the electors voted in. Sometimes I don't agree with the president that they picked but I'm glad that honest people count the votes. When the votes are finished and the winner's name is called out the losers revive a certificate of ascertainment.

Also a big part of me wants to keep the electoral college is because of our founding fathers. They put in so much work to help us. I would hate for all there hard work to go to waste. Also they had to put their lives on the line to help crate it. They broke so many laws  for us! Also think about not only did they put their lives in danger but their families life at risk! To me that took a strong amount of courage! I'm honored to talk about our founding farther any time! In the 23 amendment our founding fathers wrote the district of Columbia is allowed three electors and for them to be treated like a state! Also our founding fathers wrote that only citizens that are qualified to vote! Key word here people ''Qualified!'' As long as everyone remembers that key word then, we all should be fine!

I know! I know! A lot of people hate political parties but, I like them. Just think about when you were in school and you wanted to be class president so bad. The people who voted for you is like your political party. I know I loved my political party because they helped me win! Your political party helps come up with all kinds of cool ideas to get people to vote for you. Like when I was running for class president my political party baked cookies, passed out fliers and, help me wright my speech! That's just like when you run for president and vice president. Except I don't think they really pass out cookies when you run to be the real deal president! I know I would vote for the president if he or she gave me a cookie! Ha ha ha ha I crack myself up but it's the truth! Hint Hint for the next election I better be at the top of the list if someone decides to give out cookies!

I agree with the Electoral College because I want what's best for my state, family and, friends!    ",3
3616ff5,"My opinion on driverless cars, i think it would be a stupid idea because i love to drive and im sure there are alot of other people who love to drive. Driverless cars could be a big problem, what if a driverless car had a malfunction and could wreck and kill somebody. Im sure the goverment would disagree with this idea because they love to make money, and all the money to make driverless cars would be outrageous, and that could make the goverment go in dept and it could ruin alot of things.

No details support my position because im against it, like i said i love to drive and i wanna be able to go wherever i want in the future and not have to worry about not having my own car because driverless cars just sound stupid. What if these driverless cars have a malfunction and just took off on its own i wanna be able to have my own car and drive on my own, because what if i end p getting a audi gr im sure ill be the one wanting to drive by myself and like i said everyone loves driving so i really dont like the idea.

These people who make the driverless cars such as nissan and audi, how do they know they can even make these cars to where it wont wreck on its own, or get us to where we need to go, the only thing i think would be cool about it is if i am tired and im driving and i need to go to sleep and the car could drive on its own, but what if a deer jumped in front of the car and the car is going 60 mph the car isnt just going to stop your going to wreck. If they really wanna make these cars they need to have good protection like a tank or sometin because that would be safe. Im still against it but it would be pretty cool to see what they can really do in the future.      ",2
b29e15a,"Limiting car usage can be a major impact on our everyday life. Just think about what would happen if people stopped using their cars and started walking or riding bikes for transportation. If we did that it would reduce greenhouse gas in Europe, it would also limit the amount of money spent on fuel used by the everyday economy, further more it would lower air polution.

First off, b limiting the epidemic of car usage it would reduce greenhouse gas in Europe .

Now in Europe 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions is made up of passenger cars. And 5o percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Just by taking a bus or riding a bike for transportation you could help limit  this cause. Its been plenty efforts in the past but now its starting to take affect exspecially in the suburbs.

Further more, we could be reducing the amount of fuel we need all over the world just by limiting the amount of time you use your car. We spend more money on fuel than we do anything else. Why, well because eveything needs fuel now a days. Diesels makes up 67 percent of vechicles in France,compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. We could really be putting our money towards other thing such as parks and rebuilding our communities. A study last year showed that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009..

Also, one of our major problems is air polution. We have a very high concentration of it. Well because majority of the people drivr their cars and cars take up fuel then that fuel is released through the motor and it gets into the air. Now just by limiting your car usage you good take aways stress and lower the amount of air polution said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. He and his wife made a difference just by riding a two-seat bicycle. As a result of the recession many may find less reason to resume the habit.

In conclusion, you can make a difference just by doing one little thing. Just sit back and think about what huge of an impact it will be if you lower your car usage. You can be that helping hand that reduces greenhouse gas not jujst for you but for evryone around you. Help limit the amount of money spent on fuel, we could be using that money for something usefull. Last but not least help lower the air polution it would really make a difference. Help make that change!                                             ",3
395ace8,"The idea of driverless cars is exremely crazy, and doesn't make any sense. Creating a 100% hands free car is just another way to make America more lazy than we already are. Completely driverless cars are too big of a leap considering all the accidents that still occur with the drivers hand are on the wheel, and manufacturers still want to create a car that mimics the skill of a human? What if a malfunction occurs while the car is in motion? What if someone gets injured? These things must be considered if safety is a big concern.

The most important thing when driving is keeping your eyes on the road at all times. However, manufacturers are planning on inserting in-car entertainment which is more than likely going to result in the drivers taking their eyes of the road. What about the flashing lights on the windshield? That sounds like a great idea! No seriously, how dangerous is that? If they're too into the in-car entertainment they may not even see the flashing lights. Or the worst case senario the driver could be sleep, bored from having to wait their turn to drive or just sitting there in general. Safety is the most important, not making driving easier.",3
d4dfd0f,"Self driven cars or driverless cars if you please. An ambition many have be looking forward to for decades. The technology is closing in on us and inch by inch we move towards these machines. But, are they worth it? Yes! Self driven vehicles are the future of driving, they can offer much more reliability than humans every could.

Many adults partake in drugs, let's use alcohol for example. This drug is perfectly legal however, it is not legal to drive while under the influence of alcohol. It is also illegal to be on public property while intoxicated. This includes the sidewalk, parks, even the street infront of a person's own home. So how do you get home! Alot of men and women under the influence of alcohol decide they can drive themselves home. ""Yes, it's against the law but, I've been driving for years and nobody will even notice."" People do notice, especially when they are ran over by an intoxicated driver. Another method of getting home is by taxi or uber. With a taxi or uber there is a drivertaking you to the designated location of your choosing. One problem with this is it costs money. The more serious problems are that a person doesn't know who is about to pick him up in a taxi or uber car. The driver could rob, rab, and/or kill him. Or the opposite. The taxi driver doesn't know what kind of person is getting into the vehicle and has no clue what they are capable of, especially when they are drunk. While both of these solutions of getting home bring quite horrible possible outcomes the driverless car does not. In a driverless car one can hop in, zoom home, hop out, and walk into their home without breaking the law, injuring someone,or being injured themself.

An additional bonus provided by the self driven car is efficiency and green thumb. A massive threat posed to Earth is the admission of harmful toxins into the air. Gasoline is considered one of these toxins. When a human drives they excellerate and decellerate in unportionate mannaers. The more you excell and decell the more fuel one omits into the atmosphere. Add-ons such as cruise control have been added to many cars to avoid omitting so much gas but humans still make sudden stops and speed right backe up from 6mph to the speed limit of 45mph. With the self driven car sensors will be aware of its surroundings and if one driverless car needs to make a stp it will slow down in advance to avoid collison then accelerate at the best given speed to omit the least amount of gasoline into the air as possible. Thus, keeping the passangers of the vehicles as well as the Earth.

Their are neccesities humans put upon themselves that a robotic machine never would. Humans have the need to sleep, the need to blink, the need to eat and humans place false neccesities upon themselves such as doing make-up to

look pretty, texting a friend on the cell phone, and other social media concerns. What this does is cause distraction for a driver. When a driver is texting on their phone and gets an itch in their eye and cannot stop blinking, that driver is not fully focused on the road, the vehicle, other vehicles surrounding him, and pedestrians. This creats a dangerous enviornment for any structure living or non-living near this vehilce. Humans tend to not sleep as often as they should which leaves a person to be tired on their way driving to work as well as driving home form work. Boom! Bang! Crash! What just happened? A person fell asleep at the wheel and possibly injured or killed themself as well as any bystanders. There is no concern with these neccesities humans have and palce on themselves when it comes to a driverless vehicle. The vehicle controls all movements getting a person to their destination as safe as possible. A driverless car doesn't fall asleep at the whell, it doesn't need sleep! A driverless car doesn't need to eat, just fill it up with gas and it's ready to go! A driverless car most definetly doesn't feel the need to interact on social media, so no worries there.

The self driven car is a dream that will oneday be fulfilled! There is no stopping this inveitable. Just understand, that the benefits that will come from these machines are heaven sent. Safety, reliabillity, and pretty darn cool! Be prepared for the driverless cars because the driverless cars are prepared for you.                                                                                                              ",5
c0b4881,"According to my scientific studies done at NASA, this landform is natural. It is not made by aliens. I have done much research in my day as a scientist at NASA, and I know that plates on a surface can shift land due to forces, and that is why I do not believe this ""face"" was made by aliens.

I believe this face on Mars is natural because aliens are not real. This face on Mars just happens to look like a face. In my experienced years of being a sceintist, I know people get fired up about things that are not supposed to look like something else but they do. This is a perfect examle of just that! This face is naturally made, but because it looks like the face of an Egyptian Pharaoh, it is different. Just because it looks like something does not mean that aliens or something else that is creapy made it. This landform just happened to look like a face. That is that. There is not enough evidence to support that aliens made the Pharaoh-face landform, so for now, let us consider the face naturally made.

Overall, I believe this face is naturally made. There is no evidence that supports the fact that aliens went to Mars and made a face on the surface so the entire planet Earth could see it and become curious. On the other hand, there is more evidence to support the scientific theory; The landform is naturally made. Aliens are not real, and there is litle to no evidence to support the alien theory. Until someone comes to me and finds supporting details about aliens creating this landform, I will not change my thoughts and views on the whole situation.   ",3
c3fe53f,"Dear State Senator

The Election System should be changed to popular vote. The Electoral College is unfair and irratinol. It should be cancelled, and be based upon popular vote with numbers that make since. Many votes have been barely won because the numbers are so close and high. The Electoral College Isn't an amount of how many people voted for a president, its for an elector. And you dont always pick your elector, it could get confused and a wrong elector could get picked.

Many states do not have a fair chance to vote, And one representitive can count as too many votes compared to their own value. Sates that didnt have the chance to see the canidates were most likely ignored wich dosent help because even if the people guessed a vote the electors would give out a large number of votes randomly to a canidate. Some staes didnt even get so see an ad for the canidates once.

""A single representitive from whyoming representing five hundred thousand representitives would have as much to say as fifty five representitives from California, who represnt thirty five million voters.""  "" During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt get to see the canidates at all,Including rhode island and south carolinia, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad.""

These qoutes from bradford plumber, explain that half of the peoples votes were going to wrong canidates as the pepole were completley confused about who they were even voting for. They didnt even get Ads that could give them at least a look or a hint, basically, the people were clueless. It even seems a little unorganized, the Electoral College dosent make much since either based on the information given, but what you should really think about is how the Electoral College has hint of trying to cheat its way into electing a canidate.

In addition, The voters are left with an unfair outcome at almost every election because of the Electoral Collage. The votes can either be very close or the people could miss Ads or campaigns for canidates, leaving the people with nothing and confusion all over. Even if you knew what elector you voted for, you cant necessarily pick who it is your voting for and your vote could possibly get confued giving you a bad outcome. Most elections are just slid by and are just based on what ever the Electoral College thinks should happen. So please abolish the Electoral College its is irrational and is not neccessary, let the people really have a fair chance.            ",4
02cbcbc,"There are many different negavtives and positives when it comes to driverless cars. Knowing the goods and bads about these special cars can be good for the future when investing in one some day. Having a car that can drive itself, communicate with you and your actions, interact with how you drive could be a good thing. What if something was to go wrong? Being able to know how these things works and whats good and not so good about them could, never know, save your life.

These new and improved cars have positive things about them. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a car. Half a million miles is quite a lot without anything going wrong. it goes to show they can be reliable when wanting to drive a greater distance. There is more about these self-driving cars many dont know. Gm had developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in a danger of backing into an object. Therefor, the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.

Today, we don't exacly know how or what these self-driving cars are going to have in them or how they may run in the future. There are many positive things that have come upon us when investigating in this new invention but what could possibly go wrong? During the making of these cars there is a lot of technology and a whole lot of sensors. While driving thses cars, lets say on the highway, and something was to go out or mountfunction. Yes, it could happen to any vehicle in the world. The only problem is if the car itself is driving and something was to happen would the driver be able to take control or would the car freeze everything up an something bad happen? Google, BMW, and anyone else involved in this think of all the good possible things but there could be so many negatives that could really be lifechanging.

My opinion on Diverless cars is good for the most part. Say you have to drive a long ways and you need a break from driving, the car could take over instead of having to stop at night and drive for you. Its crazy to think that in a few years these cars could become our lives. ""Telsa has projectd 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" ( Driveless Cars are Coming.)

So, as you think more about it, most positive things could also be negative things when it comes to self-driving cars. In a few years havinng these cars could change our lives or make them harder. From the cars driving a half a million miles to having gadgits to help you focus on driving to not so much the technology problems that could cause bad news for a lot of people. Never know, one day we might have cars driving us around instead of us driving them.",4

Venus is the second planet in our solar system, also Venus is the closest planent to the Earth according the density and size and distnace too. ? Venus,Earth and Mars our other planeth neighbor,orbit the sin at different speeds. Tha? is means we are closer to mars and other times to Venus."" Our Earth run around of the sun doing a eje of simetry. That is way sometimes We are closet to Venus. Venus is a little planet and always are closet to the corner. ""Talking in space terms""

During the whole existing the humans are sent spacecraft to find out information about if exist life over there. But each mission was unmanned and the scientifics can tell since no spacecracft survived the landing for more that a few hour.

According the article, some factors contribute to the reputation of venus as a challegin palnet for humans study,despite it is proximity to us. Venus after mentioned as a little planet is a one a planet with 97 percent of carbon oxide,that's means we were the carbon dioxide for survived. Venus has corrisive sulfuric in the atmosphere,that is a danger for us health. According the article ""It has a temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit because Mercury is closer to the sun and sun is closest to Venus"".

The NASA is back of all that. They are studing all about venus. Some studies show NASA's possible solution to the hostilecondition on the surface of venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. In space terms and referent to the article. ""Venus was probably covered largely with ocean and could have supported various forms of life"" The studies show that venus accordin the information ""The Venus planet has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar such as velleys,mountains,and craters"". That's means Venus can be our another option for a planetary visit.

In conclusion, I can say that Venus is a option that we have if sometimes will happening on our Earth. That is a option for life. Venus is a planet that it will be Innovation and Technology for survive. Venus is a despite the danguerous,we can have resistant to pressure. Venus can be our salvation. ",1
aca775b,"Driverless Cars Are Coming

As technology evolves, there are better things that come into this world. Not only are the positive effects from a great technology, but there is also negative effects. Some technologies have more negative consequences than positive. One example of this includes driverless cars. Although they have not officially come out yet, they are still working on it. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Though it might be a great technology for the future, it might not be the best technology to release just yet. Having a driverless car has way to many negative effects. These negative effects include: it could cause an accident and no one is responsible, a person can not enjoy driving, and if we have driverless cars there will have to be new laws that have to be put on the cars that could take a long time and most people do not like waiting.

A new technology always has consequences. One consequence of having a driverless car is that when an accident happens no one is to blame for the accident. In the world there is always someone to blame. That is just how the world works. One day a driverless car hits someone with an actual driver. The world will still have regular cars because not all people can afford such a luxory as a driverless car. Who is the actual driver suppose to talk to if he or she gets hit? There might be no one in the car and what happens from there? If these cars get released, the owner should always be in the car just in case this situation happens. One might say that it is a driverless car for a reason. Where is the car suppose to go if no one is in it? The car has no where to be unless there is someone going to another place. This is just one negative effect of driverless cars.

Some people really enjoy driving their car. The new car smell and the feel of how the car moves against the pavement. The thrill of the speed and adrenaline that the car has. No one can enjoy these feelings if no one is driving the car. Driverless cars might have electronic intelligence, but they do not have any feelings toward what is actually going on. If the world switches over to driverless cars how is anyone suppose to enjoy racing? Racing might be boring to some, but it is not boring to others. Racing is one of the true American sports. People who drive cars for a living really enjoy driving. That is why they have the job. If driverless cars come out on the market, it will put millions of people out of a job and then they can not provide for their family. Having a car that people can drive is very important and if a company takes the joy of having a car and a job away from people, that will be wrong.

One more consequence of having this new technology will be new laws. Everything great always has to have laws and consequences. Just like anything else in the world, there will be restrictions. One important thing about passing a law is that it takes a long time to get it into actual power. Time is what no one has. Having patience is good, but in a society where everything is moving 100 miles per hour, this law will take to much time to get into action. These driverless cars will need to have many laws. These laws will have to state who is responsible for a crash the owner or the company, where these cars can be and not be, and who can actually be behing the wheel of the driverless cars. New technology can be good, but in this case having a driverless car is obviously not the best idea that America has ever had.

In conclusion, having a driverless car has way to many negative effects and consequences. From this article we know that if we take away the joys of driving, people will be upset and maybe they will be without a job. We also know that if there accident no one will be responsible and that is not human nature. The world just not work in this manner. Also, new laws will have to be put in place to keep the world safe and are own precious lives. Laws take a long time to pass and patience is not one of the best qualities that everyone might or might not have. To have the power to put in a technology so great in society is awesome, but knowing that people could lose their lives and the enjoyment of having is car is not something society needs.",5

8963d4c,"The founding fathers established the electoral college in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election by the popular vote of the citizens. It consist of 538 electors. The electoral college may have served its purpose in the past, but in todays world, it's outdated, irrational, and unfair to voters. Over 60 percent of voters say they would prefer a direct election over the kind we have now.

As with a few other things in the constitution, the electoral college is outdated. It is widely regarded as an anachronism, a thing that seems to belong to the past and not fit in the presen t, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most populaar votes the winner. The electoral college is very biased because the presidential candidates or a party's central commitee can choose the electors which may cause them to vote unaccording to the majority vote.

The most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state only gets one vote, the single representative from Wyoming would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California. Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system which could easily throw off the vote and make it swing in the wrong direction and thus, against the voters popular vote. This makes the electoral college irrational.

Lastly, the electoral college is just unfair. Not only could it be corrupted by bridery, but because of the winner-take-all in each state, cnadidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all.

In conclusion, the electoral college is outdated, irrational, and unfair. The best arguements for it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. As Bob Doe said: Abolish the electoral college!    ",2

France has alreayd issued a ban on cars and has even had certain cars banned on certain days. For instance, even number car plates could not be used for driving on Monday's, odd number plates were banned for Tuesday's. This was to help reduce the amount of smog in the French air as they rely mostly on diesel rather than gas. In Vauban, Germany street parking, driveways and home garages have been banned from neighborhoods. You could now only buy a house with a garage for $40,000. This cause more people to stop using cars, and others to sell them to live in the upscale neighborhoods. Many of the Ford and Mercedes car dealerships are considering changing their train of car producing to the newer ideal of intertiwning public transportation with the up and coming ideas of bikers on the rodes, and people using buses and subways instead of their own cars.

In Paris the smog in the air was soon thicker than it was in Beijing, China the citied known for its polluted air. Soon Parisian officials enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the smog. Monday's, motorists with even-numbered plates had been ordered to leave their cars at home or get a 22-euro fine, which is also $31. The same requirements were set in place for odd-numbered plates the following day. The first time this new ban was enforced nearly 4,000 dirvers were fined. Some even had their cars impounded for thier reaction to the new fine. The amount of traffic was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after the five days of an intensifying smog. The smog was caused by cold nights and warm days that caused the warmer layer of air to trap the car emissions. Diesel fuel was, of course, blammed as France has a tax policy for diesel fuel over gassoline. 67 percent of vehicles in Frane, compared to the 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. Paris would typically have more smog than the other European countries with the percentage of diesel fule they use daily. Paris had 147 micrograms of diesel per cubic meter last week compared to 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. Delivery companies lost revenue, but this starte an exception for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Soon the smog had cleared anouth on Monday for the ruling French party to take away the ban for odd-numbers plates on Tuesday.

The United States has long since been one of the world's prime car cultures. President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse has emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitious assist from a incipient shift in American behavior.    ",2

Not most people have vehicals because of the payment range and if we can change that who knows we might not have to have buses, taxi, etc any more, and the people will have more money to take care of their children and its also gonna help with car crashes and lowering how many we have every year or so. Allowing kids16+ to drive the less crashes will help majorly. Also with the insureance itll cost less but will the insurance go out of buisness ?

c038b3a,"There are many fellow citizens in the world that have been using cars are having car accidents and many more terribles things that have happen during inside of a car or outside of a car. According to the passage, Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters. Is better to take a walk, ride a bike, and make the streets a better place. Especially, that up to 50 percent in the United States, there are car-intensive areas. Car- free day, was a big hit in Bogota, and should make it in the United States one day to leave the streets without traffic jams.

First, fellow citizens should stop the car usage, to make the streets a better place, walk, ride a bike, or do something that would make the streets much safer. The cars usage, many people have died for these terrible accidents. Limiting car usage, is a great idea, because it supports the streets to not become very dangerous. There are many accidents that have caused of a hit-and-run. So is very important that at least the car usage should stop the humanity.

Next, Limiting car usage, is a great idea, because, according to the passage, up to 50 percent in the United States, there are car-intensive areas. Car-intensive areas, such as the traffic jam. Traffic jam, can be very dangerous at some point, and it keeps people very tired and fustrated. According to the article, In Bogota, Colombia, there's a program set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to keep the area as a car-free day, leaving the streets devoiding of traffic jams. So try to ride a bike, walk, skate, or do something, that can be a car-free day, a much safer environment.

Then, Limiting car usage, is a great idea, also, because without cars, and only buses and taxis, a which the main goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, Violators have faced $25 of fines, according to the article, also. Its a really good opportunity to take away the stress and lower air pollution from cars, especially the stress from traffic jams. As what i was saying in the beggining, that many people prefer to use bike, walk, or skate to keep themselves a much safer habit. If your driving, always put on the seatbelt to prevent from car accidents. Limiting car usage is a great way to prevent from all the car accidents out there in the world.

Last, Limiting car usage is a great way to the environment, makes the countries a better place. Having a car-free day, especially, is a much safer way to its environment. Ride a bike, walk, skate, or take a bus, if necessary, to prevent from all the car accidents out there in the world, it takes away the stress and decrease its air pollution from having a car-free day, and to promote from alternative transportation and reducing smog. Limiting car usage, is great way to our planet, but there is times that we need it for transporting to a place we want to go. Also, using a bike, walking, or skating is a great tool and excercise to our legs to keep our body maintained and healthy.            ",4
006c931,"What if we could tell how all of the people us were without even asking. Most people can tell when someone is sad, happy, or mad just by looking at them, but what happens when that person is hiding how they are truely feeling. What then? Well new techonlogy can allow us to see exctly how someone, who is trying to hide there emotions, is feeling. This is unfair for many reasons. The technology may be cool but people have a right to keep how they are feeling a secert.

The computer software works by making a 3-D computer model of the face; the computer watches the different muscles in the face move to identify how the person is feeling. The technolgy delevopted by Dr. Huang can even calculate mixed emotions with the exact percent of how strong the emotions are. Dr. Huang obseres that ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" I htought people expressed emotions in different ways though? Dr Hoang also states that ""even though individuals often show verying degrees of expression.""

People have a right to not tell people how they are feeling. Did we really need to know the Mona Lisa was 9 percent disgusted? Now that raises the question of why? Was Leonardo de Vinci's hair messed up? Or did she think he needed to take a shower? What is the point in knowing someone is feelings without knowing why? We do not need technology to ask someone how they are feeling. or even why the are feeling the way they are feeling that way.

There are really no benfits to knowing how someone is feeling without knowing why. The technology is very cool. It is crazy how Dr Huang was able to develope a computer that uses muscle movment to idenitfy emotions. The technology is useless though unless you are prepare and willing to ask why? ",3

For one reason it would have to be when they painted a picture of her for acomplishing the process of the model of a great model she smiled for that picture. So that is why that gave her own picture of herself and the computer model picture is a little bit better than the orignal one. The computer model has better details in the picture and it also tightens her lips for the picture. More reason is that they express the emotion of her picture in paragraph 2. In paragraph 7 the experts for the picture tell Mona Lisa how to pose for the picture in the first sentence. Paragraph 8 explains Mona being truthful and smiling in the last sentence. Inside Paragraph 4 it is telling about how the expression of the real face is inside the art of Mona Lisa.,1

Although these driveless cars are like riding on robot humans, what if they begin to malfunction causeing way more car crashes or destorying more than a person driving a vehicle itself. Having a driveless car sounds great, and thats what all drivers dream of especialy elders, but if you think about it, it could be just as dangerous. Even with the driveless car theres still driveing youll have to put forth and do at times, like when this get to dangerous for the car to handle. Well what if the car got you into that dangerous situation? Driveless cars are a bad idea.

They may come with all the latest technology and so much cool gajits, but if you think about it, it all might come falling apart sooner or later. As the years progress the cars are turning into this like in 2013 BMW came up with the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". Honestly there putting in cars what we get on the outside. I dont think a car should be so advanced.

GM devoloped driver seats that vibrate when the vehichle is in danger, the only thing i like that they put i the car is the text free hands while youre driving, because you wouldnt be in all that much danger if you would just pay attention. If you really think about it driving safety is common sense and the driveless car is pointless.

You can learn about the seas if you want to travel around the world on a sea boat. You can also learn about the famous enough wars like World War ll .

fb9166d,"There are many advantages of limiting car usage and today ima tell you a few reasons why that is true.

Time after time day after day we use our cars or motorcycles to get from point A to point B some may think that by driving from point A to point B is harmless but im here to tell other wise. Driving your car or motorcycles everday to work causes pollution in the air it makes the air we breath nasty an unhealty it even causes the temputure to rise which is a big no no the antarticle will melt an rise sea levels. So limiting car usage makes the air a little cleaner an healtier to breath

Limiting car usage even helps you save a little extra money cause with gas prices so high it aint cheap to get from point A to point B it cost more to travlel. In some places they even offerd free transport from friday to monday which is great! who wouldnt want free transport i mean whats better than saving money an helping the pollution decrease making the air more freasher an clean. Atfer days of near record pollution paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city those who refused to obey were fined 22 euro($31) other got the vechials impounded

The less cars on the street the less likley accidents are to happpen sometimes the roads are just to pack an squished you can braley get by thats why many car accidents happen with the car free day makes everyone a little more safer. since the car free day the parks and sports centers have bloomed many peopel are out having a good time riding thier bikes an enjoying the fresh air they dont have to worry about cars hitting them or wasting gas an polluting the air.

In the untied states the enviromental protection agency is promting car reduced communities. many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill. Americans are buying fewer cars drving less and getting fewer licenses each year goes by.    ",3
a8b8909,"The Electoral College has many amazing things people like about using it .When it comes to voting not many people do .Thats why in the Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. There are about 538 electors, now that's alot of people if you ask me. Only 270 of the electoral votes is required to elect the President which is an okay amount of votes for the President election.

On the other hand, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who inturn elect the president. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themeselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, but the system allows much worse. People are more worried about having a tie in the electoral vote. The election would be thrown in the House of Representatives, where state delegation vote on the President, also the senate would choose the Vice President.

Not everyone thinks the same tho about electoral College because some people dont like it because some states have more representatives,but yet again what if it was your state that have the most representatives like Califorina with 55 of them wouldnt you want a huge avantage like that?

dc3add1,"Do you think the face on Mars was created by aliens?

How can you believe that the face on Mars was aliens? it is obviously just another landform of Mars'. Here, i'll go through some evidence that it is just a landform.

First of all, landforms like that are common in Cydonia. Also, keep in mind that appearances can be decieving. You can even see a similar landform right by the ""face"". And plus, there is no scientific evidence of life on another planet, let alone Mars. Simply stating that a haze could've hid the ""alien"" markings is hardly a compelling argument.

Second off, The photo they took in 2001 proves even further that it just a normal martian messa. and accourding to the article that have read, ""you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" if you want to check this article out, you can find that information in paragraph 11. so if there were any alien objects, you could both see what they were and even know what they were.

I think i have proven my point. so don't even try to argue that, you will not succeed. i know that you might say, well NASA is just lying. My response is that if you had the money to afford a satellite and you sent there, with the current high grade cameras, you would find that you were wrong all along. so yes I win this argument, and that the ""face"" on Mars is just a messa.",3
6afe275,"I think that the author made a very good point about the exploration of Venus. The author is tring to make people understand that, even though Venus is a very inhospitable planet, its still a good idea to study it. The author says that astronomers think that Venus could have once held life.

One piece of textual evidence is in paragraph 4, line 2, it states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus becuase it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" I chose this quote because the author is telling us that since Venus may have been like earth once before then maybe it had complex life. If complex life is on Earth then maybe complex life was on Venus at some point as well.

In paragraph 7, line 1, it says""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus."" In this quote he is saying that NASA is already working on more approaches to Venus and, therefore that proves that NASA is still intersted in Venus.

In paragraph 7, line 7, he states""Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin"" This quote was chose because the idea behind it is not far fetched because if you use any modern electonics then they would probably melt and, then they wouldn't work. The heat on Venus is far greter than on Earth so we would need a special type of metal to useon those missions.

In conclusion the idea of returing to Venus is not that bad of an idea. The author did a great job explaing why we should go bake to Venus. I understood everything that the author wrote.   ",3
2b8abd3,"There are many diffrenet views when it comes to driveless car, but im here to explain why it is a good reason to have driveless cars. ONe of the first reasons why driveless cars are a good idea is first that cars are getting smater, and saferfor the driver and passangers, plus they tend to cost about the same as much as a normal car. For example In 2013 BMW announced the development of ""traffic jam assistant"" and this car could handle drving functionns at sppeds up to 25 mph,but special touch sensors make sure the driver holds onto the wheel. A second reason why driveless cars are a good idea is because it will help people who are drving for long period of time. for example the ""trafic jam assisant comesto play so say a driver happens to fall asleep and lets their feet off the gas the car will keep drving and control the wheel unitl the driver lets go of it and thats when the car lets a alarm off so that the driver can wake up and hopefully pull over safely. One last reason why driveless cars are a good idea is because if we happen to make drvieless cars for people in general then we could do it for people who drive as their work for example truck drivers. usually they have to make it to a certain destionation at a certain time to deliver something. Usually this can be very dangerours not only to the truck driver but to the people is their cars trying to drive around the truck driver.

I feel that electoral college should stay becuase it set's straight the manege for the peoples votes for the president. Even thow if a tie the election would be thrown to the house of represenatives were they decide on the new president. The electoral college is a process its not a place. It shows that the founding fathers established it for the compromise between elections between the president by a vote in congress. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. Plus a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president .It say's in the passage that under the 23rd Amendment of the constiton that the district of colombia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for the purposes of electoral college. On many cases 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election. The electoral college system states that voters vote not for the president,but for a state of eletors who elect the president. I think that they should have the right to elect the president that would make this nation grow stonger not to make mistakes and lead us to problems which they can decide to choose the future of the united states.

I also know this happens to other kids because too because when i'm bored I look around the room so i see all the other students who are not paying attention. If a student were toget mad and the computer sensed this and changed up the lesson then that could get the student back into it and make them want to do the work. these computers would make it the same as having a perfect teacher there for every student.

ef07889,"In this story, the author talks about how humans are capable of landing on Venus and checking the planet out. He states that there are many dangers like the high atmospheric pressure Venus has, and that Venus has the hottest temperature surface in all of the planets. Each mission they had was unmanned, and no space craft survived a landing for more than a few hours. The author supports his claim of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers bad because he explains that there are more dangers than possibilities and they have just conducted research and never tried or invented anything he states yet.

NASA says they could create a blimp- like vehicle that hovers about 30 or so miles above Venusian landscape. This would work out because they have liveable conditions from where they are floating at, but they couldn't do anything with the info they get. When they are 30 miles above the ground it makes it difficult because most forms of light can only cover the dense atmosphere. The text states, ""Most importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" This is saying that scientists wouldn't be able to take substances form Venus back home to the US and the scientists would mainly have to explain all there observations from sight. The author also talks about how scientists are working on innovations and certain inventions that have not happend yet so he can't explain more details on how they could make it to Venus but many things have to be innovated first.

NASA is also working on other approaches to get to Venus, but we can't start sending people to Venus if we don't even know if the invention or approach could work. There are more dangers than ways to get to Venus safely in this article so that is also a reason why I think he does a bad job supporting his claim. Venus to me is not really worth researching for just because of those conditions that the planet has, but if the blimp-like thing works out, I still think the scientists wouldn't be able to see what they wanted and get no good evidence. Like I said, pictures and any light source would be hard to get when you're in Venus. NASA and other researchers should focus on a different planet than Venus because It would be way to difficult to get people there, yet alone get reseach from Venus.   ",3
bcb1861,"I think that it would be useful in a classroom because sometimes the teacher cant always read the students facial expressions and will keep teaching the same boring class. But if we used the new technology that could read the kids faces and change the course of the class to make it more interesting, then more kids wouldn't be bored all the time and they will be able to learn more about the subject that they are learing about.

The new technology could also save more money by not having to have alot of teachers in the classrooms and they could use for food, newer technology, and maybe a better building. Also kids might not like some of the teachers that are in the classrooms and the teachers might not like the kids that are in their either, so with the new technolgy replacing a teacher would save them arguments with the kids and teachers.

5d3b183,"The use of Facial Action Coding System is useful and valuable to read the emotional expressions of students because it will benefit and help teachers in classrooms understand what the student is truly feeling and what is going on in their mind.

This technology system will be ""able to detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" Many students in class have anxiety of speaking infront of many people, fear of being wrong, and not asking questions when they don't know what is going on. They will know when and how to help students through the help of the system.

Another reason why Facial Action Coding System will improve classroom environments and the learning skills of all the students is the system will let teachers know when the student is angry because when the ""orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens you lips to show anger.""(3)

If a student is angry, the system will detect it and the teachers will know as well. Anger can indicate many things in a student. Something may not be okay at home or in their family. The student may have too much going on in their life. When this happens, students tend to hide their emotions and not ask for help, when in reality they do. The system would automatically give intail on the emotion to the teacher so they can offer help, guidance and support to the student and let them know that a teacher is there for them.

Students would not learn anything if they are too distracted or too tired. If there is a technology to read students' emotional expressions, it would benefit teachers because the system will notice the emotions they might be feeling like ""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and saddness..."" (3). If the teacher knows what the students true feelings are, for example boredom, This Facial Action Coding System would help teachers know ""...when a student is becoming confused or bored... then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""(6)

In this case it would be alot more safer for us and the enviorment as they say in passage 1 saying that the cars would use half the gas we use today. Theres more pros than cons in this invention and it would be a great accomplishment to creat a car with these abilities.

Google cars are here not yet purchasable , but they are made and tested.

With this long period of time they should create the best saftey precautions in the vehicle itself. With these new features im sure that they would bring in high saftey precaution in these vehicles because this is a new era of mobile vehicles. The fact there would be less accidents and fewer human fault accidents. There would be less tickets and fewer police officers running around pulling people over. If they make this car how i am thinking they will they could change everything about the art of driving.

Less gas more money thats what we all want. More money thats what youll have after Google release these driverless cars. The bonus will be a healthier enviorment. Half the gas half the polution. The enviorment is severly important to us. The air we breath, the food we eat, the pure decorations, the way we live is based on this huge factor of the enviorment the more healthier it is the better we live. With this car great things will happen outside and inside our wallets.

Based on these facts in the article theres a definate change becoming afloat the way we live will change for a long time. We get alot of improvements when they release this driverless car the rules will change for the better. We will see our family members safer with these automibles on the market. Lets make society great again with Google Driverless Cars. ",3
d4fcd5c,"My thoughts on driverless cars, I don't think its a good idea to have these driverless cars. They could have techonical problems. They could also go against the driver laws we have today.

I think cars should have techonogly inhanced in the cars, but I don't think that driverless cars is a good idea. Say if you own one of this driverless cars, and it just turn on by itself and drive down the street crash or even run someone over, who's going to be the blame, the driver or the manufacturer. In the artical, in paragraph nine it states that ""traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.""

And humans should be reponsible what they do with their car and how they drive their cars.

My second reason I go against driverless cars is that, if we do have these driverless cars, change of laws have to be done and even maybe new laws have to be added.

That might affect teens or even young adults who wants to own thier perment. But they wouldn't have to even drive the car, because the car is mainly is driving them.

In conclusion, driverless cars might be trouble for most of us or not. Eventhough automakers are still continuing their work for the development of these cars. We still might have a couple of these cars driving around, but I think maybe we still have a chance of just non-driverless cars and having humans drive cars.",3
94f61c6,"In my opinion I think that driverless cars would be a wonderful thing to have. They would make it much easier to commute to and from work or school. They would also make taking long roadtrips much more enjoyable, being that you would not always have to keep starring at the road ahead in the long, boring sort of way that we have to now.

Driverless cars would also be great for public transportation, being that they could exempt the need for a driver, that would allow companies to make more profit, which in turn would allow for better up-keep on the buses, trams, etc. Also allowing for newer and better modes of transportation to be purchased, all around it would benefit the public transportation industry.

Even if we did not have autonomous, driverless, cars the roads would still be better if we had cars that sensed the road conditions and kept track of the driver to help with accident prevention. It would decrease the number of deaths caused each year by distracted driving, and also maybe even help make the human population as a whole better drivers in the fact that we would realize all of the things that we do wrong while driving and maybe try to correct those things.

Then there is the other side to the autonomous, driverless, cars. Yes they would be good because they would decrease the number of accidents that are caused by distractred dirvers, but this may also be a bad thing. Most humans, if you give them something that can make them have to work less, will rely souly on that one product to do all that it can possibly do to help them, but when that product has a malfunction it could be disasterous.

Lets use this as an example, Johnny and a few of his friends are driving up twisty mountain road in his autonomous car, Johnny, relying on his autonomous car to do its job of driving, is paying no attention to the road ahead. The driving system of the car has a small malfunction in the turning system, the road takes a sharp right turn and the cars is going too fast to recognize that the turn is up ahead, the car comes up to the turn, goes to fast around the turn and starts to slip, the car then overcorrects sending Johnny and all of his friends straight into the side of the mountain.

Now see this would have been no problem had Johnny been paying attention to the road ahead, but he thought that his autonomous car had it all under control. The autonomous car would be a great inovation to driving, but when human nature takes over and we rely too much on the product things such as this may happen.",4
0821b94,"The world of automotive technology is constanly changing for what engineers believe is the best for society. There are always new and improved ideas for cars, but some of them may not be in the best interest for people. The idea of a car that drives itself seems both unreliable and unrealistic. After reading this passage the idea of a self-driving car seems like more of a hassle than the number one item on a person's Christmas list.

The ""driverless"" cars of today are far from not needing drivers. Most cars, like the Toyota Prius, have many sensors within the car. Though these sensors do help alert the driver if the car is out of control, they do not fix the siuation or get themselves out of it. I have been in a Toyota Prius on a dangerous, icey road, and the car did alert the driver when we were out of control, but the car did not correct the situation it rather made a loud beeping noise and had a flashing signal on the dash. These cars are not driving themselves, but instead relying on the drivers to pay attention to their warnings.

Self-driving cars are also a problem when it comes to legal situations. Dr. Werner Huber believes that entertainment while driving is a great idea for drivers who still need to pay attention to the road. So what happens when a driver is distracted and does not adhere to their self-driving car's warnings? Well the same probelm that occurs with drivers every day. There will still be wrecks and deaths. These cars are not making the roads a safer place, but instead making legal situations more confusing by not knowing who is at fault for an accident.

Though these cars have no large, positive effect on society engineers still continue to work every day on them. These cars are not changing what the base of a car is, but are getting plenty of attention for it. Self-driven cars are unachievable, and they do not benefit society in a positive way.",3
ff331cc,"How can we stop pollution from destroying the Earth and everything that  lives inside of it. If we take a look around us we try to save the Earth by recycling things that reusable. Well its not enough, we have to reduce one of the major cause that is making the greenhouse gas increased. Cars are use in our everyday life, to work, to school,and to buy groceries. We use cars for everything and the toxic gases release by cars are killing the Earth. This toxic gases are being release into the air we breath in. This gases are affecting us and the environment the animals live in, but is also affecting the Earth.

We depend on the Earth everyday, when we wake up we expect the sun to shine on our face and the plants expect the light from the sun to observe carbon dioxide and release oxygen, our major source of surviving. 12 percent  of greenhouse gas is due to passenger in Europe, but in the United States  it takes up to 50 percent in cars intensive. For example in Paris, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city from pollution. Almost 4000 drivers were charge for driving their own vehicle instead of any type of transportation on that day. If we really want to change the world and really help our planet we should follow the example of Bogota, Colombia, they set up a program that lead to a car free day, many Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work the result for this was that the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

Saving our planet is not difficult all you got to do is reduce pollution by recycling reusable things, use less energy in you home and use less water. Finally reduce using your own transportation use other things that will make you appreciate Earth for everything she has done for us. We can reduce pollution and greenhouse gas if we set our mind to do it.               ",3

One reason is because we travel. We have gone to China, Italy, and even Greece. We will go so many more places to maybe even England. We would be able to go to a lot more places. With you.

We also deliver animals and food. Our animals include horses and young cows. We need help caring for all of our animals. Caring for our animals means making sure they have been fed and watered every hour.

Also we help people. We give them food and animals. They need that after wars. Its such an adventure.

Just because we help people and do work doesn't mean we don't have fun. On our trips back we play table tenis, baseball and, vollyball. We also do fencing and boxing.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too, but now the scientists are more interesting in venus they want to know more about venus. Numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for human to study. The scientists and

Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system. Venus has some danger for human for example the temperatures would be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions for humans.

NASA is working on other approches to study Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber similutation the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such condition, that mean scients going to explorer Venus.",2
a9e8063,"In the passage ""Driverless cars are coming"", there are many faults, but postive details as well. I am against the driverless cars idea ,because i feel like it has many fault,not really a ""driverless car"",and is not prefected enough.

I am against ""driverless cars"", because its programming has many faults. In the passage they say that""The sensor werent there the computers werent there , and the mapping wasnt there."". That shows that the cars still need a lot of work on becoming ""driverless"" persay. Not only did they have technology issues it has cost issues. The prompt Paragraph 6 States that ""Radar was a device on hilltop that cost 200 million dollars.""it wasnt somthing you could buy at Radio Shack"". The technology that you would need is not cost effective or ready to hit the streets until they get some of the kinks out.

My Second reason for being against ""driverless cars"" is , because the car is really not ""driver less"". in The passage it says"" In fact, none of the cars developed are completely driverless"". the cars need actual humans to assist the car because the car is not programed for traffic or road blocks. Even in the passage it says""This means the human driver must remain alert and be able to take over when a situation require'. You can not simply take a nap and the car will get you to where you need to go you have to say awake and pay attention incase of rerouting.

Thirdly I strong am against the ""driverless car"" because its not perfected enough. The car doesnt abide by the United States laws in more then one State in the passage it states the ""in most states even to TEST a computer driven car is ILLEGAL"". California ,Nevada,Florida and even District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars due to the fact of driving laws. THe main idea of the laws are to keep people safe and not in accidents and hurting others. Even if they were legal it says ""Even if traffic laws change,new laws will be needed in oreder to cover liability in the case of an accident.

In Conclusion ""Driverless cars has many faults, not really a driverless car ,and isn't perfected enought to put on the rode. if the technology fails and somone is injured. Who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer? could you live with creating somthing and somone dies at your fault? its up to you you have to decide.",4
ba76cb5,"I do not think that the new software would be of any use. Yes it is a good idea. But in the artical it gives us an example of if a student is confused or if a student looks mad or angry, the new software would explain the steps over until the student understands. The way I see it for example a student is working on a problem and the see something unusal in the problem and makes a confused face for a least a second the prgram would explain it to them. The student knows how to do the problem and knows how to solve it already but the program brought up step to exaplain it anyway. It would be useless the student could have soveld it already and would have been to the next problem but the Facial Action Coding System got in the students way just to show them how to do something they already know.

In the artical it also tells us to look in a minor or at a friend and make a ""smiling face"". The friend would see that you are happy yes, but we were told to make that face we had no desire to make that face happy or not, we just made the face, it was a forced smile. In the artical also it says that the computer program would be able to tell a force smile from a genuingly happy smile which what I just explaind that a smile is easy to manipulate. The program could be taking in false information and the program itself would not even know it.

In the artical it also exaplains that ads. That if a ad were to pop up and you would smile the prgram would show another ad just like the previous one and visvursa. The real question is have you ever ever seen a ad so many times that you become angry or frustrated and you smile because the ""Skip ad"" timer is getting closer and closer to zero the ""FAC"" would miss-understand your face and bring another ad just like that one. With this program I see very many problems that would not be able to be avoided.

""The new emotion-recognition software tracks facial movements!"" Oh great but world class actors and actresses and pull the fake emotions off like no other. Some people dont show emotion and sometimes can be happy but no show it. with all these muscles in your face it could also mean that the face tracker would miss lead the face expressions. You as might as well have a dog look at you and be able to tell if your happy or not, becuase they are much better at reading face expressions.

It is a really good idea but it can be easily manipulated and also be in the way of varius things. I think it would be much much easier if you were to raise your hand and ask for help or just click a button that has different emotions that you could choose from to tell how you are feeling.",4
c8bec0e,"The last ship to try to land on Venus was three decades ago. Astronots and scientists have been tryong to beat the challenges of Venus. NASA has been working on technology that could survivle the harsh conditions of Venus. They have been testing silicon carbide electronices. NASA been trying to make a blimp-like vehicle that could protecet the astronots that are in it. Scientists have also been working on mechanical computers.

The blimp-like vehicle can be used as a research area as well as a living area for the astronots. It can go higher in the air meaning it can avoid the storm, earthquakes, and erupting volcanoes. NASA has not found a way to use the vehicle to help reasearchers get samples from Venus. Scine they are in the air above the gas clouds it would be hard for researchers to get photography or videography of Venus surface. They have been fooling around with silicon carbide electronics.

NASA and its scientists has been useing silicon carbide electronic in a testing chamber that is set like Venus. This new technology could be used on Venus when NASA figurs out a way to increase the survability time of silicon carbide electronic. They have not figuer it out yet and could be decades before they figer it out. They also have one more item they have been test that is mechanical computers.

We used mechanical computer in 1940s dring World War II. Scientest think that we can make the parts immune to Venus's harsh conditions. They could be made to resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. This is one of the of projects that will hopefuly beat Venus's challenges.

There are three ways NASA has been try to beat Venus challenges. We have yet to try them on Venus. If one of this ways works we have the satitfation of completing the challenge Venus gave us. ",2
079e8bb,"You're living the high life. You have a Driverless Car. What could go wrong? A lot can go wrong. Technology is a grand thing, but it's also a power. If we let it keep accumulating like this we could be in big trouble. Power goes to peoples heads. It's in our nature. We can't let technology over rule us. We need to slow it down. What we have now is grand. What more needs to be done? We don't need to have driverless cars. Soon cars will be like human robots driving wherever they please.

In todays world we have a lot of advanced technology. You watch movies like Back to the Future and Jurassic World. We wonder when will we get that technology? Does it already exist just hidden under out noses? Who really knows. But the point is, is that if we let cars start driving themselves we could get laszy. That's not so good for our social status to the world. Most foreigners already assume we are fat and lazy and get everything handed to us. In some aspects this is true, but with driverless cars on the rise this could get worse.

There's also the fact that what would happen if the car didn't do what it was suppose to do; and it wrecked; and the owner; or a pedestrian got hurt.

This raises a lot of qestions and concerns. The main one would be who was at fault? In paragraph 9 it states that, ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" This is good. Their are a lot of bad drivers in the worlds, but they know what to do in most cases. They know how to take control.

The practice of driveless cars are illegal in most states. Those states being California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. It's good that most states are thinking ahead. Why would something so fascinating and new be illegal to practice? They care about their people, and their safety.

In paragraph 7, it states that there are cars that are partially driverless. One being the 2013 BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car is a smart car. It works with the owner not just by itself. The BMW can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but it notifies the owner when it needs human assitance. This is all wrong. Cars shouldn't be doing that. Cars are going to become more human than technology.

In a lot of cases it's okay to have advanced technology. But this is too much. We need to start thinking about what will happen instead of what we will gain out of it. Think of what would go wrong. As the world advances we need to rememeber who exactly is in charge. This is why if we leave technology to do our work, it won't even be us anymore. We will be living in technologies world; not the world we worked so hard to build. This is why we need not let driveless cars come in to existance.           ",3
102a358,"I honestly think that having driverless cars are not a very smart idea. i mean, how will kids know that our generation use to manually drive around with our hands and feet. Also the enjoyment we had doing so.

The google cars they have made that are able to drive on their own can make a human being lazy beacuse the driver would be effortless to drive around and could let their car drive. People can talk about how drivers can fall asleep while manually driving. But how about these google cars? They said in the article that a google car can drive on its own , BUT it can still alert the driver to take control of the car when its around complicated traffic , such as navigating through roadworks or accidents. If the google car was meant to be driverless it would not have to alert the driver to take control in situations it was built and designed for. So the driver should not be alerted to do such a thing. I think we should keep driving the way we are today. Drivers are more focused driving themselves instead of being lazy , because no driver wants to get in an accident themselves. So they're more alert and have better drivning experience everyday they drive to a certain destination. Also the senors we have today are more enough because they alert us when another car is to close to us. We do not have to be alerted when to drive. I do think that we need better brakes that will not be worn out or broken. But instead people want to make driverless cars. How about making cars that dont have to run on gas or be to costly ? Indistructable tires? Car glass that don't break? Airbags that don't harm or knock people out? All of these harms and they are worried about how to establish a driverless car.

The car can alert you to take control, but what if you forget some of your driving expirence or get startled? Also what would happen if the car does not alert the driver? Can it alert the driving if the tires need more air pressur? Or an oil change ? I think that should be something to conern about the just making future drivers lazy to drive around. I honestly think that having driverless cars in the future are even more dangerous than the cars we use today.   ",3

9e599a1,"Many people have heard of the ""Face"" of Mars. My friend and I were arguing about if it was ancient bona fide evidence of life on Mars, or a natural landform. We argued a bit, but he finally believed me after i told him the real facts. Here is my evidence of the ""Face"" being a natural landform.

Beggining with the first image ever uploaded on the ""Face"", many believed the ""Face"" to be some sort of alien artifact. NASA stated it was a rock formation, and this would be proved over a period of years. Firstly, when the picture was taken, scientist thought it could have been an ancient artifact, but then found out it was just a mesa, but with unusual shadows to give its appearance. This is stated in all of paragraph 2,

""There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" Next, much better photos were taken, almost 18 years after the original image! This is stated in this sentence, ""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his MArs Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.""

Finally, a final picture, taken in 2001, was the key to finishing the research and to prove it was just a mesa, beggining with ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" and is also stated in ""So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!.""

Nevertheless, the controversial photo was disproven. This shows how much a popular photo can become a question science can, or cannot, answer. So it is finally over and done with, the ""Face"" was actually a mesa with a shadow, taken at the perfect time to show a face.",3

8fe06d7,"The author doesn't fully support his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. He displays too many downsides of the exploration. He frequently brings up how risky it could be. The benefits are acknowledged, but briefly. The author spends too much time focusing on how the conditions are far from easy when he should have been focusing on why traveling to Venus is worth it. His idea is that the trip is worth it, but most of his writing describes why it is not.

The author first brings up the environment of the planet. He describes the hot temperatures, stating how it averages to be over 800 degress Farenheit. He also adds in how it has the hottest surface, despite Mercury being closer to the sun. This is obviously way too hot for human beings. Then, he discusses that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times stronger than that on Earth. This environment is much more extreme that anything we're used to. Plus, Venus experiences earthquakes, lightning, and volcanoes that are way more powerful than the ones on Earth. The author provides information on all the reasons why our species could not live there.

Furthermore, he admits that NASA does not even have the needed equipment to safely and effectively travel to Venus. He only mentions that they are currently working on it. The author gives the idea that Venus could be studied from up above, in a vehicle hovering miles away from the surface. This way, scientists could get an insight on what's going on down there. However, doing that would prevent seeing most light, since it isn't able to penetrate the atmosphere. Even though the author does say better approaches are being worked on, no machines are completely ready. We simply don't have the required technology to keep humans safe on their expedition.

Finally, the author doesn't support his claim that going to Venus is worth it because the pros of traveling there are kept at a minimum. In his writing, he failed to give important reasons on why going there is essential. He does bring up that it's fascinating to astronomers due to how similar it could have been to Earth long ago. However, the potential similarity it could share is not a reason to risk lives to explore it. Yes, it is beneficial to study planets other than ours, but when it's so dangerous, it shouldn't be done. If the author wants to convince people that the pursuit should be taken even though it is unsafe, he should list more reasons why than just the fact that it's fascinating.

To conclude, the author poorly explained the reasoning to his arguement. He spent too much time hightlighting all the dangers presented. He should have gave readers better valid points to travel to Venus. Instead, he repeatedly wrote about the extreme conditions, or the lack of proper technology. Too much time was spent on the wrong side of his claim. The author should have supported his idea with reasons other than just pure curiousity. The cons outweigh the pros. ",5
a2a5ab9,"I belive that the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) would be good to use in school because like it says in the article a teacher would know when a student is bored, and they could change the lesson up a little bit, to make it more interseting. It seems like it would be a good tool to use in school.

The Facs could help students who dont normally ask the teacher for help get help. The system could recognize if a student was lost or confused on the thing they're working on. The teacher could then go to that student and help them with that problem they are on, and it might lead to them asking questions in the future because they might feel comfortable asking that teacher for help. It could also help guidance counsolers find the depressed or mad kids, and help them with their problems. The machine knows your mixed emotions which is great because a student might look like they get the problem they're working on, but really they need help and the teacher can recognize that , and get the tudent the help they need on it. It's pretty cool that a computer can consturct a 3-D model of your face, and to get all 44 facial muscles to move along with it.

In conclusion the FACS would be very helpful to schools but it's probally very expensive, but i'm sure if someone were to make a claim to a school board committe, the committe would find funding for it if enough people were on board with it. This machine would help in school by knowing how the students feel while they're at school, and knowing what students understand, and don't understand can help the teachers change up the lessons for their future students they teach.",3
42d86ef,"Many people believe that driving makes everything easier since it gets you from point A to point B. But so does walking or riding a bike. There are many advantages to limiting car usage all over the world. Limiting car usage not only decreases the problem of smog or greenhouse gas emission it also helps give back to the economy in different ways.

Limiting car usage helps decrease any sort of problem with smog or greenhouse gas emission. As stated in Source 2, ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(10). Since Paris decided to enforce the ban, the smog had cleared enough Monday for the French party to rescind the ban on Tuesday. Thus proving the point that limiting car usage either through a ban or just a vehicle-free zone, as in Germany, it can reduce smog and/or greenhouse gas emission. Greenhouse gas emission can be reduced simply by either switching to a more economy efficient car such as the hybrid or creating a low-car surburban society. As stated in Source 1, ""Passenger cars are resposible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.""(5).Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza asserted that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution""(Source 3,24) demonstrating that more than one person agree that lowering the use of cars is good for any society.

Economy may get better but it might just all depend on whether or not society begins to limit their car usage. As car usage is decreasing, people now have time to go out and be care free. As they stop limiting themselves from just driving from one place to another, more opportunities arise. Places such as ""parks and sport centers also have bloomed throughout the city""(Source 3, 28) because people now have the time,instead of being stressed,to go have fun. Now new restaurants and even upscale shopping districts have cropped up, these places are being placed because of the restriction on driving your car. Even though it may have ""negative implications for the car industry""(Source 4,34) our economy will be boosted leaving the negative implications for car industry out of the question when it comes to advantages versus disadvantages. People will have stores within walking distance and since there will be suburbs with car-free zones it makes communication easier and faster, leaving driving places from stressing anyone out.

Everything isnt always dependent on time and if you have to work, with these suburbs containing car-free zones, stores are only a walk away instead of ""along some distant highway""(Source 1,6). As mentioned in Source 3 ""the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog""(21) and with limited car usage it is guaranteed that this will occur. Even though cars may be needed, there are many more efficient ways of achieving something without using your car. America has already joined in reducing their driving percentage by either using environment friendly cars or not receiving a license at all. Places all over the world believe the limiting of vehicles in their society supports their country thus a low-car society is what it takes to ""conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety""(Source 4, 43).

umasking the face on mars were not crated by aliens.Long long time ago when you were not born .there are thing you never know in the outer spaces .Even today we don't know how the outer space work .We only know how it look like.

Secondly,we may not know that the rock in outer space might hit it .When you look at the picture that was snapping photed of possible landing ,I can see that it look like butte or mesa landform.So the question many people ask ""did the aliens do that"" the answe is no because a group of scientist and I went out of the outer space to take picture and search for alien but we don't see any alien,we also do lot of research and stay at the outer space for a long time, even at night.I also want to tell you this story that unmasking the face on mars is a natural landform. Long time ago my dad once told me unmasking the face on mars .It happen once a year and soon it will go away.He had told me a one of the scientist had discovery that it was a butte or mesa landform but he die because the oxygen were gone and he could't breath anymore.After he died nobody had the evidence to prove that it was a butte or mesa landform.Today people are being fool because of the face on mars.When you look at the article it even say ""what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landform comon aroud the American "".

In conclusion there are no such as alien and I claim that the umasking the face on mars is just the natural landform.",2

All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.

"" As an official of the Transportation for America, David Goldberg is a credible source for information regarding transportation in America. However there are places all around the world were automobiles are causing problems. Limiting car usage could help solve many of those issues.

In America, the topic of alternative transportation has been  discussed many times, but in previous bills, 80% of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20% to other transport. This can be found in paragraph 9 of the first source as the fifth line. Sadly America is not the only country having problems. In

Paris, France , diesel cars make up 67% of the vehicles and the diesel feul is blamed for the smog accumulation in the city. In Paris, A warmer layer of air caused by cold nights and warm days, trapped the car emissions which then caused a five day period of intensifying smog. France's smog build-up rivaled that of

Beijing, China , which is claimed to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. This problem also exists in the States, as transportation is the second largest cause of America's emissions, right behind power plants. To ensure safety anyone who was still driving their car was fined 22- euros or $31.

Bogota, Columbia followed France in their violation fee and charged any violater $25. Bogota has created a

Day Without Cars , in which no cars are used, to promote alternative transport and the reduction of smog levels. Another positive effect no cars can have would be a more peaceful enviroment, as stated in sources 1 and 3. In America, recent studies show that Americans have been buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. Although it may be far in the future, America may soon follow the lead of

Vauban, Germany , where it is completely car-free. This probably won't happen anytime in the near future, but the use of automobiles has gone down in the United States. Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor company, proposed a city in which, pedestrians, bicycles, private cars, etc. are used to save time, lower emissions and improve safety. He sees this future, hopefully others will too.

Although America might not be exactly like Vauban, it is good to hope that it will get there someday. No cars would result in a calmer atmosphere and a more peaceful lifestyle. Also, it would lower the emissions made by vehicles, which in turn would save the atmosphere, thus saving life on earth. No cars would also help improve safety, both of animals and of people. We may not be completely there yet, but the world will someday have no need for cars and that will be the first step into the future.    ",2
7e8b33f,"I'd have to say the new technology ''Facial action coding system'' that has been created in Illionois is acceptable. It beyond helpful in my perspective it could really help out young children whom don't understand what the teacher is saying. '' A classroom computer could recgonize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then modify the lesson like an effective human instructor''. This quote states how it the new technology is being used. Especially children who dont understand english. Without saying anything verbally to the computer, and it could help some students outs! It would be extra heplful if it had that ability to translate. The reason why I am saying this because there are some whom don't want to speak and are simply quite and usually just give a face in which the compter can caculate you. And the fact that we humans preform the same expression'' as said in paragraph 5. Inconclusion this would probably help out the students who dont speak for them selves. And increase the ability for young children to be stress free and more understanding in what subject they are currently learning and hopefully be sucessful.",2
00eabc5,"Just Straight FACS

Anybody can read a room. Whether it's at a party, an important meeting, a funeral, or a Pre-Calculus lesson at 8 a.m., it's easy to look around and see how the people around you are feeling due to body language and facial expression.

Others don't think so, though. Prof. Thomas Huang and his team of experts have come up with new tech that can recognize all 44 muscles in the human face, and create a diagnostic on how a person is feeling. This is interesting, yes, but some may think that this technology could be used in classrooms to get a general feel on what each student is feeling about a lesson.

I believe that using the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) in a classroom setting would have no merit and would just be a waste of time and money in public schools across America, because of how weak the technology in the FACS actually is.

In the text, Dr. Huang says that ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" and that ""varying degrees of expression"" can still be used to recognize the feelings and emotions of any human being. When applying this to a classroom enviroment, this can't be correct. That is due to many natural factors in humans.

For example, the world has progressed a lot, and more children with mental disabilities and special needs are being allowed to be involved in regular classes. For a student with a form of autism, it may be hard for them to convey certain emotions on a regular basis. The technology wouldn't be able to read their face correctly. Another example is for a student with a physical disability whose face couldn't be read properly by the FACS. There are too many outliers for the technology to be accurate, unless you had a room of children who all express their emotions like an open book.

The text also says that ""most human communications are nonverbal."" I agree with this statement, actually. It proves that one can never tell what a person is thinking just by what they say, or their facial expressions. The only true place you can know how somebody really feels is in their mind. I, for one, never really say or express how I feel about school infront of any sort of teacher or staff. It's a general rule among students at my school to onlt talk about teachers or lessons outside of the classroom. Now, this may not be how it is in other public school settings. If it happened to, though, then the FACS technology would be obsolete in its purpose.

Lastly, in paragraph 9, the text says that according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, ""putting on a face"", or a poker face, actually trains your body to be in a better mood. This means that literally anyone could trick the FACS into thinking that they were in a happy mood when need be. Students could easily ""beat the system"" by manipulating the FACS into giving off a false diagnostic every time, and therefore ruining the FACS's credability. Until the FACS can tell when a group of teenagers are faking their emotions, it can't perform its main task.

In conclusion, Dr.Huang's FACS technology cannot work due to how baseless it's ethics are, how difficult it really is to understand emtions just by facial expression, and how easy it is to manipulate it's process.",4
4edad23,"Driverless cars are indeed a thing of the future but are they really practical? We should stick with human operated vehicles instead of computer operated vehicles. If we switch to computer operated vehicles, soon we will no longer teach generations to drive, we will begin to rely on these computers to take us everywhere. This will turn into a problem when something happens to the computer in the car and we are left in a car that we dont know how to drive. Peoples lives could become endangered becasue they are clueless on how to drive. Also, if a person does get imjured would it be the manufacturers fault or the person driving the car manufacturer. Legal battles will erupt and new laws will have to be made. Convenience is also an issue, in order to get from one destination to another you will have to input it in the car, but what if you need to make a pit stop or you get hungry, you have to completely reroute the car and try to find the address of the nearest gas station or resturant.

0c442a8,"Venus is often known as the more dangerous 'twin' of Earth. It is located two planets away from the Sun but is hotter than Mercury, the planet next to the sun, even with it being further away. Although Venus is similar to Earth in size and a few other things, thick sheets of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid coat the earth, making it very difficult to research. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author presents reasons why Venus should be researched, despite the precautions scientists would have to take.

Visiting Venus does not indicate a need to be on the planet's surface. When thinking about being on and researching a planet, individuals would think about what it would be like to be visiting ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"" (3). A solution made by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration claims they could possibly send scientists to Venus but instead of landing, they would ""float above the fray [of Venus]"" (5). This would allow scientists to do some more research on the difficult planet and keeping them safer by only introducing them to ""170 degrees Fahrenheit"" and ""air pressure [that] would be close to that of sea level on Earth"" (5). NASA is already introducing ideas that are very noteworthy and realistic for more exploration on the planet Venus.

Researchers are building machines and working innovatively to allow more time in Venus for further research. Years ago, rovers and spacecrafts were sent to Venus but ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" (2). This information helps conclude how dangerous the planet is and how cautious scientists, researchers, and astronauts would have to be to visit or study more on. In recent years, NASA has worked more on building an electronic device completed with silicon carbide that ""lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" when ""tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface"" (7). This brings another level of excitement for the future of planet exploration because it extends the 'life expectancy' of the spacecraft. Some researchers have also been working on an old mechanical computer technology used in the 1800-1990s. They believe this may be effective on Venus because ""mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" (7) rather than more modern technology, which tends to be more fragile. The future of machines that could orbit Venus is worth pursuing for information and it may be a game-changer for all occupations wanting to learn more about the planet itself.

Although there are many valuable reasons as to why Venus is worth studying for, the author includes some evidence that indicate why Venus exploration is not succeeding as well. It is evident that the planet is clearly not accustomed for human settlement. The author reveals to the audience that ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"" (3). This explains why a person has not visited and how deathly it would be if someone did. While the author explains how humans can explore even just above the clouds of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid, there is also evidence that ""most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"" (6). Despite these facts given, the article ends with ""our travels onEarth and beyond should not be limited by dangerous and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (8) and this contributes to why visiting Venus is worth it, making all the reasons against visiting less effective because they are not explained as thoroughly throughout.

Even with all the evidence and reasoning behind why the earth is too dangerous to study, the author believes Venus is a worthy pursuit as it is a challenge for the future of space exploration. Scientists and researchers have all the information they need to figure out a plan so they can pursue active studying on the planet Venus. With all precautions aside, Venus is worth spending time on if they can figure out how to do it effectively without too many troubles and hassles. ",5
fcd7af0,"There has been a new breakthrough in computer facial recognition software. This breakthrough is called the Facial Action Coding System, also known as the FACS. The FACS is a facial recongnition software that is used to determine someone or something's emotions. In the article, this software is used on the Mona Lisa, to determine that she is eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and two percent angry. Some people beleive that this software could be useful in classroms, and i agree to an extent. This software would not be as useful to students in a traditional brick and mortar school as it would to somebody taking an online schooling program. I am an online school sudent and the FACS could be helpful in several ways.

The first way that this software could be helpful to a student would be detecting if they are bored. Much like a teacher would, if this software noticed that a student was bored during class, it could take action to engage the student more. An example of this could be if a student was simply reading through a lesson, and became disinterested. The computer could then suggest that the student watch a video on the subject instead. This would bring the student a different type of lesson, and slightly change up their day to engage them more.

Another way that this software could be useful in an online schooling program is it could detect when its students were feeling frustrated. If a student is feeling frustrated, then the software could take action against that, having the student either take a break, or putting the student in contact with a teacher so that they could work through the subject together. This would help the program have a better graduation rate, as it would help struggling students.

The final way that the FACS could be useful is to detect if a given student was sad. There is a rising problem among students, and that problem is mental illness. The most common mental illness is depression, and this program could help with that on some cases. The FACS could help by detecting that the student is sad, and alerting the student's parents, or possibly even a teacher to get in contact with the student, and talk with them about their emotions. This system is obviously not perfect, but it could help detecting early signs of depression among students.

Overall, the FACS could be very useful to an online schooling program. The software could be used to detect if a student is bored, if a student is frustrated, or even if a student was sad. These are all of the reasons that the FACS would be helpful in an online schooling program.",4
ea158b1,"A classroom with the use of this technology would be a classroom of supieriority. This new techonology could greatly improve students´ abilities to learn. Often students are protrayed as being happy or content during a lesson, but really, they are confused. The FACS, Facial Action Cosing System, is an advanced piece technology that can help students with their school work and can be very valuable in the classroom.

The FACS is a computer coding system that allows computers to be able to read the facial expressions of humans. According to the passage, the process in which the computer recognizes the feelings of a human begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face. Each and every muscle movement of the face can detect the exact emotions of any person. For example, the zygomatic major, a muscle that begins at the cheek bones, lift the corners of the mouth when someone is genuinly happy. The FACS system is incredible at calculating any person's emotions and can cause the computer to adapt to anyone's liking.

It is not unusual for a student to ""fake"" their way through a lesson just to make it seem like they are ""okay"" when really they are misunderstanding everything that is being taught. According to the passage, this new techonology system is able to recognize the facial expressions of students as they work through an assignment on the computer. It interprets if the student is understanding the material or not. Through a slight frowny face or a confused face, the computer can tell that the student is not able to comprehend what is going on. In return, the computer program may change the lesson to make it slightly easier on the student until it detects a content face. This face will trigger the computer so that it is able to recognize that the student is now understanding the lesson. The program can act as an individual instructor for each student in order for the student to meet their needs.

From this technology, the student will not only have an advantage, but the teacher will as well. Instead of individually tying to speak to kids if they need help, the computer can do it for them. Sometimes, it can get tough and frustrating for a teacher to try to meet the needs of each unique student. With the help of the technology, students can obtain their specific needs on their own. This will relieve a great deal of stress that teachers may carry on their shoulders, and would be very beneficial towards them.

The FACS is a valuable piece of technology that can assist many in the classroom. Lessons will be adapted to meet the students needs when they are confused, becasue the facial recognition program will pick up on their moods. Also, teachers will no longer need to try to teach the lesson several different ways for each different student to understand it. This program greatly advances the students´ learning and acts as a helping hand for teachers.       ",5

bb2ea78,"Dear State senator,

The Electoral college is a process that was established by our founding fathers in a constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.The electoral college consists of the selection of the electors then that carries into the meeting or gathering of the electors.In that type of meeting of the electors they vote for the president and the vice president,Next is the counting of the electoral votes by congress.The electoral college consists of 538 electors,Did you know that a majority of those elector's votes are required to elect the president.Well 270 electoral votes to be exact.Well how did the number of electorals get chosen? The way that exact number got chosen is because tehere is one electoral to each member in the House of Representatives.Don't you agree that that was a wise choice? Also dont you think that our founding fathers really sat back and but real thought and effort in to a decision like this,something to put into the constitution.

Personally,I believe that the Ellectoral College should be kept in place and not depend on a popular vote to elect our president,for two reasons.The first reason is because most people who are about to vote they dont actually sit and take the time to see who they are voting for,they just ""christmas tree"" all of the options that they have. The second reason why i believe that i believe that the electoral college should stay in place because that this is a good process to have in place.

How many people do you think actually sit there and research and put thought into the president that they are chosing to run their country? Do you really belive that everyone does that? Think about the young and inexperienced voters who are fresh out of highschool and probaly just getting into college,Do you think that on top of their school work that they'll sit there and add something else on to their plate? To be completly honest i would not. I would either not vote or just pick at a random.Many people have a family and a job or jobs and have alot on their plate so the last thing they're gonna do is take the time out of their busy schedules and researchand find information on something that they dont need to do.

I also believe that the electoral college should stay in place because it's a good process to have. Having the electoral college in effect takes the stress off of the voters so they can continue on with their busy lives and not have to stand in those unreasonably long lines in the cold,hot,rain, or even snow. The people workers out in those lines are irritable and dont want to be there along with the voters,They look at it as a a waist of their time. No one likes to feel like their time was waisted because ""Time is Money"".

I hope you actually get this letter,read it,and but thought into what you just read.The Electoral college is a very good process to have in effect. Remeber that it keeps peole stress free and less irritable and if you use the Electors and not citizens you will end up getting a more educated vote because they sat back and analyzed the actions from the past of each canadate that is running and is making a vote based off of knowledge,not picking at a random.

aff6bdc,"I think that they should have more people join/help with the Seagoing Cowboys program.

I think they should have more peoople beacuse then it will incluse having more help instead of having so many animals with not so amny opeople. For example, if you had ten/10 cows and one/1 person then it would be harder . But if you had al least five/5 people helping then you would have half as many which might/would have a big effect on how much more help is nedded/wanted.

What if you put it at a diffrent point/thought. As in, what if those cows and horses were going to little kids? And they were for example going to use them for 4-H because if then would it make other people want to join? For the kids sake? Would you think that would make more people join? More people help? More people to ""get involved""?

I think if we brought it to people's attention that, joining this could possibly ""save an animal"". If you really think about it you could even save a farm, because cows produce milk and some poeple cant even afford milk and thing that you could get from these animals that are in this program. The following problem about the farm.

And a cool part about helping would be you could go overseas if you join the program. And if you have a mind like Luke then, as qouted in this passage "" I would be glad to have this opertunity. And another great benifit out of helping/joining, is as said in the story, ""Table-Tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and alson games to help times to pass by.

""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs"". And if you think about it with this being quoted/said in the passage it could teach people a real lesson about others inneed of others help. So this could be

FACS should be in classroom because we need to know how if you and a good or bad mood, counselor, and if your getting bully and your not happy about it.

Classroms should have the Facial Action Coding System so the teacher can know if you are in a good or bad mood because some people dont show it. Teachers need to know how their students are feeling because they might call on them in class to answer a qusetion not knowing that the student is in a bad to answer the quwstion. In the text it states,"" Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" This quote support my answer because its hard to tell if a person upset or need time to be alone so he or she can cool down. Having a FACS computer in classroom will really help teahers know if there something upsetting there students.

Having a Facial Action Coding System in classrom would help conselor know if you go to there office and your not showing no emotion but your upset about something. The technogly can be helpful to many school because teachers do not know whats going on with there students because they dont show it or try to talk to somebody about it.

This technogly could help students that are getting bully and are afriad to speak up and tell a teacher. Students that get bully everyday at school are most likely do not tell nobody that they are getting bully because they are afriad of the person that are doing the mean things to the student. Having the Facial Action Coding System can help the student that getting bully seek out help before it gets worse then it already is. In the text it states,""But in a false smile, the mout is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. to an expect, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are something used to spot when a ""smiling"" politcian or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This quote supports my quote because it can help a teacher know if her or his student is upset about something and he or she can ask the student so it he be stop.

Facial Action Coding System should be in school because it can be helpful for teachers to know if your in a good or bad mood , letting your counsoler if you upset about something, and also if your getting bully. This technolgy is a great way to know if something going on at home. Many student would proabbly ant this kind of computer because they would be scared to tell somebody how they are feeling.

82a9cbf,"I do not agree with the whole driverless car thing. To start off it is dangerous. The idea that the person has to always be alert defeats the purpose of it being driverless. Also the alerts to get the drivers attention should not be needed. I mean if someone creates a driverless car they should actually make it so it is, in fact, driverless.

On long road trips I get that one person has to drive the whole time, and yes the driver could get tired and want to take a nap. This would be good for them but even if the driver were to go to sleep and be awaken to an accident in front of them. You cannot expect a human that has been sleeping to be completely in control of what is going on at the time. Who knows, they might freak out and run into something else. There are so many possibilities that something could go horribly wrong with driverless car.

Yes, I know almost everyone expects to have all this new technology in the future. All I think about is the movie Wall-E and how they had their own floating chairs and everyone was fat and lazy. Is that really how we want the world to end up. America is already one of the most obese countries. Making it so people do not have to drive is taking away from at least some of the excercise they could have.

Overall I think the driverless cars are a bad idea. Not only will there be more accidents because people are not always going to be watching the road and they will not have to rely on a machine, if they just drove themselves. Whoever makes a car that could go driverless will almost never make it completely driverless. There will always be something else to add on to it.     ",3

79f27ad,"Society has made the car industry accelerate rapidly and over the years the amount of money these automobile company's make only increases. However, its time to look into the advantages of limiting such car usage in our communities. Studies have shown that the use of cars only increases the amonunt of stress we have. Without the usage of cars we're able to release such stressors Carlos Arturo Plaza stated in Andrew Selsky's article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". Its one thing to make the decision to start this movement on our own, but when a community becomes involved it makes a stronger impact. Car usage in America has only grown since it began however, the amount of cars being bought is beginning to show decrease. Many people are realizing that there are numerous amounts of ways to get around their city. Some are even carpooling. Although choosing other options such as the bus may take time it is still well worth the wait. We will find that many other options and opportunities come into play when we cut down on and get rid of the use of cars in our communities.

Various factors come into play when it comes to world pollution. One of the factors being the use of automobiles which increases the amount of air pollution thus damaging the ozone layer. The use of cars is second nature to us. We love the sense of indepence we get at the age of 16 when we can finally get our license. To point out, no one thinks on whats happening as we purchase cars. Instead, we rely on diesel gas to do the trick. Imagine cutting out the use of cars. With this detuction of car usage the amount of destruction done to the ozone layer will diminish tremendously. We will be able to experience clearer air just like the communities that participate in this action. For instance, in an article done by Robert Duffer titled ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" we can witness through testimony the wonders done by banning car usage. Normally Paris has high amounts of pollution but in order to change this the city enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air temporarily. The fact that the city had cold nights and warm days doesn't do anything to help because these nights and days only allow for the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. After the banning of car usage Paris was finally able to experience clear air. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... Last week Paris had 147 ,micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with the 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London... "" (excerpt from source 2 ""Paris bans driving due to smog"").

To be clear, no one's against car usage, but after considering the costs of using cars you'd realize its not worth it. Residents of Vanban, Germany find this statement to be true and have therefore regulated their lives around it. Elizabeth Rosenthal created an article on the residents from Germany titled ""In German Suburb, Life Goesn On Without Cars"". Here she discussed what the community has done in their no car movement. Residents here do not regret their decision to get rid of their cars and actually like it better than dealing with the uncontrollable and frustrating traffic jams. Not to mention the countless amount of car wrecks that come along with it. In this particular part of Germany the government has assisted in the movement. There are no street parking spots, driveways or home garages. Some might think its absurd but when theres no cars theres no need for such things. They have even improved sidewalks and made the city commute friendly with stores only a walk distance away. A mother from Germany gives her account of living in Vauban and states the following: ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" She is a media trainer and a mother of two. In previous bills, 80 percent of the money from the government had gone to highways and 20 percent to other transports, but with the smart planning movement that will change within the next 6 years.

All in all, many factors come into play when discussing transportation within a city. However with the deduction of car use a city can recieve many benefits including an increase in money for other government spending, clearer air, happiness, more money in their pockets among many other things. We just have to decide whether enough is enough. The facts have proven themselves worth it for many other countries, why can't it be successful for us as well?    ",5
7d4cb22,"I think that driverless cars would be a good idea.

The reason I think driverless cars would be a good idea because they wouldn't have to take gas, you wouldn't have to steer them, you wouldn't even have to have your foot on a pedle, you also wouldn't have to put your hands on the steering wheel and hold them there while you are driving. Driverless cars would dirve themselfs so you didn't have to. Driverless cars might also be a bad idea because something can function out and someone could get hurt really bad. But I still think that driverless cars is a good idea and we should have them. Now if something does go out in it, and you have a wreck or something you might die, or be injuried pretty badly. Think of the positive side you wouldn't have to steer the car because it would that it's self, you wouldn't have to put gas in it because its driverless, you wouldn't have to keep your foot on the gas pedle because the car would move automatically, and you wouldn't have to have your hands on the steering wheel because the car would steer it's self so therfor I think driverless cars would be a good idea. I think I would get a driverless car.

Now that I have spoken what I feel about driverless cars, what do you think about them? Do you think they are a goodf or bad thing? Would you have a driverless car?",1
728699e,"My possition on driverless cars is, they are not a good idea. First of all people will try to sleep and or do something else that will distract them and it could possibly be a threat to road workers or pedestrians. Then if it does hit someone, paragraph 8 talks about who will be to blame? I personaly think that the driver would be to blame because he or she should be paying attention at all times to ensure nothing will happen.

What if it runs out of gas, or even has a mechanical problem? Will it completely crash into things or even people? Thats probably the biggest worry on the driverless cars to me. What if your were to get in a accident? The car my still try and go, causing even more damage!

In the past companys have been able to make self driving cars that had not made a single accident. In the early 50's or 60's Pontiac made a car that succesfully mad 5 laps around a closed corse without a single error! With the advance ments since then i think we should be able to make a car driverless, with new technology we should be able to make a full proof car by know, right? The only way i think they should be allowed is if they are one hundred percent full proof with absolutily no errors when in beta testing, with people out on the track to make sure there is no problems with pedestrians or road workers.

I think in the near future a self driving car is absolutly possible, and to have and afford by the common person.",3

62f2013,"America's great past time might now be just that, in the past. This isn't baseball though, it's the usage of our American vehicles. America was the frontrunner in the invention of cars and has the motor capital of the world in Detroit. However, We've come a long way since the model T and now it is time to move forward into a new, cleaner era of transportation. Cities all across the world have begun the process of minimzing the  usage of private motor vehicles to help stop pollution, and to encourage the use of public transportation. The trend is already upon us in America as well, as a study showed that between 2001 and 2009 the amount of young people driving has decreased by 23 percent. Life without cars has proven beneficial to many cities around the world and it is time to spread to all cities.

First off, limiting the usage of cars will vastly decrease the amount of pollution to our environment.  Recently in Paris, France the government banned all drivers with odd license plates on the first day and all even number plates the second during a two day effort to minimize the smog and pollution of the city. This method proved to be very effectiveas the capital decreased its congestion by 60 percent. This little experiment may seem like a very small accomplishment, but it should serve to be the precedent by which other countries can help stop pollution. If this was done once evry month in major cities around the world it would cause a major decrease in pollution. In the long term it shows people that having their own car isn't always necessary and it is better for the environment to use public tranportation, and or other means to get to one's destination. Bogota, Colombia also participated in their second anual car-free day. This was considered to be a huge success by their mayor and many other South American leaders came to witness it themselves. They were all thouroughly impressed by the programs effectiveness and have thought about implementing it in their own countries.

Secondly, limiting car usage will result in different city layouts that could prove to be more desirable and efficient. In Vauban, Germany they have decided to go nearly car free with 70 percent of residents not owning a car. Car ownership is allowed but the owner of the vehicle must buy a space in a large parking garage for 40,000 dollars. Many of the residents claim that they lived a more stressful life when they owned a car and are now much happier because of the sale of their vehicle. This has started a trend in Europe of small suburban communities going car free to help the environment and their lives. This shift into a car free world is sparking the idea for new city designs to make them denser so mit is easier for people to travel from place to place. Stores can be placed only a walk away on a main street as opposed to a large shopping mall that is along a large highway.

In conclusion, limiting the use of cars and motor vehicles would prove to be extremely benficial for our world and our society. It would help solve the pollution and global warming crisis by limiting the amounts of carbon dioxide we put into our atmosphere. It would also change the shape of our suburban life, making it easier for people to get from place to place while still maintaining their green lifestyle. An Earth without cars becomes an Earth with a more peaceful environment and a healthy atmosphere.    ",5
ae11a0c,"Using technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable, beacuse if a teacher wantes to see if the students are understanding the subject that the teacher is teaching it is faster and easier to use this technology. And by doing so the teacher can find new ways to teach the class in a more understanding way. This technology can also be used to teach class about the human face for anybody who wants to be a doctor for that. And it can teach students on how to program This is why this type of technology should be in schools all around the country.

Going on with the idea of new teaching meitheds that the teachers can do. Theachers can show their students more about the human emotions than before. Theachers can show students on how to code new emotions and expressions in the already exesting program. Computer programing is hard to do if someone doesn't know anything about programing, and the students might just give up and do something else. But by experenting with the FACS code it might make things more understandable for the students and more exciting. Then that is opening up more corears for the students to pick from.

In conclusion, is having this technology in classrooms good for both the students and the teachers, the answer is yes. The reason is that the teachers can use it to read the faces of the students to see if they are understanding the lessons or not. The technology can also be used as a new way to teach a subject, like for students trying to become doctors that work on human faces. It can also be a gateway to get students excitied about computer programing.",3

He wants to see if anything is drowing and if life is possible. There is one challenge and that is that no one want to go explore venus because its a har risk to take.

People dont want risk life for somethin not possibe. He wants to explore venus cause its a nice planet ad looks like a bueatiful place to visit someday. People dont know how long they can last on a planet that they are not use to every day. They dont know that if its possibe to travel that far.

Venus is closer to the sun than earth is. There is also acid on venus thats why its so hard to travel to venus. The space shuttle wont be able to penetrate through the clouds that surround venus. Scientist also found out that venus is so hot compared to all of the other planets in the solar system. Still scientist is looking for ways so one day someone will be able to visit venus and explore what is happening on venus.",1
dbcda24,"Many car companies are working on driverless cars. There are many pros and cons of driverless cars. Driverless cars is a very debatable topic. Some believe they can change the world with these cars.

I believe that this idea is completely unnecessary. The money could be put to much better use than having driverless cars. In the 1950s GM created a car that ran on a special test track. The track had special roads that worked with special cars. To make this work they would have to upgrade roads. Though the idea worked well, the idea was too expensive to fund.

The driver assists, like special breaks and motion sensors are a good idea, but not driveless cars. Some pros of having driverless cars are, people wouldn't have to pay attention to the road and do what they want while in the car. Sure it would make life easier. Think about when a teenager first gets their license. Most don't know their way around everywhere. With a regular car, I think it would be better for them to drive around and get familiar with their environment. If they had a driverless car, they wouldn't really pay attention to where they're going. So if the car was to malfunction, they wouldn't know where they're going. Also if an accident were to occur, it would be hard to tell who is at fault.

I think driverless cars are a bad idea, because they're unnecessary. It will be another product for rich people. Also i think it will be a safely hazard. ",3
f2c95f1,"Think about it, people all over the world are constantly getting themselves stuck in natural disasters losing lots of the things they need to survive. In passage 2 it says, "" To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more''.

All this does is help recover families who have lost family members animals or shelter. most of the people cant survive without their food. Being a seagoing cowboy can be more than helping families but can spread the love and hope of God. In passage 9 it sais "" But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him."" Im grateful for the opportunity'' he says.""

Now think if you were in this situation, wouldnt you want to have hope, know someone cares, restore the broken. It would also be challenging to try to live without food no to animals to even rely on for food. Think of someoneyou love, think about if they died. wouldnt you want people to come contfor you. It would also just be a fun experience getting to see new places if not before.

In conclusion if you wouldnt like to loose family, friends, or animals you rely on or just love come help those who have went through those times. Why dont you show those people that you care and want to help. So now what do you think about joinging UNRRA.   ",2
d72e9b0,"Do you think driverless cars is safer than non-driverless cars? Some people think that driverless cars ae better and others don't,but I know that driverless cars are better. There are a huge amout of reasons why driverless cars are better but I am going to name a few.

One reason driverless cars are better is because the smart cars will have the new technology. Paragraph 4 states, ""Google's modified Toyota Pruis uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel,a rotating sensor on the roof,a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror,four automotive radar sensors,a GPS receiver,and an inertial motion sensor. The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR,it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings.""All of the new technology allows the driverless are to copy the skill of a human at the wheel. The non-driverless cars doesn't really have all of this newer technology.

Another reason driverless cars are safer because within 10 years the sensors will become more complex and advanced. The sensors on the car will be able find and respond to the dangerous situations,such as rollovers or skids. Accoring to paragraph 5,""Within 10 years,those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information for the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine,allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.""More improvements to the sensors and computer hardware not only make driving safer but it could make the car handle more driving task by itself.

Driveless cars do has its fault too. You can't even test out a driverless car or computer driven car in most states,according to the passage. In California,Nevada,Florida. and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars,as stated in paragraph 9. the government still need to make new traffic laws for the driverless cars too. For example,if the driverless car is crashing by itself and someone gets injured who is responsible for the injuries.

In conclusion,driverless cars is the better and safer car because they will have sensors on them and the new technology. With the driverless cars the driver can just relax and let the driverless car do the work. The driverless car will be way more advanced than any other non-driverless car.",4
d586afa,"Did you know venus surface,tempertures average over eight hundred degrees fahrenheit,and the atmospheric pressure is ninety times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

The author supports the idea that studying the planet venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because earth should not be limited by the dangers of exploring and expanding the human eye.

As the curiosity of the human's eye wanting to figure out what new discoverys they can go to and end up in.

The authors explanation of trying to make this challenge a reality and striving to see whats on the other side because human curiosity will likely lead us into many other explorations that are imagination can hold.

In the article of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" they state that atronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system. In paragraph 4 their theory of venus was that it was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life'just like earth. Also showing that today venus has various features that are similar to earth like the rocky sediment,valleys,mountains,and even craters. furthermore explaining that our closest option to visiting another planet similar to earth would most likely be venus.

In the article of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the National Aeronaustics and Space Administration which is NASA is working on approaches of studying venus with electronics made of silicon carbide and have them tested in a chamber simualting the chaos of Venus's surface. In paragraph 7 they talk about how using old technolgy that was being used in World war two would be better to discover venus than using are previous technolgy because the shocking part about old technology was that they make calculations by using gears and levers and would not require any electricity. They also state that even if modern computars are enormously powerful,flexable,and quick they can not with stand the physical conditions of venus. Explaining the authors idea of them wanting to discover and expand their curosity and many more adventures that it can lead too.

The authors idea is explained threw out the article how astronomers and pioneers should continue to explore and continue to strive on thinking what's on the other side. As they show and represent that they are using there old technolgy to try to reach the impossable to make it possable but also using venus as a place if needed to be used as a nearest option for a planetary visit. This is what striving and hunger of human curiosity can lead us too an could lead human's to many more adventures.   ",4

81d1258,"What are the advantages of limiting car use? Eventhough cars are a really fast way to get from one place to another there are many other ways for example a train,air plane or boat. There are too many cars on the streets and many crazy drivers. People should stop using cars because cars make greenhouse gas and it's causing the air to be polited. Another advantage for limiting car use is that less people are going to be geting killed because of car axcidents or because of drunck drivers. Also if people stoped driving cars aand tok there bike to work or were ever they go more people would be in shape becuase they would be doing some excersice too.

Too many cars on the steets are poluting the air and thats not good for us because we are cutting down trees and we are going to run out of air to breath at some point if we continue like this. Thats why poeple should stop driving cars and ride a bike to there job or take the train. Also cars make geenhouse gas, cars are responsible for 12 persent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states. We are also going to have less death because many people die in car axcidents and becuase of drunk drivers and less kids are going to be getting hurt or killed if there on the street because they dont have to worry about cars hitting them. For example if a kid is playing with a ball and the ball goes to the street the kid is probably going to go get it but he wont get hurt because there are no cars on the streets.

Eventhough cars cause greenhouse gas, air polution and death they are also very help full because if you have to go late at night to get food you have a fast way to get to the market because u have a car right out side your door. Also if something happens to your son in school or if u or someone needs medical attention you have a fast way to take them to the hospital or to get to were they are. But theres a down side if you go out to see what happend to you son in a hurry you probably going to have a car axcident and get seriously hurt or worst. Too many people use too many cars the streets are always crouded with cars at all times and some of these people drive crazy or they try to show of there car by going fast and end up getting killed or killing someone els.

This are some of the advantages of limiting car use less people would die,we would have more air to breath, and there would be less green house gas effect. And i think think that it is a good idea to stop using cars and take your bike to work because you would be helping earth and will be getting some exersice at the same time. And you would also be helping to to save earth and have a better future for you kids. Well this is what i think but what do u think?    ",3
e8dcd9e,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" there are examples proving that this is just a landform. In the beginning of the article is starts out with the things that could have been true such as an alien artifact. Throughout the years technology gradually improved, therefore we could see more. Some still don't believe that it could just be a landform, but I am going to try to give you multiple examples so you can see what we saw.

The first part of the article is information about what we found. It mentions how everyone made a big commotion about the Face. Who wouldn't though? We don't see this often, but it is in fact a butte or mesa. Back in 1976 we didn't get the best picture. So we got closer tried to get the best shot possible. After we got closer, also in 1976, we ended up with a success and get a clear photo. Yes, it did look like a face, also depending on which angle you look at it though. Some say it looked like it resembled an Egyptian Pharaoh. It took a lot of research to realize what it was, we had an idea but we weren't so sure in the beginning.

We have people believing that NASA is lying. I can assure you we are not lying. With our budget, we wish there was an ancient civilization. This would be a breakthrough! So for everyone skeptic, and the people thinking we are lying it isn't true. We put so much money and time into researching this. It isn't an easy proccess. It's actually really hard, you have things you have to find out. We also didn't want to give out false information. We had to let people know the truth and that is why we didn't just tell everyone there was a face (landform) on Mars right away.

Eventually it led to the media. The Face was all anyone was talking about. It was everywhere. In the article it talks about how it became a ""pop icon."" It talks about how this ended up starring in a Hollywood film. It appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. It was all people would talk about in the grocery lines as well, or as the article calls it, ""haunted grocery store checkout lines."" This went on for 25 years. This was a very big conspiracy, well that's what some wanted to believe. Since it was everywhere and there were so many rumors about it, this got the people who were big conspiracy theorists all wound up. No matter what information we presented them with, they just didn't want to believe, they were feeding into their own opinions and basing everything off of the untrue rumors. There are many people who still don't believe us to this day.

We are almost 100% sure this is a landform. We have looked very, very closely at these pictures, and it has changed overtime. If you look in the article, at the very beginnning they have three pictures with different years, the first was taking in 1976. The second was in 1998 and the third was in 2001. If you look closely they aren't the same, it's a landform, it changed. We have also looked at things on earth to try to compare. We have landforms in the midwest that look like this as well. Sure some don't look exactly the same as ""the Face"" but that's because they are landforms. Landforms are different. Things erode and change overtime. In the article it says that Garvin had looked at some things as well and he said, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" and ""That's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This is how he sees it, Which is also fact, there is a Plain in Idaho that he thinks is similar. The lava dome may be something that could have occurred with the mesa on Mars too.

In conclusion, I am writing this and including many reasons why the Face was not created by aliens because I am giving the truth. I have given more than enough reasons and so many different facts. I hope you believe me along with NASA. It's just a landform. It changes overtime, it just happened to look like a face. We get that it looked like a face, but when you think about it, it also depends on how you look at it. It was weird to a lot of people. We are sorry for any false information that was brought up. Just know that false information wasn't from us. These are the facts, I hope I have convinced you. ",4

830530f,Venus exploration I can tell the author cares about venus by putting down many ways humans can exploer it from going there he says it was very worthy of going we would just need a blimp like vehicle too hover over 30 miles above the land becuse the surface of venuse is very hot just in the blimp hovering over 30 miles would be 170 dagrees but where the blimp is sitting its at sae levels on earth. They are finding out ways too make electronics go onto venus because there is a lot of danger if we put a human on venus 170 dagrees is too hot for the human body unless they got the blimp at freezing tempatures the people inside will burn righht up blood will boil and people will get heat strokes. But if we put electronicson the planet that can survive the tempatures we might not have a problem with people being burned alive and we could actually exploer the lands of Venus we could make vheacles out of strong silicone for this mission it would be easier too make vehicle out of the stuff.,1
645d251,"In this essay I am going to talk about NASA discussing the Face with, someone who thinks it was created by aliens and I am suppose to convince that is wasn't a alien who, made the Face. Why don't I believe that wasn't a alien because it could have been a rock that landed and it shaped the Mars into a face in 2001.

So why I don't think aliens made it beacuse aliens aren't real, and they would have did something different probably if they were real. In this essay I don't think it was by aliens because it says "" The caption noted a ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nise, and a mouth.

I don't think aliens made this because of the pictures and things. They would have showed up and given us a sign that they were there and there are satellites up that takes pictures of all the things and planets.

For my conclusion I think aliens did not make the Face because of many reasons and because, of the technology today we could have picked up a signal or something because, of the satellites and all of the technology we have today.   ",2

Everyone experences diffrent things every day no matter what they do. People may always be distgusted by going somewhere or even leaving something valuable for something thats not worth a probably a penny. A lot of people are happy for there own reasons might be seeing the sun shine. Or even hearing birds singing we dont need a computuer for these when we know how to read emotions. A computer desgined to read or emotions on calculate emotions, facial expressions, and impressive calculations no bodody needs a computer to read what we our feeling.

When someone asks if your ok from what they are seeing from your eyes face or acting they try to help they dont calculate emotions for someone. In paragraph 2 ""how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"".

Do we type what makes us sad and a robot answers with a question or something silly or something out of subject for the answer. In paragraph 3 ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"".

If it just looks at the human muscles than theres in issue becuase we could be hurt and not be sad, or something else it could just be we hurt something or just lost a tooth we don't need the calculations to tell us how we feel.

Facial expressions is when we are show if we are happy, sad, angry, and surpirisesd. In paragraph 4 "" emotions are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like smiling broadly)."" Everyone can read peoples expressions unless they just look the same everyday of the week. Therapists are trained for this to see how people are to read to see how they feel if they feel bad or good. In paragraph 4 ""By weighting the diffrent units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece)"".

Not everyone is good at looking at facial expressions or how somone is acting out if someone takes the time to help there friends out or even somebody they can see that they can read emotions well enough without a computer.

The conclusion is we dont need machines helping us with our emotions. If we do we gotten lazy or even just they cant read it or they dont want to read the facial expression on there face. Some of us are glad we can help others for not ourselves without the help of tech we dint need tech in every part of our lives. What we need is people that can help or even want to help us out. The computer is looking for what we normally hunt for when making sure someone is ok we dont need it to calculate emotions for us, looking into our facial expressions, and we can perform impressive calculations on our own if we try to       ",2
baed3dd,"Face on Mars? Aliens? What? Some conspiracy theorists believe that a face found on Mars from a photo taken by Viking 1 - a Mars Global surveyor -

was created by aliens who lived on the planet over 300 billion years ago. NASA released information and a picture about the 'Face on Mars,' to the media, with the caption, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head."" The face believed to be found on Mars is nothing less then a rock formation, and was not created by aliens.

Mission controller Garvin says, ""It's not easy to target Cydonia."" He also noted that his crew does not pass over the Face very often. This rock formation is nothing more then a piece of the planet that has been wore down by the clouds on Mars. Research shows evidence that this formation has been on Mars for billions of years. Over time the wind and atmosphere has shaped the rock into the form of what looks to be a Face.

NASA leaked evidence about the Face on Mars when they unveiled the image for the public and media to see, stating clearly that the Face was formed by, ""shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting to see the image on a JPL website, the text in fact quoted, ""It was a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

The people that do believe that there was alien life on Mars, think that the aliens markings were hidden by haze, and believe the Face is ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars. Contarary to what skeptics and other theorists think, there is no actual piece of true evidence discovered by NASA to prove otherwise.

Garvin and his team said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyarmids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" So this actual NASA evidence that the mysterious ""Face"" found on Mars was nothing but a simple landform.

The NASA Space Program has been around for decades. NASA has not yet found evidence to consider the Face on Mars was alien artifacts. Even with NASA's best cameras, there just isn't a theoretical proven fact that this could have become an artifact from ancient aliens. The Face on Mars, is not a face, but simply a landform, that was formed over billions of years ago. ",4
06766be,"In a argument between against or for driverless cars, I am for driverless cars. I think it's a good idea to have driverless cars. It will safer on the streets. There

should be a whole new set of laws regarding to these cars. I also think they shouldn't be released until these cars are truly driverless.

As I said earlier driverless cars shouldn't come out until they are completely do not need a driver. When they are driverless it would resolve conflict between if there were an accident who the blame would be on. The blame would be on the company that made the car because the driver isn't doing anything. I think there should still be a mode in the car where the driver can takeover if the driver sees a situation where he should control the car. I think the car should be smart enough to know how to get through traffic jam, that shouldn't be a problem. The new laws should be that all cars will have to go a certain speed. I don't see how you could get in a car accident if they are all going the same speed. Even though most people would have a driverless car, some people will still have old cars that need a driver. So if there is an accident between a driverless car and a old car that requires a driver, I think the blame should be in the driver in the old car because the driverless car is following all the laws and is going a certain speed so if there was an accident it would be on the driver that isn't following the laws. But then again the driverless car could have technical difficulties and could crash. I think the car should know when it is having technical issues and pull over to the side so the driver can take control. Even though the car is driverless I think the laws for getting your license should not change. Also some people like to drive so the should be and option that is opposite to cruise control we the driver can drive, but when you are driving you have to be ready to take responsibility for anything that happens while you are driving.

In conclusion, driverless cars would be a great idea. It would lead to less accidents as long as the car it programmed the right way. Texting and driving would be as big of an issue as it has been lately with a driverless car. With a driverless car there are less choices being made and less opinions. Our generation would be great to take on the challenge because we take on new things everyday with things being invented everyday. With all that being said I am for driverless cars. It is a great idea and would save lives also. ",3
9625868,"I think that there shouldn't be any driverless cars. There are a couple of reasons why i think that there shouldnt be any driverless cars. One way is that all people need to know what to do when driving, also needs to know all the signs and what they mean. Also i think people need to focus on what is going on infront of them. Yes, it's a smart idea but there also could be somethings wrong with it.

Theres many reasons why it's a bad idea and some good things that come out of it. What if something goes wrong with the car and malfunctions. The car can put a lot the owners at risk. Some good reasons for the driverless car is, some people wnats to drink like coffee and doesnt have enough time and also might want to eat breakfast, but if they are in a hurry to get to work the driverless car is there to drive itself for you to have time to eat. It really is a smart idea. If safety is a big concern they need to think about every possible outcome there is for the safety of the owner.

Here are some reasons why the driverless car could be a good and bad idea. In my opinion i still think it's a bad idea, but some people might think otherwise. Some people might need that type of car to work with their scheldrules. It even says in paragraph 9, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault, the driver or the manufacturer?"" My opinion for that is i think it will be the manufacturer that is at fault, because they want people to buy this car and when people do things could go wrong. All people are different. That's my opinion, so what's yours?                  ",3
35cb607,"The article I read was mainly talking about one of the planets near earth which is Venus and Mars but they were talking about the planet of Venus. Venus is a planet where humans could not live there because we could not support all the stuff they have there.

The author uses entertain to show us suspense about the planet Venus. The author uses suspense to show us how dangerous Venus is and how we could not live there.

The author uses suspense to show us about how there is a place called Venus which has really bad conditions to the point that you can easily die. In the article it shows how the author describe us the tearms in the planet Venus. ""Since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus's in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging for humans to study, despite its proximity to us"" The author uses suspense to show us how dangerous it is to even touch Venus. It also shows us that not even a spacecraft could survive there less than some few hours.

The author also use suspense to entertain us about the planet of Venus and to show us how of bad conditions they have in the planet of Venus. In the text it shows how the author showed us about how bad it is and what are the terms in the the planet of Venus. ""A thick atomosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planets's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" The authour uses suspense to show how the planet of Venus is really had bad terms to live there and how you would die easliy. It also shows that Earth compare to Venus shows how we couldn't support the conditions.

The author uses suspense on both paragraph to show that the planet Venus is really bad condition to live and how not even one spacecraft could land there without surviving. It also shows how the terms in Venus is and how powerful it is compare to Earth percent on carbon dioxide, degrees and atmospheric pressure. This relates to real world stuff by scientists trying to see if they could land there safely without any harm but as you see on the paragraphs it's not possible because you can easliy die because of the terms there. The article shows how the author uses suspense on the article and shows the terms of conditions on planet of Venus.",3
2eb6973,"Everyone assumes that the best way of transportation is by a car. Teenagers dream of getting their license on their sixteenth birthday and maybe even getting a car. Most adults use cars to get to and from work, drive their kids around and do fun activites. But what people don't understand is that there are so many other alternatives that ultimately result in a happier and healthier planet. There are so many downfalls with driving and owning a car that many are now believeing that it is much more reasonable to just not own a car.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Rosenthal, line 6). Having cars stress people out and people don't even realize this. There are so many responsiblities that come with driving. No one enjoys sitting in long traffic jams. It is annoying and quite bothersome. Everyone gets so frustrated, nevermind the amounts of accidents that lead to injury and death from it all.

In Colombia there is a day once a year in which cars can not go on the road or they are served with a fine. This effort is to try to bring stress levels down and stop air pollution. ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the street of this capital city eerily and devoid of traffic jams"" (Selsky, line 23). This idea promoted excersize and got people out and doing things in the community. The citizens clearly were not against this day or else they wouldn't have been acticve. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city"" (Selsky, line 28). This just goes to show what driving does. It isolates people. Without all the cars, one is more willing to spend time outside and interacting with other people and since people were out and about more and enjoying the community, the area has gotten more presentable and pleasureable to be in. ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Selsky, line 29). Officals and shop owners are making more of an effort because everyone is more active and caring.

In Paris, the officals made an effort to try and clean up the cities pollution rates. They assigned a day where even number licensed plates could not be on the road and a day for odd numbered plate cannot be on the road or else they will be fined. ""Congestion was down 60 percent"" (Duffer, 14). If anything, it goes to show that the amount of cars on the road is absurb. 60 percent is more than half, that's a lot of traffic. Paris primarily uses diesel, causeing a lot more pollution in this busy city. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"" (Duffer, line 17). Paris is a very touristy area and people go in hopes to see a beautiful city. This project went so well that officals planned to continue it. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" (Duffer, line 19). If officals planned to continue this idea, than it must be benifical in some way. If citizens just made an effort to not drive everywhere, than restrictions would not have to be mad. It's because of the amount of driving that is going on that officals have to get involved.

""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions..."" (Rosenthal, line 37) Motor vehicals cause so much danger to Earth. The amount of pollution is so high and dengerous. It is much easier to prevent than everyone believes. One could simply take the bus, ride a bike, only drive to work and needed places, walk, and even car pool. There are an abundant amount of ways to prevent so much pollution and stress. It's all over the world that this is an issue; Paris, Colombia, the United States, and many other places. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. "" (Rosenthal, line 11). That is a lot. It isn't difficult to help prevent this.

In the long run, not driving would result in happier people anyways. Cars are so expensive that is would cause less aggravation and economic stress as well as the basic stress of just driving and being in traffic. Society could make the world so much cleaner and safer for the next generations. It starts now. Get a bike or a pair of walking shoes and start getting active in the community. Start making the changes now so it isn't forced by officals later. make the effort and show the next generations how life should be. This could lead to a much happier and healthier life style.    ",4
185b01a,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify humans emotions to see humans' reactions while they are using their computers. Computers can recognize emotions by the way you look, and it is allow to the computers to understand your feelings, and to change the topic because they used this technology to see Mona Lisa's emotions. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model on the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" When technology developed they started their project with a 3-D computer.

A claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions are that the computer can detected the emotions of the student because it has a ""Web ad appears"" on the screen of the student's computer, and it can see his/her different emotions by the way their faces are.

According to the text in paragraph 6 Dr. Huang explains how the computer might work if the student doesn't like what he/she has in the computer and it says ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers can understand that, too."" It means that technology has developed, Dr. Paul Eckman and Dr. Huang created the FACS to see humans emotions, it has six basic as: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The Doctors are showing that the new computers can see what it is in your mind because they improved the technology.

My conclusion is that the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a good appications for a variety of industries because it is able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they try to hide their emotions. The new technology has ""Empathy because it can feels someone else's emotions and can handle the complex algorithms. ",2
d62b9c4,"It's safe to say that almost everyone on Earth has tried to hide their emotions on at least one occasion. Humans do this for a reason, and that reason is that they do not want others to know about them. Trying to pry those emotions out can lead to anger, frustration, and confusion. So a person being surrounded by emotion-detecting computers might not be the greatest thing. Now add the factor of millions of emotional teens being faced with them in a place where they are already strained. One of the worst things one can do is assume about something they can't truly understand. The use of the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to students in a classroom.

The first obvious elephant in the room is that everyone shows emotions in a different way. While Dr. Huang points out that human facial expressions are universal, he does not deny that ""individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (Paragraph 4). This stands to be an issue when it comes to reading a persons face. If everyone has different facial expressions, how effective can a computer be at tracking them? It isn't a valuable resource to use if there are so many unreliable factors that play into the performance.

In this day and age computers have taken over in classrooms. Students ranging from elementary to college use them on a daily basis. By adding FACS, Dr. Huang predicts that "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Paragraph 6). This sounds great, but it just isn't reliable. When using a computer in a classroom, students aren't exposed to just the computer. Their environment can effect the way they feel as well. A student could be having multiple conversations that spark emotions like anger, boredom, or confusion. If FACS picks up on those emotions that don't accurately reflect how the student feels about the lesson content, then it isn't providing valuable information. Without it providing useful information, the technology isn't valuable in a classroom.

One aspect of FACS that is useful is that it would create a system that appeal to individual users. A nice example used in the article is ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (Paragraph 6). This is extremely helpful and great for getting rid of those pesky ads. However, it has nothing to do with students in a classroom. Students aren't exposed to ads, and this would provide no benefit for them. The value of this is nonexistent in a place where it can't be used, such as a classroom.

While FACS may be an extremely impressive software, it just doesn't serve as a benefit for students. There are no truly reliable elements that will improve classrooms in a meaningful way. It may be useful to some, but when it comes to students it is not a valuable piece of technology to have.      ",6
52106bd,"The use of this technology is not valuable for a studdent in a class because some emotions are to be kept because with this technology students emotions will be out there for people to wonder what is happening with the child.Well how about the child do not want other people to know what is happening in his or her life or with his or her emotions.In the artical it states that the computer could recognize when the student is beccoming confused or bored, My question is how will the teacher know when she is teaching the children, and how will she know that one of her students is confused, it also stated that it could modify the lesson like a human instructor and that would be taking jobs from teachers . One of my questions is that if the computer knows what you are feeling and if it says that you are bored and the computer will modify to like a human instructor will it spice things up and make lessons funner and interesting so kids won't get bored?Im againt using this technology for it to read the students emotions because some emotions are to be kept and it is creepy for a computer to be reading your emotions that maybe you didn't know you were feeling.",2

It would be putting your enviorment in danger, as well as yourself.

In conclusion, driverless cars shouldn't be a factor anywhere. Due to minors, systems being corrupted, or the simple fact that it's no one to blame for damages or deaths it could lead.

I also feel that most people wouldn't be able to afford them and then companies are wasting money. Why would a company make something that won't sell very well?

As I said, they could malfunction while someone is driving. A wire could be loose or the sensors could stop at any time. The car may not even be able to tell you that there are issues if there is a problem on the main circuit. What would happen if I hit somebody because my sensors stopped working? In the article it said that they are not sure if the blame is on the driver or the company. To me that's unfair, I wouldn't purposely hit somebody. There are too many flaws to this idea and even more could occur down the road. It's too unsafe and multiple disasters are more than likely to occur.

These cars would also cost a lot of money. In today's economy, a lot of people are struggling to even get jobs. They wouldn't waste money on something they don't need. They have a car that they can drive themselves, that's more safe. People would also have to pay for gas and probably have to get it checked out for multiple reasons. How much would all of it cost?

Overall I feel it could be helpful in some ways but would you really trust a driverless vehicle? You wouldn't just send your kids in a car with no driver. It doesn't seem very safe and I feel that there are too many flaws. I wouldn't continue developing them for cost reasons and safety issues. Once you fix one flaw, you are more than likely to just find another. This is why I feel we should quit developing driverless cars.              ",3

00f6383,"Lately there has been a lot of contreversy with ways to elect and which way is more effective and what is preferred by the majority of people. The problem with that is that many people are very biased when it comes to elections. Many poeple are raised with a certain way that their parents might have thought them was correct and that was how they were taught to elect. Although there is not a wrong way to elect, there are more effective and quicker ways to do it. I personally think that the best way to vote would be through popularity.

Electoral College is a ""compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."". Many people think that Electoral College is rubbish and complicated and I agree. According to paragraph ten in the passage the first sentence says "" Under the electoral college, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" which means that it is more of a process to vote through this system. Instead of you inputing your opinion on who you would like to be President you are basically saying that you believe that this slate of electors have a better idea of who would be a better President.

The electoral college is known to be extremely unfair to voters. In paragraph thirteen the second sentence states ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" which is true because the slate of electors are obviously teams of people who root for the same candidate which gives independent voters close to no chance if they are not voting for the same candidate.

Overall I think that the electoral college way of voting is old and worn out and maybe its time that it went out of business and the popular vote takes its place. With the popularity vote not only do you get to have a chance of choosing the president without the electoral vote canceling out your vote but you also get to go around saying that you're part of the reason why your candidate won. Many people may disagree with me and say that my opinion is not a good opinion but from all of the statements that I have heard, I will still continue to believe that the popularity vote is the best way to vote.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a fun experience in many ways. One way is all the places that you travel to. I have seen many landmarks, such as the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, and I also have been through the Panama Canal on my way to China. Also it is a fun experience after the animals had to be unloaded, we all played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed. Also there would be table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and many more fun activities. Those were all some ways we had a fun experience during the program.

Our program also takes care of animals, but that can also be fun in many ways. One way is that it can keep you busy is when you are caring for the animals during crossing. They have to be fed and watered three times a day. What helped me prepare for hard work was when I would help on my Aunt Katie's farm as a boy. Also I would serve as a night watchmen, which meant I had to check on the animals every night. Once I almost died doing that job one rainy night. As you can see, taking care of animals can be hard but also fun here at Seagoing Cowboys program.

My favorite part was traveling to many countries and all the beautiful sights. I have gotten to see Europe and China during our journies. Cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. I have also toured an excavated castle in Crete, and have been on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, the city with streets of water.

Politics aren't a popularity contest, they are an important asset of this great nation and should not be taken lightly.  The Electoral College is one of the many compromises established by The Founding Fathers of these United States and if they believed in the compromise why go and change it? With this method citizens can be certain that there will be a new president next term without fault.

To ferther elaberate, people might argue that this ""winner takes all method"" is outdate and irrational, but do people really know what this method is? The Electoral College is a process that consist of a body of electors, 538 to be exact, the majority of the votes is required to elect the President. Your state also has a say in this , it has an allotment of electors that equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation. In lamens terms theres a vote for each member of the House of Representives and two for your Senators. This process is simple.

There is always the chance of a dispute- it happened in 2000- but with this method its less likely. As stated in sourse 3 by Richard A. Posner he sets the 2012 election as an example by saying ""Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes.""  That's 10.4 percent more than popular voting methods. Posner also adds "" A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes--538-- is an even number, but it is highly unlikely..."" With the Electoral College there is certainty of outcome.

The evidense is there, certainty of outcoome gives the public a sigh of relief and with such a simple process of election there will be no confusion. So like mentioned before if it ain't broke don't fix it this process has been around for more than a century and it hasn't failed yet.                                                   ",3
ea97531,"Technology is advancing at a rapid rate and is consuming our lives. With the new software created by Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe, computers are now able to recognize human emotion. This technology can be useful for various things. The software can make video games more realistic, it can give more insight on psychology, and it can even be useful in classrooms.

Often, children in classrooms do not understand certain things, but may be too shy to ask questions. With the emotion recognition, teachers will be able to tell who is understanding the topic and who is struggling. Another way the software can be helpful to classrooms is that if it shows a child is upset about something, but tries not to show it, that may be a clue that they're struggling with something outside of class. When a child is in a bad state, they will most-likely not try in their classes, but if a teacher could talk to them and help them, it could be a good way to get the child to vent and relieve the pressure from themselves, causing their grades to go up. Lastly, the software can help teachers notice bullying. Many times kids get let off the hook for bullying someone because, ""they were just kidding around"", ""we're buddies"", but that is not really the truth. If the emotional recongition software is installed in schools, teachers will be able to notice if a kid out of a group of people is feeling uncomfortable while the other kids are laughing. Stopping each of these problems will allow the children to make better grades, be less stressed, and hopefully enjoy school.

Technology is a big piece of this generation and it has come a long way and has helped society a lot. The advancements in them are drastic and they continue to become more useful to society. The emotional recognition software can help make many impacts on this world to make it become a nicer place. Using the software in classrooms would be an awesome start.",3
58a4fb5,"There's a bunch of controversy over the driverless cars. Some people hink that they are a good idea and some people don't. Many people have their opinions on this topic. Now it's time for me to tell you mine.

In my opinion I think that driverless cars would be a good idea. Driverless cars would help out a lot. Like in the first paragraph in the passage it said that the cars would use half the fuel that taxis use, and it would offer more flexibility then a bus. Just imagine having a car like that. Yeah the car would have its flaws, but that would be an amazing thing to have. Also imagine having a car with no driver. Yeah it sounds scary, but it would be cool. The only major bad thing about having one would be having to worry about serious accidents that might happen.

That's why I think that driverless cars would be cool to have. There are good and bad things about having driverless cars, but I mean there's good and bad things about everything, You have to have an open mind to new things. Driverless cars could help out with so many things. Don't just focus on the negative things. You have to look at the poditive side of this.   ",2

this technology could be one of the most benifical things for students. A great example of how it can help is people with depression. If the technology is acurate with its calculations we can help the people that are suffering from depression and are sucidal. The only promblem is how hard is it to hid your emotions from the system. if it is easy to hide from it then it will not help at all. the best way to get the 3-D constructs of ther face would be ethier a test when they sit in front of a computer or blend it in with picture day. in the future every school sould have these so they can figure out what is going on with a student emotions to help them.

that was my stance on if we should be for or agaist the technolgy to read students' emotional expressions. I suppoet this because of the promise the system shows.

I hope that some people dont run it into the ground.",2
4a7f13c,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) enables computers to identify human emotions. This may or may not help students feel better or help them at all in school. But i think it could be helpful although it could be a little distracting.

I think the FACS could be helpful in a clasroom. Not only because it could help them with their emotions but because it could help better education. Students can teachers can use the coding system to know what the student think about the lesson they are teaching. Wether it is fun or not, teachers can figure out what they are doing wrong. This could help better education because teachers can use it to make the lesson more entertaing so students would actually pay attention. The text mentions that, ""a classroom coputer could recognize when a student is becomig confused or bored."" This means that using the coding system students may be more interested in learing. This also means that when knowing when the students are confused, and sicne some students may be afraid to ask for help, teachers now know when to jump in and help a student.

The coding system may also help in the fact that it could make students and/or teachers happy. The author gives the reader an experiment to try, which is similar to what the coding system does. After the experiment he then asked, ""by the way, did making a happy face in this experiment also make you feel slightly happy?"" He then provided information about how just using the coding system could make you happy. This could help students be happy while in school, have them better focused. I think that being happy can change the way on how you view things. When you are happy and someone asks you a question you'll probly answer nicley. But when you are sad or angry the chances of you answering the same way are very low. The FACS could help with that by changing the way you feel. ""Moving your facial muscels not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" This is why I think, it making you happy students can be more involved in the classroom and in learning. Having the teachers happy could also mean they can teach better and in a nice way, helping more and more students. I can now conclude that with the FACS making students happy, it can help them in the classroom.

In conclusion, I think the FACS could help studetns in their classroom, having them happy and ready to learn. Because having the students and techers happy they can learn more and they can learn better.              ",3
6eecf35,"Driverless cars is an easy excuse to get yourself into a car accident. I truely dont think the world would be ready for a technological advancement like this.

I am against driverless cars. As the aricle states, the cars aren't truely driveless. When the author stated this, it made me still think that this idea could still be dangerous. I feel like there will be more accidents with driverless cars than with regular cars of today. My feeling is how will a self-driving vehicle sense that there is a crash? How will it know if there is a car stopping in front of them? It just seems like an easy way to get into an accident. I think it would be better for the world to have an assisting car, not a self driving car.

In saying this, the world is not ready for a self-driving car in the near future. I think that in the hands of somebody smart and responsible, this idea would be great. But i think the world has to many irresponsible people in it to have a privelage like this.        ",2
28d2498,"The limiting of persoanlcar usage has done wonders for the areas that this policy has be implmented. Strictly enviermentaly swpeaking in the cites that have limited their residents persoal car usage the smog rates went drasicly down. Thoughschanges happened in a matter of days. Imagin the changes that could accoure if limited car usage was implmented on a wider scale for the long term. Not only envirermentaly benifical but limited car usage also has large and far reaching econmic and social upsides. The lack of money being waisted on persoanl automobeal transportation leads to a surplus of savings for everyday familes to spend or more nessary items. Socialy limited car usage has be proven to be benifal as a whole also. People living in areas that have  already been placed under this polices report signifigent reducions in stress and worrying, leading to much weight off their sholders and a genaeral better aqttude over all.

The first and most obveous advantage of the limed car usage policiy is the masive positive impact the police has the earth. As stated in source one and I quote ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."". Now imagin if thoes percentages just went away. In the city of Vauban Germany, an expermental city already under the policy, it did. Another example if Paris. A city that literly had to force the policy of limited car usage apon it people in a desperate attempt to reverse what the evils of personal car usgae was doing to the atmosphere of the city. The personal cars created smog so think the city hit record polution levels that even rivaled Beijing its self, one of the worlds most poluted citys. As stated in source two, the city put a ban on cars with any license plates that were even numbered on the first day from driving and a ban on odd numbered the second day. The positives of the limited car usage plicy was so instantanous that the second day of no driving for odd numbered cars ws deamed not nessary. The massive envirmental advantages of the limited car usage policiy can neiter be denyed or ignored.

The economic advantages of this policy can also not be ignored. To fully grasp the economic upswing that will accure under this policy we must turn our attention the the great city of Bogota, Colombia. In this former Spanish colony turned capital city a program has been set up called the ""car-free day"". On this day no cars are driven and a festable is set up to promote alternate transportaion and reduce smog. This year two other Colombian citys, Cali and Valledupar joned the event citing the obouse advantages of the policy. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" says buisinessman Carlos Arturo Plaza source 3 quotes. The policy as done economic wonders not only for the people but for the city its self. since the day begin in the mid 1990s over 118 miles of bike path have been created, parksand sports centers have bloomed throughout the city, uneven sidke walks have been leveled out, and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up as reported by source 3. The limited car usage policy cound be the merical policy for citys in need of an economic boost.

Finaly the social advantages of the policy have also been noted.

The evils of the modern day car culture must be destroyed. As said by Carlos Plaza preveously ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"". ""When i had a car I was always tense. Im mush happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter resident of Vauban. Two people on two totaly differnt sides of the world both experenced the social advantages of this policy. Even young people are seeing the advantages according to a study last year that found that driving by young people devreased  23 percent between 2001 and 2009 according to source 4.

As one can now clearly see the advantages of limted personal car usage are impossibkle to deny and even harder to ignore. Economicly,socialy, and enviromentaly this policy as done wonders where ever it has been implimented. It has both immeadit and long term positive effects with no odveous negitive effects. Altrnates to personal cars could be things like Bill fords bisiness plan for a world in which personal vehical ownership is replaced witha partnering with the telecommunications industy to create citys in which pedestrians, bicycle, private cars, and public and commerical traffic are woven into a connected netword. The acceptence of limited car usage and the extenciton of modern day car culture is the next step for the advacment of humanity.            ",4
7837555,"The Great Opportunities of Seagoing Cowboys

""He knew it was the opportunity of a lifetime"". The Seagoing Cowboys program lets us help countries in need of food, animals, and much more. People should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because of the traveling, the experince, and the opportunity to help others in need.

First of all, Seagoing Cowboys get to travel around the maginficent world. Some might say that it is not worth it because they might get hurt, however,they travel overseas, letting them see the marvels of the oceans.We can also tour an excavated castle in Crete and see all wonderful places at the Panama Canal on their way to pleading countries. In my opinion, joining has its benifets. You can awe at many beautiful places, and might be inspired.

Secondly, the experience would be wonderful. Some will argue and say that you might not even have an experinece at all, but in my belief, anybody can have an experinece during your time at the program. We sail all over the gigantic world and help hundreds of pleading people. You can take a gondola ride in Veinice, Italy, and see the Acropolis in Greece, which was very special. I believe that the experience gives us a lifetime of memories after our journies.

Finally, being a Seagoing Cowboy gives us the opportunity to help people in need. Some might say that you can get badly injured while trying to help others, but it is vital to say that it is more important helping people in need. It is the oppertunity of a lifeime. The cattle boat trips were unbeliveable opportunities for a small town boy.We get to help contries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. Join the Seagoing Cowboys because we get to save hundreds of people, which leaves a good feeling in us for helping others.

In conclusion, others should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because of the traveling, the experince, and the opportunity to save others in need. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than an adventure, it opened the world to us. If you want to help others, please consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys program.   ",4
2150433,"Cars have long been viewed as a common method of transportation from point A to point B. However, in the world that we live in cars have become a burden and limited use would be best. Efforts to reduce car usage have shown to reduce the rate of carbon dioxide produced and smog. The elimination of car use would lead way to further development for other methods of transportation. Countries have taken the first step in banning car usage and its citizens have admitted to living nice and happier lives than they had before.

Common issues faced by car use is the production of carbon dioxide and the risk of smog. Smog is a health hazard to those with asthma, young children, and the elderly. By limiting the use of a car, carbon dioxide and smog rates would plummet dramatically. When Paris was faced with smog at near-record levels driving was banned and after a day of the driving ban smog levels were dropping already. Cars, a major contributor to carbon dioxide production, can decrease the rate of the greenhouse effect by limiting their use. Nearly 50 percent of the United State's greenhouse emissions come from the use of cars alone. By not driving your car the rate of greenhouse emissions would drastically decrease.

Besides the nice look to a car, cars are often used because there appears to be no other way to travel long distances. Other methods of transportation such as riding a bicycle, public transportation, and even walking are viable and beneficial methods of transportation. On bike you travel further than you would walking at a faster rate, Bogota has begun the develpment of 118 miles of bicycle paths in hopes of reducing traffic and carbon dioxide emmisions. A near 80 percent of appropraitions are used on highways, the rest of the 20 percent are used on other methods of transportation. By finding other methods of transportation (ie. walking, biking, public transportation) the 80 percent used on highways could be used to greatly improve other methods of transportation, like public transport.

The thought of parting from our cars is a terrifying idea, however countries around the world have taken the initiative and made these ideas law, laws that are benefiting their copuntries. In Germany an ecperimental community, Vauban, has little to no car activity. 70 percent of its families do not own a car and 57 percent sold their car to move to the community. Startingly, not only is this small community a success but many residents claim to be happier than they were when they owned a car. Columbia, like Germany banned the use of cars for one day in Bogota. Not only is everyone enthusiatic of the event but this day has led to the reduction of smog in Bogota.

The question to drive a car is a simple one. Why drive a car when you can walk, ride a bicycle, or can take the bus? By limiting our car use we'll reduce the rate of carbon dioxide emissions and smog. Other countries have tested and proven that life without a car is not only realistic but very beneficial to how one feels. With the options of other forms of transportation we should limit our use of the car. In doing so we'd be improving our lives and the rate of the greenhouse effect.            ",5
03ee9ea,"In this article it talked a lot about how maybe schools could use computers to sensor a student's emotion of either getting bored or losing interest and to be able for the computer to change the lesson slightly to get the students attention, But do you think this would really work? In some cases yes it might work for some people, but definetly not everyone. Why? Because some students may have diformaties in their muscles in their face, facial piercings that could afftect they way the computer reads your emotion, or even just simply you face might be showing one expression but you may feel another way.

Not everyone in the world is same so it's really hard to make something like this that would benefit everyone. You also have to think about the cost of these computers, just think normal computers are already expensive, but ones that can read your emotion you can imagaine that those prices would be unbelievable.

As well as every student learns differently, so if the computer changes the way the lesson is being taught based off of your emotion when maybe the lesson is already clear to you, could make it harder on some students. So overall I believe that this product wouldn't be very successful due to a lot of the roadblocks in the way, especially with money involvment. ",2
edc0b96,"A new technology called the Facial Action Coding Sytem enables computers to identify human emotions. This use of technolgy could benifit students in a classroom. In a classroom, the Facial Action Coding System could also help the teacher in many ways.

Dr. Paul Eckman has been able to detect six different emotions, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. First a computer will do a 3-D computer model of the persons face, making sure all fourty-four major muscles move like human muscles. Next, a psychologist will look over the face and determine all the emotions. Basically it can be determine how someone is feeling just by their face, even if they are trying to hide emotions.

One way this could benifit in the class room is with the lesson plan. As said in the article, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Some students get embaressed if they do not understand the material, so they will not raise their hand for help. With this technology the teacher would know they are confused and be able help them later on one on one. Also, if a teacher sees that a student is starting to get bored, they could start calling on them more to wake them up, and to keep them focused. If the teacher sees everyone is getting bored, they may change up the learning method they are using to teach them.

Another benifit to the Facial Action Coding System is really knowing how someone feels. Some students have a complicated home life and may need to talk about it, but do not know how. For example, say a student comes in class and acts as if they are fine infront of everyone, but once class starts they always appear to be sad. The teacher may realize this and try to talk to them and figure out what is making them feel this way. By doing this they could make that student day, and even make them feel better about themselves.

On the other hand, I could see why some would say they are against using this kind of technology to read student emtional expressions. For example, what if something goes wrong with the computer and they read the expressions wrong. For that reason some people may not trust what a computer says. Also, some student parents may not want their student to be apart of this technolgy.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System could benifit in many positive ways to students in a classroom. This new technology could very much help out in classrooms. Every classroom should try it!",4
cb53110,"The Unmasking Face on Mars is just a natural landform on Mars. Many objects on Earth can resemble a face it could just be a mountain of sand that some how looks like a face. In the article it claims of huge rock formation that ""resembles"" a face. The picture was taken by a space craft at a far away distance forming shadowing giving the ""illusion"" of a nose, eyes, and mouth.

First, the reason why the ""face"" is a natural landform is because on Earth you can compare a face in many objects around you. Some natural landforms on Earth such as Middle Butte in the Snake river Plain of Idaho looks like it has a face also. You can make out a face in even day to day objects. Even a tree near your neighborhood could look like a ""face"".

Secondly, the reason why the ""face"" is just a natural landform is because the huge rock formation causes shadows. The shadows of the huge formation of rock can create the illusion of a face. The shadows can make it look like it has a nose, eyes, and mouth like structure in cases such as this one.

Lastly, the ""face"" on Mars is a natural landform because the photo was taken by a satelite. The pictures come in pixels meaning it could come out blury or unclear to clarify. The shadowing of the mound also gives the illusion in the picture of a ""face"". The ""face"" on Mars is only a natural landform that was mistaken as something else more than that because of the illusion of a face.      ",3

There is a whole other planet that we lack knowledge of due not pursuing the idea of it. Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers it presents because, it's the Earth's ""twin"", there could be potential life in Venus, and it could improve soceity's point of view on innovation.

The Earth's ""twin""

Venus is considered to be the Earth's twin because of the characteristics they share. Both planets are similar in size, density, and distance from the sun. They're very similar in some ways except for that fact that we live on Earth and not on Venus. If there are so many similarities why don't we live on Venus? Venus is the closes planet to Earth for it's traits. ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason since no spacecraft survivied the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue expalins why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"" states in the article. That sentence from the text shows that we haven't visited Venus, and certainly not recently, which means we don't know if we could for sure not use Venus as a ""second Earth"".

Potential life on Venus

There could be potential life form in Venus. I know this because in the text it states""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" that sentence shows that potential living forms could be or have existed in Venus due to it's oceans. Looking into the idea of Venus potentially having some type of life form is one step closer to making it the Earth's ""twin"".

Improving our innovation due to Venus

We could use Venus for our advantages and disect its intergrety. There could be potential life forms on Venus and it's much more than just a planet. ""Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"" that sentence shows that Venus is a planet that would allow scientists to think outside the box, in a more innovative way of thinking. The text also states ""Not esay conditions, but survivable for humans"" this sentence shows that there would be some challenges along the way but it would be a whole different way of thinking that could lead to a new innovative world.

In conclusion

Venus is a planet worthy to pursuit despite the dangers it presents. I say this because Venus is considered Earth's twin, due to the size and locations. There could be potential life on Venus, maybe we could potentially end up living there. Venus would help us, soceity, scientists, etc, to think in whole different way than we're used to. To innovate ideas, to maybe compare things on how they would on Earth verus in Venus.

1cd7165,"I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Most people think that all you do is work, like taking care of animals. However, there are ways for you to have fun while working. You can play games, read a book, or even see cool sights. Here are a couple of things you could do.

First of all, you can see many different sights and explore while traveling. I know that I have visited some really cool places, like seeing an excavated castle in Crete. You can also see many different things. You could see the beautiful, wavy water or see a beautiful sunset while you travel. Another place I think you should visit is the Panama Canal. So, if you ever get bored and don't anything else to do, you should some beautiful sights and marvelous places. You may never know what you see and even make new friends along the way.

Second of all, you could play games if you get bored. The Seagoing Cowboys program isn't just all about working for animals. It's about having fun and playing games. For example, I know when I joined the Seagoing Cowboys, we would play games, like table tennis, baseball, and even volleyball. You could also read too, if you would like. Where would you play these games, you ask? Back then, we would play in the empty holes where the animals have been housed.

Third of all, you could just have fun. You could read a book, play games, or even relax. Talk to the animals while you take care of them. If all you do is work and no fun, then you are going to not like being part of the Seagoing Cowboys. I remember when I did do a lot of fun stuff, but I had to do work first. I would like to tell you a very good story. One rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I fell down the steps, but luckily I made it okay. I just couldn't work a couple of days because

I had cracked ribs. Trust me on this point. If you say to people that you had a great time, they would probably want to join too.

In conclusion, I made very good and understanding points. First, go visit some sights and places while you explore. Not only could you explore new worlds, but you could also meet new people and try out different languages. Second of all, you could play games. If you play games like volleyball and baseball, you will be more happier when you play games that if you just do work all the time and not have any fun. You will get bored and most likely not enjoy yourself all that much. Third of all, have fun. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program for these reasons. Hope to see you there!",4

I think tectnology has become to big of a part in life.

We should not have to rely on tectnology for eveything.

People are becomeing to depend on tectnology whats going to happen if one day it falls?

If we have driverless cars and something happen? No matter how safe they seem are you really willing to put your life in the hands of tectnology, they might say it is perfectly save but what happens when the car melfuntions and you get into a crash?

If we keep so hevaly relying on tectnology for everthing we do we will never learn.

In the future if all these cars are driving themself and it goes out one day kids that grow up without learning how to drive because they relyed so heavly on tectnolony can not get anywhere.

I think people should stop being so lazy and forget about tectnolony for a while and start to do things on there own.

Kids that are growning up in a air like today will never learn how to surive without tectnolonly and for the most part that is really sad.

I think tectnology in grenaly is becoming more and more over powering in the world today.

Some may see that as a wonderful thing we are smart and can experiance things, but when can we lurn to start doing stuff by hand and taking control of our own lives.

If something were to hand to the driverless cars what would people do?

Are people just to sit in their houses because they can not drive themself anywhere because they forgot or may do not even know how?

I think we should not make these car or not give them to anyone.

We need to have people learing how to drive.

I remember when I was younger I could not wait to drive a car by myself, is tectnolony going to take away some of the biggest moments in a teens life?

If everything were to fall one day we need to be able to be independ and be able to live on our own and take car of our self.

We do not need cars that can drive themself we need people behind the wheel.

Some people say that it was dangerous but I say he did a heroic act by bring cattle and horses to war torn countries. Now we think why he did that for so long, it wasent money, fame, or even for himself. No he did that selfless act for those people who had nothing left after war war 2. If you ask thats why he did it to help those women, men, and children, of china germany italy and all sorts of places that were left in ruins.

In this paragraph will be talking about Luke's claims. Such as he knew it was an opprotunity of a life time. That is supported by parts of the story were he may have to work but has fun in between his hard work. Like when in italy he visits such places like Crete or the Acropolis. There were also bad times like when he fell of that slipery ladder and broke some of his ribs in a storm and almost fell over board if it wasent for a small metal bar holding him in.

For a second lets talk about the time he spent overseas. We look at the fun he had in his nine adventures. Such as when he first visted Greece. He went to the Acropolis, soon after he visited the Panama Canal. Those were just some of the places that he got to travel not includeing Venice or Crete or even China.

The UNRRA created the Seagoing Cowboys program to help recover the damages of World War II, which you can be one of the people to help!

If you think we barely go places, then you're wrong. I have sailed and ocean 18 times while being a Seagoing Cowboy! You might think it takes a massive time out of your life, but it really doesn't. To cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States took me only two weeks! Also, it only took a month to get to China! If you think it is boring, you are wrong once again. When we are sailing across the ocean, we play multiple games, such as baseball and volleyball!

This is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. I got to help others that have been effected by World War II. I also got to sail around and see other countries you have wanted to see. I got to sail around the world playing volleyball and baseball while I waited! I only had one or two duties to do, besides that it is all fun! Before I had a boring life, but when I joined it was full of adventures!",2

4ede8a4,"The author is evaluating how to explore Venus because it is the most familiar planet to Earth. But he is up in the air about trying to do some reasearch on the planet Venus because they have sent aircrafts to the planet before but none of them have been able to topuch down on Venus.

First, scientist have thought the planet Venus was covered in large oceans at one point in time and could support various life forms on the planet. in the text it says, ""Venus has a big gas ring around the atmosphere."" This is showing that it makes it harder for NASA to land on Venus because of the gas that surrounds the planet.

Next, NASA has thought about sending an aircraft to Venus but they have ran into some problems on the way. One of the problems they have ran into is that they cant get close enough to the planet to get any samples or even see whats on the ground. In the text it says, ""At thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to the sea level on Earth."" This is showing that none of the equimpment that NASA has is strong enough to get close to Venus.

In conclusion, NASA has not been able to find a way to get close enough to Venus to do any work or get any samples of the planet. But they are working on making a metal strong enought to last a long period of time left on the planet.",3
b390f90,"''The electoral college is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.'' The Electoral College is one of the most fair systems our society has set up. This process is fair and essential because it is is not the only determination, each state gets the correct amount of power, and it shows a clear winner.

The Electoral College does is not fully responsible for the outcome of the decision for our President. In the year 2000, this was proved, Gore had received more popular votes than Bush, yet fewer electoral votes. ''It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.'' The section of the nation that believes the Electoral College is unfair believes this because they assume all the power is in this system's hands. Yet they are mistaken because clearly our popular vote can override this system if necessary. Though it is very rare most will argue, the fact that it is possible to not allow the Electoral College to take control of our government proves that the power is really all in the hands of the citizens. Clearly, the ''unfair'' picture most perceive is largely mistaken.

The sizes of states in our country widely varies. From Rhode Island to Texas, we have power in Congress. It would simply not be fair if our small states had the same amout of power as our larger states. California has more of a population, therefore should have more say in Congress, than New Jersey. ''Your states entitles allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation; one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.'' Just the way this is set up in Congress, the same amount of power for each state is applied for choosing our President for the next four years. This is only fair to the population of America and equal representation in all the sections of congress would be unfair to the larger states that obviously require and deserve more power than the smaller states in the United States. Basically, power is fairly given to each state under the Electoral College.

''The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.'' Though this situation is rare, in 1968 when Nixon ran against Clinton, both had a total of 43 percent of the popular votes. Yet, because of the Electoral College, a clear winner was shown. If ever in case of this event, this ''pressure'' can complicate and make the choosing of the President way more difficult than it was planned to be. For this reason, our Electoral College sets up a way to take care of this if it was to happen again. Obviously, the Electoral College shows a clear winner and takes out any confusion or problems that could arise.

To conclude, our country is based off of fair rules and systems, one of them being the Electoral College. It is fair because it does not have full power, the right amount of power is applied to each state, and it produces a clear winner. ''Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an electio.''                    ",5
d4d26a5,"My agrument for this passage is that although theses cars seem to be really nice and might help save people from accidients and save money they may not be the best option. Driving is a very serious thing and in this agrument I'm going to tell why i think that they shouldn't be made. Driving can always need improvement why not keep the cars we have and help them out and keep people driving what they own. Plus money is a very important aspect in this agrument, having a driveless car can cost lots of money.

People who drive can say that they don't like driving all the time but most can say that they enjoy getting to drive if we have cars that are driveless that takes away the fun that people have. If we make these driveless cars that means that the newer generations with not know how to drive cars. People will not want ot get put as much if we have driveless cars. I don't think that people have the money to spend on these cars to drive them so we may have lots of people walking if we were to switch to these cars.

If driveless cars are made they is a very big possibility that people will not want to pay attention to the roads and that will cause more accidents than what there already is. Even though the drive is suppose to watch the road when in the car still doesn't mean that people wont think that the car can do it all on its own. They will not watch the road as much as what they do now and it can cause wrecks that are not needed.

Having drivers have a driveless car is not a good idea because they willl think it is okay to play on their phones and mess around in the car. The car may have antilock brakes but that does not mean that the car is completely save for being accident free. If we have teenagers that are driving in these cars they might think that it is expectable to play around even more than what they do now. Maybe adding things to cra sthat we have now and giving them some newer safety assets might be the solution to our problem. That might be a soultion to our probelm of accidents and it will still allow people to drive.

Another thing to think about is the laws that will have to change for these people to make these cars. Like speed limits and how the car will cars handle traffic in large cities. We alos have to think about if they are really a energy saver car or if it is just as bad as the cars we are using.

In conclusion, I think that this car shouldn't be developed for the reasons of safety. This car may have some very nice aditions to it but we still have to think about whats best for the drivers. The cars that we drive now can use some new technogly but having a driverless care kind of seems a little to extreme. People love driving so why not keep the cars we have today and just keep inproving to make them better for us.

But i feel like before anyone makes thier minds up about whether we should or shouldn't uses these cars that are driverless there needs to be more research done and tests to see how these cars work. ",3
7430da6,"The author of this passage provides many reasons on why we should explore Venus. The author states many interesting facts about Venus and ways we could adventure the risky terrain.

According to the author in passage two, Venus is the closest planet to Earths size and density. This meaning, if we were to explore this terrain it could be a possible place to start another biome like Earth. In passage four, the author mentions that Venus has mountains, valleys, and craters that resemble those we have on Earth. The author makes a good point in mentioning that Earth and Venus are very different but also very similar.

The author also reveals to us that Venus has an atmosphere made up of about 97% carbon dioxide. This piece of evidence is backed up with passage five, where the author also states that NASA is thinking about usinng the solution of allowing scientists to float above the harsh conditions of Venus' surface. This would allow our scientists to be able to explore and gather more information about Venus all while avoiding dangerous conditions.

The author does an excellent job at continuing to provide statements that support the idea of exploring Venus. At the end of passage five, the author states that solar power would be plentiful, and the radiation on Venus' surface and atmosphere would not exceed Earths levels of radiation. According to what the author states in passage six, many researchers are working on building machines that can withstand Venus' difficult conditions. This would allow the machines to collect samples from Venus' surface for the machines to bring back to earth for our scientists to analize.

At the end of the article, the author provides the idea that us humans exploring Venus could lead to many other great explorations. Overall throughout the article the author continuously provides valuable reasons on why it is worth it for our scientists to explore Venus. The exploration could lead to many great things accoriding to the information the author provided to us.   ",4
337638a,"I would like our election to be cast on popular vote. It would make more sense for us to be able to elect our president by what everyone thinks and not the electoral college because many things can go wrong. The votes in electoral college don't make sense big states have more votes then the little ones so the candidates focus on big states and the other ones are left out because they have two or three votes. Thats why I think we need a different system or just cast it on popular vote.

Just like the 2000's election Bush won that by getting the bigger states when Gore should've won it because he had more popular votes. The electoral college makes no sense and should be taken down. Many people disagree with the electoral college and know its a big scam for the presidents to win by losing. Thats why it should be casted on popular so its fair for people and not on the size of your state.

The electoral college is an outdated, unfair system on voting. It shouldn't be about the state but what all of the country thinks. Popular vote is the best way to caculate who should be president and who not to be. Our nation would be better off with a new system because the electoral college is getting outdated and isn't a good way to vote for who leads our country. We need a new system because in several places they never seen a candidate or ad to vote in 2000 campaign. Those states didn't see anything because of their electoral votes are small compared to those of the bigger states.

Also you can tie the votes in electoral votes and then we'd have to worry about the vote our House of Representatives would give us. That could be a disaster for us to worry about. Just like Nixon and Clinton had 43 percent of popular vote but winning in the electoral college. Its not fair for most people and it doesn't make sense how he can win but still be losing at the same time. I wouldn't vote until this system is changed because it is completly unfair.

The electoral college is an unfair system that no one wants anymore. We can change our ways of voting so it'll be more fair and it matters on our country's thoughts not our states. Popular vote seems more reasonable and a better way for us to find a good leader. Thats why i think it should be casted on popular vote instead of the electoral college and the United States of America would be better off with what our whole country thinks instead of our size because we represent freedom and need to prove it.

For this argument, I come up with three reasons for that. My first reason is, how can the unmasking face can be natural landform?The answer is, it was created by

an aliens.""How do you know?"" Even other scientist said

that the unmasking face was natural landform I still think it's from the an alien. My secod reason is, the unmasking face look like a human face so the point is the aliens might look like human,us. We don't know if it is a natural landform or not. So, it can be but the only reason for that is, it was created by aliens. My last reson about the unmasking face is, natural landform can be but there's no provement for that .

the ""Unmasking the Fcae on Mars"" is created by an aliens. Why? because that's the only way there's an unmasking face. I'm positive that the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" was created by an aliens.",1

ba7ac6c,"There area couple of advantages to limiting car usage. The most common one would be less pollution. In larger cities pollution is a big deal with all the factories around, but some of that pollution can be redused if less car were used for transportation. To help reduse pollution, as stated in source 1 ""[S]tores are placed a walk away, on main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.""

One way to enforce limiting car usage is to do like it say in source 2 ""after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" People were did not agree with the concept of not driving for the day in the begining and decided that instead of go along with not driving they would rather pay the fine, ""almost 4,000 drivers were fined..., says source 2. The only car that was allowed to drive from Friday to Monday was plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. source 2 says ""the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.""

Another advantage to limiting car usage is that there are less traffic jams. ""[M]illions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took the buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams,"" says sorcure 3. Not driving to work and using alternate transportation is ""...a good opportunity to take away stree and lower air pollution,"" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

In source 4 President Obama said ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" most people seem to be understand and realizing the advantanges of limiting car usuage. in some cases you may think car are very important to our lives, which they are but in other cases they are not. Just sit down and think of what life would be like without cars and you will see it would be better.    ",3
b9558cb,"The author supports further Venus expiditions because of the insight we would gain from it. However, the author seems to forget that these kind of enviromental hurdels take time and money to jump over. A mechanical computer would have slow the process of gathering intel from Venus's surface. Even though silicon carbide electronics sound more appeasing because they last longer, it costs money to buy the materials and build these devices. Rocket fuel is also a bit pricey as it has to have enough fuel to launch and leave orbit and direct itself to Venus. The engineers and scientists have to be paid as well. The author doesn't have an explaination as to where all the money would come from. Venus will chew through the devices and even people we send there.

The idea of sending humans to Venus sounds dangerous, especially since Venus is a hostile enviroment. Venus has a ground temperature of more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit, as mentioned, that temperature will melt tin. If tin can't survive in that heat, so can't humans. The author brings up the idea of having the scientist float thirty miles or more above the surface. This idea seems legitiment except for one thing. Earlier in the article, the author mentioned that the clouds are made out of highly corrosive sulferic acid. The author does not mention how to overcome that obstacle. How are we supposed to explore Venus further if we can't get the money and we can't find a safe way for humans to explore it?

The author does not have many ways as to how to accomplish exploring Venus. Only radical concepts that would only work in a perfect world. They propose these ideas yet they won't elaborate further on them. Maybe this article was meant to inspire some one else to find out a way to explore Venus. However, The author has many ideas, they just need to exlain them. The idea of float in a zeppline above the surface, how do we do that?

3fcf11a,"At first the Electoral College is a process of compromising between election of the president by a vote in congress and by popular votes from citizens. To my opinion I could favor this as a smart compromise.

Second it goes to show that when a president gets elected and wins by popular vote by only citizens is not a good idea. Reason is that people only vote for a certain president based on not their support or ideas for america, but based on their looks. When the Electoral College comes into play, Citizens vote for a slate to pledge a candidate. Then it depends on the state.

Finally when the electors who elected the president and not the people, the citizens votes goes into a good cause. When they agree to a final vote then that candidate gets the job.

In conclusion, I think the Electoral College is a good idea becuase when an idea strikes from a candidate ,and approved by congress. Then everybody wins the vote.         ",2
ed91a38,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes a new technology which enables computers to decipher human emotions. There has been some debate on whether or not schools should incorporate this new technology into their computers to see how a student is feeling. I personally believe that using this new technology in the classroom is valuable for a few reasons.

One reason why I think that this technology would be valuable in schools is so that teachers can use this information to see if they way they are teaching is effective. If the software finds that a student is extremely bored or confused then, a teacher may decide to change up their teaching strategy and start doing something that will not bore students and give them all the possible chances they can get to learn. One of the creators of this software, Dr. Huang supports this belief as well by saying ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"".

Another reason why this technology would be vital in schools is to see how students are doing mentally. The stresses of school and other things often gets to students especially in high school but they usually choose not to seek help when they need it. So if this technology could tell when a student is feeling stressed or sad an adult could start getting them the help that they need to feel better. Teachers could also use this information to tell if they are giving out too much stressful and strenuous work and need to cut down on it some. The technology that has been created is pretty much tested and approved as well, ""imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad,"" is stated to show how effective the software would be in finding a students emotions.

So I definitely believe that incorporating this technology into schools would help in many different ways and is very valuable. It would help teachers alter their plans to incorporate more fun lesson plans that keep students participating but also gets the point across so students actually learn. In another way it could help school staff help students in need who may be depressed or stressed out. These are just a few ways that this technology could help out of the many possibilities that the software could be used for.",4

Yes i think this technology to read all emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. it is valuable because sometimes people really do be going though things and they never want to tell u. So if u use this technology then u will be able to find out people emotions just by using a program.The program tells you what you are exactly feeling, In paragraph 1 it says"" she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This shows that the program takes time to scan all your emotions

Also the technology goes in depth and tells you emotions that you wouldnt be able to point out by just looking at someone's face.The program goes in depth and looks at your muscles to determine your emotion and knows what gestures determines it. In paragraph 8 it says"" muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crows's feet around your eyes"". This shows that the program takes alot of information to be able to give you your stats on your emotions.

This shows that the technology is a great thing to have. Its a great thing to have because it determines how you are exactly feeling at a time.

6f37696,"In the article, the author implies the idea that studying Venus is a worthy endeavor despite its many dangers. By using examples, descriptive details, and more, the author supports this claim very well.

For example, in paragraph 3, the author states that ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"". This example show the evident danger that Venus holds.

One example being when the author says, ""astonomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Eath-like planet in our solar system"". This shows that the author believes that Venus is a worthy planet to be explored despite the danger it holds.

Another example of how the author supports theri claim is that they used factual information in the article. An example of this is in paragraph 5,where the author states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray...at thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"". This is one of the many factual statements throughout the article that shows the support of the author's claim.

The author also says this statement at the end of the article saying, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginations and innovation"". This shows that the author also believes that Venus is worth exploring because they give their own opinion about the future expeditions of man and how they should forever expand exploration. In conclusion, the author support their claim that Venus should be explore despite its evident dangers by using factual information, personal opinions, and descriptive details about the exploration of Venus, showing that they believe it should be explored because of the challenges it presents.",4
0cdb059,"My dream job was to become a scientist. I finally accomplished my goal, but it was a lot of hard work. Being a scientist is not an easy job! I had learned about ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" and now i have to interview with Mrs. Sally Backbone because she thinks the face was created by aliens when I beg to differ!

Ms. Breadwill here to do an interview with Mrs. Backbone, because she thinks ""Unmasking the Face in Mars"" was made by aliens. I've did some research and i have all the answers to your questions Mrs. Backbone. Let's Get Started! "" Few scientist believe the Face was an alien artifact and i think they are right"" said Mrs. Backbone. "" Well your certainly not wrong Mrs. Backbone, but cheif Jim Garvin told us "" We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it, plus what about in the years of 1998 and 2001."" replied Ms. Breadwill. I immedeitly showed Mrs. Backbone the photos that were taken in the year of 1998 and in the year of 2001 and she was speechless.

Mrs. Backbone had another question for Ms. Breadwill (me). I told Mrs. Backbone to let all the questions she needed to answer be said. Mrs. Backbone told me that The Face on Mars was located at 48 degrees south martain latitude. Ms. Breadwill shook her head and replied "" Your wrong, because the scientists and I studied and found out that The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martain latitude."" Mrs. Backbone was once again speachless and i think i seen her roll her eyes. "" Mrs. Backbone how are you feeling?"" Ms. Breadwill commented. Mrs. Backbone simpliy sighed and said "" Can we move on to the last question?""

Mrs. Backbone had one more question, and i was hoping it wasn't too hard since I have been answering all her questions correctly. Mrs. Backbone said, "" the Face is not a natural landform and I still believe there is an alien monument. I sighed and told her she was wrong once again. She yelled "" How?!"" I simpliy told her On April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" I also told her on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view."" She asked me ''Was that all?'' Ms. Breadwill told Mrs. Backbone one last thing and it was "" What the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" Mrs. Backbone had all her questions answered, so I believe that my work here is done!

I am Ms. Breadwill,and I am a scientist at NASA. If you need questions answered about the Face on Mars, then I am the one to help you. I will answer all your questions whether they are easy or very difficult. I believe I am the best scientist in all America.",3
a43833f,"How did the author suppored his idea?

The author supports his idea of "" Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers"" by explaining how dangerous Venus is. Some examples of what the author said about how dangerous is to explore Venous are;

"" A thick atmosphere of Almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus"". ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus'd atmosphere"". "" Venus has the hottests surface temperature of any in oure solar system, even though Mercury is the closer to our sun"".

One of the reasons that the author said why ""studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers"" is, "" A thick Atmosphere of Almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Vanus"" which meants that it make dangerous for the people who wants to go explore to Venus to past the atmosphere of Venus, another reason that can make dangerous for the people to past Venus's atmosphere is, ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. One more reason about why is dangerous for the who people wants to explore Venus is "" Venushas the hottest surface temperature of any in our solar system, even thoug Mercury is the closest to our sun"" this means that the hottest of Vanus can put in risk the health of the people who wants to study the land.

In conclution, the author supported well his Idea about studying Venus is a "" worthy pursuit despite the dangers"" by explaining the dangers of trying to go through the atmosphere, the dangers of land in Venus and how can land in vanus can put in risk the health of th epeople who wants to earn knolledge about Venus.

3dee2b1,"For decades, society has put a major emphasis on transportation in order to center themselves around cars and ways to upgrade them. However, it is this frame of that mind that has created issues for modern society. If there were limitations put on the usage of cars, then those rules would help maintain the environment, save car owners money, and create a feeling of bliss and serenity that has disappeared since the mass production of cars. So unless change is brought upon society, then people will be passing up on benefits that would better the whole world.

Scientist have long realized that cars are a major cause to the pollution brought into society. From the waste produced while turning precious oil into gasoline, to the engines in millions of cars simultaneously burning gas. It is for this reason that limiting the use of cars would assist in saving and maintaining the environment. According to Robert Duffer, the author of the article ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Somg"", ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intesifying smog."" What is also noteworthy is that this experiment by France officials was only in place for a matter of days. So after having smog that repotedly rivaled Beijing, China, the smog capital of the world, the smog that inhabited France was more than cut in half. If this can work in such a large scale like France, then it isn't unreasonable to believe that this same process can be done in other major regions. Saving the environment has become a priority around the world in recent years, and the idea of limiting the usage of cars could help to achieve that goal.

Aside from the fact that the limitation of cars can save the environment, it can also save car owners money. When a person stops at a gas station to fill up their car, they can expect to spend between twenty and fifty dollars. However, if cars were to become less relevant, then this money can be used to fund other important aspects of a persons life. While this might seem far-fetched, according to Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, ""the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter."" This analysis helps to justify the fact that cars can eventually become less relevant and thus save people money. Also, money would be saved on not having to repair and maintain a car, or having to buy a car in general. This alone can save a car-owning household thousands of dollars each year.

Saving the environment and money are always an obvious choice when explaining the benefits of limiting car usage, but another benefit would be obtaining bliss and serenity around the globe. Since the mass producion of cars, cities are always filled with the irritating sounds of a lively road. This has left many people to enjoy their walks, not to the sounds of children laughing and people conversing, but to the beeping and screeching of cars. However, in a city in Germany called Vauban, officials have successfully created a peaceful city that relies on walking and public transportation instead of cars. According to Heiden Walter, a media trainer and citizen in Vauban, ""When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This quote goes to show that the citizens don't feeled resticted, but released from their reliance on cars. So although it may seem difficult, putting limitations on cars can create a happier populants.

Putting a limitation on the use of cars would not be a punishment like some would see it, but a way to better society. This limitation would help save and maintain the environment, save car owners money, and create bliss and serenity amongst people. As modern society continues to push forward and develop the next wave of advancements, putting limitations on the use of cars should be seen as a serious inquiry to leaders around the world.    ",5
4274e29,"Dear Mr. Senator,

The Electoral College is a unfair system used for voting the reprentative of our nation. Bigger states with a bigger population get more votes, and smaller states get less votes. Its not completely fair, but then again when is politics fair? If the majority of big states are all a certain paty (either democrst or republican) them the entire system is thrown off, unfair, and unbalanced. Its much more fair if the people of the United States vote amd the votes were to be counted as individuals and not grouped to see which has the greater percentage and then given a certain number of votes to that party's candidate.

Although the process I think will be fair does include greater numbers, the government has equipment such as computers to do the counting for each person. This system is rigged and unjust. It is the opposite of what America and its foundation is all about - equality. I would like yout to take this to washington and even if you get scrutinized and pestered, you should ride forth because lots of Americans think this system is corrupt and if we want our voices and opinions to be heard there is no one else we can tell but you. So represent us small town people of LOCATION_NAME, represent the nation in undergoing a process that will finally make our country one of equality.

Sincerely,

294cfe5,"Driverless cars should be developed and permited. If more car companies would form and release this idea of driverless cars that would be one less problem people would have to worry about, because everyone would save much more money than they usualy do, and people without cars wouldn't have to worry about getting places. Even though Google has already had cars that could drive by themselves they were not all the way driverless. Human would have to take over when the cars couldn't do what humans can.

The law specificly says that cars are only safe when a human driver is at full control of the vehicle at all times. The law needs to lighten up and approve of driverless cars because it would help everyone all for the better. It will also make us more advanced by discovering new things with better technology. In a few years of so more and more states will have accepted the idea of autonomous cars, laws are going to be changed, and everything will work out just fine.

6a88ff3,"It is reasonable that the mask shown up on Mars' surface is not an alien. In order for a creature to live somewhere it has to be the right environment. As the artice ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" said the creature or ""alien mask "" was very large. Planet Mars is not nearly big enough to have creatures with the head size of a whole mile to fit. Just think your body is much more bigger than your head. A head that steratches two miles ear to ear in a very large head, just imagine how large the body would be!

Over time land can begin to crak or break. Something could have been going on inside Mars' crust ,for instece here on Earth we have earthquakes, that could have happened on Mars. It has been said that it is common for figures to start to appear from a region in Mars called Cydonia.

to apperar on Mars' surface is normal as it was stated in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". Therefore I do not know what makes people think an alien has just magicaly apperared on the face of Mars. For thousandes of years scientist have invented ways to look at planets, take pictures of them, even get a little sample of the planet.

191ef7e,"As a teacher imagine being able to have more students engaged with a class lesson that they enjoy, this can very well be the future at some point in time with new technology such as the Facial Action Coding System.

The FACS can percieve the emotions of others and send feedback as to which emotions they are feeling which is valuable information within a classroom setting.

In paragraph 6 it states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""

""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

This is valuable information as it allows the teacher or instructor to modfiy the lesson so that it corresponds with the students emotion which in return allow for more students to be engaged with a class lesson.

This new technology also allows for the instructor to be able to empathize with a student that may be feeling sad or distrought.

In paragraph 9 it states that ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may produce them."" this means that the instructor can use the feedback to put on a ""happy face"" to empathize with the students more which means that if you're smiling anyone around you is more likely to smile and empathize aswell.

These are multiple reasons as to why I believe that the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom setting is valuable, not only to the teacher's success, but the students' aswell.",3
184bad3,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) could be useful for people that are not around you enough that you have no idea what they are feeling but in most cases most people can tell when their friend is feeling down or not.""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can problably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect. Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" This shows that most people do not know the specific traits that describe the emotion but most people also know that when their friend or family memeber makes a certain facial expresion that they are either happy, sad, mad, or even annoyed.

People can figure things out without needing a machine to do things for them. Maybe for paintings the FACS can be useful but not on ordinary people who know when their friend is feeling down or not. People do not need technology to do everything for them. People need to do things on their own make conclusions to things and if they have no idea what their friend or family is feeling they can just ask. ",2
a8cc71f,"It sounds insane to even suggest whether or not to impliment a new system of computers taht can identify the emotions of students in a classroom. However, this is not because of the idea of the software but the absurtidy of truly modifying the education system around each individual student at once. It is beyond beneficial to students to impliment this system, it is revolutionary. It may be the first time in all of history that education is able to acomidate every student in the class room and ensure their success. The Facial Action Coding System should be implimented into classrooms to read teh emotional expressions of students in order to ensure their greatest success and the furthur success of the school.

These computers do so much more than read what is on a students face. They are able to determine emotions that maybe the student is not aware of or denies. This can determine what the student really loves and are interested in. This could eliminate unwanted or unessisary classes that prove no benefit to the students future based on their interests. To be able to change the curriculum around every student is to maintain a steady growth of every person into what they truly want and deserve to me. If science is a field of much interest, it would be easily determined by small changes in facial movements. This could allow for students to identify fields to pursue, making it easier and more enjoyable in the classroom. To continue down a path of true passion is more beneficial to everyone in the situation. D'Alto refers to a simular idea, saying that ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow"" (D'Alto 6). Like advertisement, students would be able to follow a steady stream of interest, insuring the best and more satisifying education possible. By being able to elimnate certain subjects or topic that peak no interest, students would find themselves more involved and more passionate about the subject rather than simply turning away from all subjects due to the poor outcome or little interest in one. It is astounding that lack in interest in one subject can turn a student away from school. The Facial Action Coding System would not only help students with their interests, but keep them from turning their backs on school completely.

Although the students are mainly in charge of their education, teaching style is also a large portion of how a student learns or does not. If a student is bored, confused, or uninterested, it could be how they are being taught. How one person learns is not universal. However, ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" (D'Alto 4). If students were able to be placed with teachers who would acomodate them the best based on learning styles in cohesion with teaching styles based on the science behind their facial expressions, grades would be higher and students will have a higher sucess rate. It is not fair to blame a teacher for a students inablity to learn in their environment, however it is the responsiblity of the school to place a student in their space to learn. By being able to determine how a student reacts to certain moments in a class or activities, schools would be able to change their curriculum and place students with teachers who would most benefit. This technology would produce better outcomes for schools, creating a new system of aulmni that are more likely to succeed in their field and therefore more thankful and loving towards their previous school. To blame the student or the teacher for the lack of communication is unfair since ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" (D'Alto 6). To give students and teachers the opportunity to truly open up new possiblities of communication through technology is revolutionary because of the better relationships that would form if all involved are on the same page.

Many may argue that this technology takes away the part of humanity that is working with others who disagree. However, if humanity was able to perfect a system so that everyone was happier, would anyone truly disagree? Once out of school, if students were able to immediatly pursue a career in their interest and work with people who share this, they are again being placed in an environment best suited for them. This technology could not only eliminate unessisary classes or subjects but stress. If everyone was in pursuit of their passions, living their best lives, would anyone feel the need to aggresively brual or disaggree? This technology may not completely eradicate disaggrences, but it may eliminate unessisary arguments or issues. The Facial Action Coding System enables students to live and learn to their full potential while also benefitting teachers and schools. By enabling students to take charge of their education, success rates will reach unthinkable numbers. ",6
458a223,"""Unmasking the face on Mars."" Is it created by aliens or not? some may think it's a face created by aliens but we have some evidence to state that the face on Mars is certainly not created by aliens, just another weird formation just like on earth.

The Face on Mars is not created by aliens beacuse when doing research we were able to find that a rock may have hit and the formation of the rock formed to a face. If it ""were"" that aliens had created that it would be impossible especially it being two miles big, we would've seen the aliens. Just like on earth there are weird looking formations that have us saying if it's even possible for it to be here on earth. The unusual shadows that made it look like Egyptian Pharoahs had us thinking twice but it defintely was a councidence. On April 5, 1998 when Mars Surveyor flew over Cyondia for the first time they found it it was just a natural land form and was no alien monumeant after all.

There is more evidence to stating that The Face on Mars was not created by aliens than there is stating that aliens did form it thats why we as in Nasa belive The Face on Mars was a natural landform.   ",2

I, myself went to China and Eruope. Though that wasn't all, for me I thought going to Arcopolis in Greece was awesome. So was taking a trip to a gondola ride in Vinice, Italy, which is a city with streets of water, it was amazing! I also went to a castle in Crete and the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboys Program can also be a bucket full of fun!

Especially when were on our return trips after the animals have been unloaded. We (The cowboys) played a bunch of fun games that keeped us ocupied and having fun! We played some of our sports were there was empty hold were the animals had been housed. In those places we played sports such as baseball and vollyball. We also played Table-Tennis tournaments, boxing , fencing , and whittling. Reading was another thing to do to pass the time, but not as fun as the sports!

2ec88c1,"Driverless cars can cause a lot of different problems like the safety of pedestrians,how realistic are driverless cars, and how driverless they really are.

Driverless cars can be a huge safety issue. If a driverless car hit somebody whos fault would it be the driver or the company? Also there are really no laws pertaining to driver less cars. That could be a huge problem when people do bad things, because they can not really get in trouble because it is not illegal. Driverless cars seem like that coould never happen.

The cost for a driverless car can be very expensive. It takes a lot of technology to make a car doo everything on its own. The car would need sensors and possibly sensors in the roads but that is not realistic at all because it is way to expensive.Most driverless cars will also need an alert system to alert human to take over. A driverless car can be really expensive.

Another thing about driverless cars is how driverles are the really? According to the passage all of the driverless cars out today still have to alert you when the car can not drive through a road block or an accident and other things like that. So when having a driver less car you will still have to be alert at all times just incase you need to take ove rthe road. The problem with that is whats the point of having a driverless car when you have to stay alert the whole time.

594c67c,"Technology and enhancement in vehicles have come a long way. Each year companies come out with new cars and new features that gives people the desire to but them. Driverless cars have been in discussion for many years and have been worked on for those many years. Corrperations, such as GM, have developed a system that vibrates the driver seat when the vehicle is in danger of hitting another vihicle while backing up. Other ideas, such as the windshield having flashing lights, have also been discussed. But this is just the beginning of driverless cars. Driverless cars should not yet be implied in today's society due to lack of technology developement.

Driverless cars cannot be released into the world because of lack in testing the cars to see if they function correctly. Many states have made laws that provent companies from testing these cars due to safety laws. Another point to look at is how much the driver would actually pay attention if they have a driverless car. If one is behind the wheel of a driverless car, they would not want to operate, but rather do something of importance to themself. If the driverless car is put out there, the driver would not want to have to take over, which they would have to at some points of the journey. Most laws are made to provide safety for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. If the technology and functions behind the driverless car fail and cause injury, whose to say is at fault? The driver or the technology could both be at fault for causing injury. Of course driverless cars would be convenient and better for gas usage, but our technology is not developed enough to pursue driverless cars.

Although driverless cars have been in discussion and worked on for many years, we are not yet ready as a society to begin the idea of letting them on roads. Because of lack in technology developement, safety, lack of testing, and the careless drivers who would be behind the wheel, our society is not ready for this function to be on the road. Yes, the car itself has benifits, but the negatives out weight the positives. ",3
57581cd,"The"" ""Face"" may look like it's a human face but it's not. Anything can make anything look drastic or cool. But there is no way that it could be a human inside of Mars. It's way to sketchy for it to be like that. So I'm gonna go ahead and tell you why I think this is why I don't think it is a human at all.

The face structure hasn't changed any of those pictures. If it was human, in a couple of months or years (maybe), your body becomes rotton and turn into nun but bones. If it was human, then it would have body parts along side with it. There's no body parts near it except rocks and holes. Besides, the picture look like it was taking from a pretty far distance for the head is bigger then that boulder next to it.

The fact that I know that it's not a face, notice how by years go by, the face starts looking like an sand temple. The thing with it is that on the top of it, it looks like another face on it, like a rebuilded electronic robot. But, when 2001 came by, it started looking like an a map or a super hard shell. All of these things that were on Mars looks different by the years. Now, in 2016, I bet it looks like a guided map to wear it started to wear it landed at.

There's no doubt that this is just some random structure because there were no oxygen, nor water, on mars, in 1976. It's pretty much impossible to live there unless, your from NASA. Then again, there still are rumors about alien's existing. So what if there was a alien who killed an human and left it there? If you notice now, the structure of the ""Face"", how it fades away, it starts looking like an cracked shell.

I want to believe that there is life on Mars, but the thing is that Mars ""probably"" have alien's there. As no one has thought about it, alien's could be legit. Just because we see a face on Mars means one thing, but the fact that it's whole entire bottom half of it's neck-to-bottom part is gone. Just because it changed up doesn't mean,""Oh, it must have cleared up since it's been there for a while"". I doubt that because, no human being can walk on Mars with no protection on that can keep him/her alive. If your going to Mars, make sure you need a quite bit of protection. But, if you actually do see an alien, just run, because it's best staying alive instead of wind up dead in the middle of no were on Mars.",2

Being bound by thoughts will lilmit our satisfacation of curiosities of humanity being met. Not only should we meet the challenge of travelling to Venus, but exceed at it.

NASA is working on mehcanical parts and electronics that will be resistent to the dense pressure, heat, and other forces of Venus's surface. NASA is also thinking of vehicles that will make it possible to withstand the hostile conditions of Venus. Though they may have limited insight of the on ground conditions, the scientist will be be able to study what they can. Although this may be a challenge to them, they are innovating everyday to allow our machines to withstand and last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.

There are dangers along the way such as the extreme temperatures, the acidic atmosphere, and high pressure. But scientist are trying to make it possible for success of making equipment that will last through all of those hazords on Venus. Even with the problems along the way, scientist still work on ways to reach Venus beacuse it is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago it most likely covered by oceans and was able to support life.

In conclusion, figuring out a way to reach and study Venus for a long time period is worth the risk of failure. We will learn from our mistakes and study the conditions of the planet more to make it possible to actaullly be able to study and retrieve results from the planet surface.",3
1d21cf1,"I think driverless car would be a bad investment for car manufacturers. I think this way because driverless cars could caused more accidents, they aren't a hundred percent driverless, and you don't know that it will be efficient or not.

Driverless cars have sensors in them that apply force when there is danger but how can you be for certain that something won't block a specific necessity of the sensor and make the sensor invalid to apply force. If the sensor didn't detect a sign of danger when there was a pedistrian or wall or car in front of them. The cars sensors would not be able to automaticly brake. Some driverless cars also have cameras in them. How do we know that what the camera sees won't mistake it with a different action. The sensor on the roof updates the car with a 3-D image of its surroundings. This 3-D imaging could pick something up that is different than what it makes or it could make the thing it saw and apply force when they needn't be any.

The cars still need a little help from the humans when there is a road block, jam in traffic,work zones, or accidents. The car doesn't have the skills yet to navigate around things that can be in the way of the road or its course it was on. The driver will be alerted when the car has a difficulty and can't manage to reroute. These cars can handle only twenty-five MPH. Higher than that the driver itself will have to drive such like on a highway when you can go 60 to 70 MPH. Manufacturers have applied different kinds of alerts such as a vibrating seat, announcing itself, and another option could be flashing lights on the windshield. How do we know if those alerts will actually alert us. Everyone is difeferent and get alerted differently, how will the manufacturers know that any of these alerts will actually be affective to people.

So could driverless cars be effecient? They could in a sense, but most information about these cars and technology could be doubtful and guesses. All technology has its flaws and bugs that no one can fix. These driverless cars could mess up or brake whenever and the humans in the car would not know. Then their life would be in danger. Driverless cars have to much new technology that they can't be reliable.

Driverless cars have a lot more to work on before it's time to come out to drivers. Manufacturers should focus on accident prone cars, a hundred percent drivable, and if it will be efficient in todays society. ",4

951e252,"The laws have changed. We now have days where we cannot use our cars for the day. We can only get around using buses, a local taxi, bikes, walk etc,. Would this benefit us or would it not? Some cities and countries around the world are banning cars. Instead they would like to use public transportation, a biciylce, or maybe your own two feet to get around. I believe that this topic is reasonable and I agree.

The United States is considering this law of not having to use our cars for a day or two each week so we can get out in the fresh air or try out some new transportation for personal knowledge of more ways to get around. The paper, The End of Car Culture, states that ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Assuming, we are already shifting into a lifestyle of not having a car for a day or two. To me, this would benefit the country because of our high obesity rate. If more people ride their bikes to places or walk places, this will give them more exercise opportunities and help them lose weight in a more constructive way. Just riding your bike or walking a mile to the grocery store a day can definitely help someone out.

Speaking of helping things out, how about the environment? The article, Paris band driving due to smog, states that ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Robert Duffer also states that Paris uses Mondays to be deicated ro even-numbered license plates are ordered to leave their cars at home and the next day odd-numbered license plates were ordered to keep their cars home. The diesel fuel in Paris was hurting the environment so that is why they banned cars. Here in the United States I believe that the car pollution is also hurting our environment. Riding bikes and walking places is a good activity for everyone to do.

Most of us, except the 2% of people in America, have trouble with money. Riding bikes around and walking to a friends house or to the store, would definitely help our money situations. Not having a car two days a week means we do not have to get gas as much, which would save us money. Using a taxi would be useful too but, not as much becuase the money adds up also. Not using cars can completely help our community and country in so many ways.

Banning cars for a day or two sounds like a fantastic idea. Being able to go out and get fresh air and get some exercise would be great for our country. Less pollutions, less money and more constructive activities for getting around to places. All sounds like a good idea to me. Let's see if the United States takes action.                     ",4
92bb58b,"The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) program can be used to detect human emotion through complex algorithms on a advanced computer. Since this program cant work on the average PC, Dr. Huang wrote down some simple instructions that encode different emotions. These instrutions are not as advanced as the FACS program but they are simple enough for the average PC. This can dectect your muscular action units to detect all your current emotions. It can also detect fake emotions as if you were trying to fake a smile or frown just by looking at the major mucles on your face.

Dr. huang would like to use this program for kids in schools. He says the program would help detect when a student is becoming confused or bored of a lesson. When this happens the FACS program will modify the lesson such as an effective human instructor would. This in my opinion could change the learning process for many people and create a new learning system across the world. But this could also take many jobs away ruining the carrer of a teacher. This whole program could end horribly making teachers go on a strike. But no special computer is needed as in the article states that this program could run on a school computer.

All together this program could change schools for the students, and effect the jobs of teachers/professor. This program was made to detect human emotions but can be used as an advanced learning process. The things that this program can do are impressive but Dr. Huang aslo says that humans can also detect emotions. But a teacher can't teach every student in their ways needed, teachers teach the whole class using the technique. Overall this program should be tested in a few schools before going active to each school.   ",3

Now how it works is pretty cool. In the article it says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face."" This would help teachers read what emtion a student is giving during class.

How will this effect students and teachers. How would this help the teachers? The computer will scan the students face see if they are focusing in class or not. In the article says that the computer can read ""action unit"" which is, ""Movement of one or more muscles."" Telling if the student is focusing in class.

In paragraph 2 the supports his claim by informing us that ""Venus is sometimes right around the corner-in space terms- humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world"".

This adds on to why in Paragraph 3 that, ""on the pantes surface, tempatres average over 800 degrees Farhrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". Another reason in paragraph 3 is that ""Venus has the hottest surface tempatre o any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun"".

3178186,"Have you ever dreamed of being on another plante? Have you ever wondered what is the closest plante to Earth? Have you ever asked your self where would our next destination be? Well, in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does an amazing job on explaning these qustions and even more like:

why is Venus sometimes is called the Earths twin? What calenges we might face on Venus? and what is it like?

First, the author discuses the differens of the star Venus and the plante Venus. The star Venus

is usually the brightest star in the sky and often is referred to as the ""Evening Star"" but the plant Venus is the second closest plant to the sun and the closest plante to Earth and is often referred to as Earth's ""twin."" Venus is similar to Earth in many ways, some of wich are: density and size.

Next, we have not sent a singal spacecraft to Venus in almost 30 years. The reason behind the lack of missions to Venus is because Venus is souronde in a thick atmosphere that is made of 97 percent of carbon dioxide and many other factors that the author

discuses in paragraph three and four of the passage. The conditions on Venus are far more extrene than those on Earth. In the passage ir says the "" such an environment would crush

even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans.""

Finally, what is venus's crust like? and why are scientists thinking of sending anyone ther? In paragraph four and five the author explains how venuse might have ben once the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Today, venus still has some Earth-like feuturs. Mountains, valleys, and craters are some of the future that you might find on Venus.

In conclusion, the author did a great job explaning why studying Venus is an important no matter what chalenges we might face. In the eighth paragraph the author said "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges os imagination and innovation."" I 100% agree with the author and thonk that we should prdue exploring outter spcae no matter what problems we might face.",2
371dcd9,"The Face on Mars is a natural landform. A few scientists believe that it is an alien artifact. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took pictures and revealed that the Face was only a natural landform. They also saw that there was no alien monument. Michael and his team said that if it was an ancient civilization, there would've been planes on the ground, Egytian-style pyramids, or small shacks.

NASA revealed the image and they said that it was a huge rock formation formed by shadows giving the illusion of the eyes, nose, and a mouth. The Face was only an illusion. NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft revealed that it is a mesa. Michael proved that it was a mesa because what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a mesa or butte. These are most common around the American West.

This natural landform is similar to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The landform in Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. Middle Butte is about the same height as the Face on Mars. This proves that the Face on Mars is just a landform.",3
81d3e02,"Throughout history, mankind has depended on hands-on work for critical purposes.

However, technology has evolved as a tool to assist us to do labor more efficiently and quickly.

It is an important decision whether or not to support driverless cars because it can affect the conflicts due to this choice.

Human error has been a common factor for automobile accidents across the nation, which has claimed many lives.

Driverless cars can be another tool for the human population that could save lives.

To begin with, manufacturers have tinkered on this project for many years by several strategies such as General Motors and their concept car that ran on a unique test track.

It began in the 1950s, using binary code to alert the car system.

Unfortunately, upgrades in that period of time were too expensive to be used widespread.

This began the alternative option of smarter cars, rather than intellegent roads to assist drivers.

Likewise, the government is obstinant on testing for every single liability smarter cars can be held for.

It is above all priorities for the smarter cars to ensure complete saftey from dangerous hazard conditions on the road.

To prevent such conditions, developers considered the use of driverless cars to assist drivers instead of total control at all times.

Furthermore, scientists and engineers have added ideas from each other, enabling cars to even sensor dangerous obstacles.

For example, the BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" is one of the many cars that can preform driverless to a certain extent, allowing for a human driver to access the controls if necessary.

This evidence concludes that driverless cars are potential as a wonderful tool to help in the saftey of others in a vehicle.

Driverless cars could be the next common technology among the human population like computers or phones.

From this, humanity will continue evolving and strive through conflicts similar to this subject.

However, another choice for us, individually is whether or not to accept change.               ",2
a66fe9b,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author argues the point that studying venus is a worthy pursuit, despite dangers that it can present. Throughout the article the author supports this idea with various forms of evidence. Ultimately, the author is ineffective at supporting their cclaim because they fail to provide sufficient factual evidence supporting it, jump to conclusions without providing sufficient logical reasoning, and provide significantly more evidence for the counter to their arguemnt than the arguement itself.

The author attempts to provide some factual basis for their claim that visiting Venus has worth, despite risks. They primarily included these in paragraph 4. The main ideas they used were that ""it (Venus) may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (4). This fact fails to support their argument, however, since the author does not provide any justification as to how it might make exploring Venus a more desireable option, especially considering the risks. It would make far more sense to simply explore a differnet planet that ws more hospitable and could actually be studied. The phrase ""once have been"" is also very telling. Certainly Venus is no longer at all Earth like save for its geology, as the planet has vastly different conditions to Earth in almost every other aspect. The author also states that Venus can ""sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit"" (4). This fact also fails to support their conclusion that there is worth in exploring Venus, because the planet is only sometimes the closest option. At other times Mars is closer to Earth than Venus. If this is the case, then it would make far more sense to explore Mars as it is far less hostile to life than Venus is. The author again fails to provide sufficient logical evidence to validate the conclusion that Venus is worth the risk, especially because there is a safer alternative that is sometimes even closer than Venus.

In addition to failing to provide sufficient factual evidence in support of their argument, the author also jumps to conclusions before actually connecting any logical reasoning to them in order to justify said conclusions. The author concludes at the end of the fourth paragraph that ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable."" (4) . However, they failed to provide any effective reasoning as to why this is the case. It would seem that the author began with this conclusion, but failed to actually justify it. It is certainly disputable that there is value in returning to Venus, so coming to such a strong conclusion on such flimsy evidence is simply ridiculous. It is simply another example of how the author faied to effetively support their claim.

Finally, the author provides significantly more evidence for the counter to their argument, than they do for the argument itself. Throughout the article the author gives details about how incredibly inhospitable Venus is to human life. For example, they state ""On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit"" (3), and ""the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"" (3). By providing this evidence the author is attempting to acknowledge the detractors to their argument and then provide a rebuttal to it. However, the author provides a much greater wealth of evidence for the idea that Venus is wholly inhospitable than they do for the idea that this difficulty is worth it. They provide only two brief facts on why exploration might be necessary, but have an example of how dangerous Venus is in nearly every paragraph. Ultimately this causes the claim that Venus exploration is worth the risk to lose validity because it creates a perception amongst the readers that the risks associated with the exploration of Venus far outweigh the benefits. It also contributes to an overall lack of focus in the article as the author constantly interjects facts about Venus' dangers.

Ultimately this author does a poor job at supporting the claim that exporing Vesus is a worthy pursuit despit the risks due to their lack of factual evidence, tendency to jump to conclusions, and the overwhelming surplus of evidence for the counter to the argument. These iniptitudes create a failure of an argument which is unable to stand up to even mild scrutiny.",6
3db9328,"Venus is sometimes called Earths twin. Whyit is called that is

because Venus is the closest planet to earth. How Venus is the closest planet to earth is because of the size and density. Occcasionally it is the closest distance to earth too. Venus atomsphere is almost 97 percent carbon. Should humans study Venus if even there are great dangers with it.

One reason it should not be futher studided is because most forms of light cannot pentrate the atomsphere. This affects them by not being able to take pictures and or videos. What they would have to do if they cannot take pictures or videos is make a base and study Venus from there. Thats alot of work bringing materials up there to make a base to study venus. The point is it would be a pain to bring materials up there make a base then try to study it which they might not be able to do.

Second thing about Venus is you cannot take samples from a distance. How are astromners supposed to get samples if they can barley see up close because light cannot pentrate the atomsphere? What are they going to do take a pick axe or a drill and just start mining. What if some piceases of the planet are explosive at they hit a part of the planet then it explodes. What are they going to do if that happens?

Third is why would we study the planet if pretty much we cant live on it. If the light cannot pentrate the atomsphere what are we going to do live in the dark. Humans cannot live in 170 degrees fahrenheit unless some how they can adapt or get everybody suits to wear. Astronmers say that Venus long ago was coverd in lakes and mountains like earth is now. If they find that water is on Venus it would be a good study if not it would not be worth it.

Should humans go more indepth in studying venus even though there are alot of dangers? No there are too many dangers and what could they get out of it.

Also, there is plenty of life-like landforms created with the surface of the area. Just so it happens to be on a planet doesn't mean there has to be a wild explanation to this landform. There is life-like landforms that sometimes look a a full body and there are some that look like half of a body. Many of those landforms have been scientifically proven to be just a landform.

0aaae26,"Dear senator, the system we have today used to elect the president, the Electoral College, must be changed.  Instead, we should elect the president by means of a popular vote.  The Electoral College is unecessary and complicated, and not to mention, outdated.  Source 1 says that the Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers.  This begs the question, how can a system so old still be practical and in use today?  This system, therefore, needs to be replaced by a national popular vote.

There are so many things that could go wrong with the Electoral College, such as a tie, in which the decision would go to the House of Representatives.  According to Source 2, if this were to happen, than, ""the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""  This, of course, would not reflect the nation's vote, and would anger millions of people.  If we elected the president by a popular vote, than the chances of this happening would be significantly more slim.

Another flaw of the Electoral College is that even if a presidential nominee won the popular vote, they could still lose the election.  Even though some may argue that this occasion is highly unlikely, this has actually happened twice before, in 1888 and 2000, according to Source 3.  ""It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote... It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.""  This is a major flaw of the Electoral College system, which is very frustrating to millions of people.  Imagine how you would feel if your candidate won the majority of the nation's vote, but still lost the election because of this horrible voting system.  This unfair incidence could be avoided, if only we got rid of the Electoral College, and replaced it with the simple, fair, and straightforward method of the popular vote.

The popular vote is the preferred voting system in the United States.  According to Source 2, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""  If this is the preferred voting system, and the Electoral College has so many flaws, why not change to using the popular vote?  It only makes sense.  Not to mention, if the Electoral College were to be thrown out, then maybe more people would come out to vote, which is important. We would then have a more accurate representation of who the nation wants as their leader.

Some may argue that the Electoral College is a good system of electing the president, that the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they established it, and that it ""produces a clear winner,"" (Source 3.)  But, the information given above disproves these unvalid arguements.  If the Electoral College is such a great system, than why can a nominee who won the majority of the nation's votes still win the election?  Will it always produce a clear winner?  What about the event of a tie?  Or, what about when the ""winner"" did not win the majority of the votes?

In conclusion, the replacement of this flawed system known as the Electoral College by a national popular vote is absolutely necessary.  The people are pushing for a change, and I strongly urge you, senator, to acknowledge this issue.    ",5
d466e78,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author statest that "" no spacecraft survived the landing for more that a few hours."". The atmosphere around Venus is made up of nearly 97 percent carbon dioxide and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on planet Earth. So why should we try again?

Astronomers claim that Venus may once have been the most Earht-like planet in our solar system which intrigues them. They believe that there is a way to make the mission back to Venus both safe and scientifically productive. The author backs up his idea are of why it would it would be a worthy pursuit by saying ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. They also claim that if they were not able to land on Venus they would have no way to get any samples of rock, gas, or anything else. With better equipment that is suitable for such hazardous environments then they believe there should be nothing stopping them from landing on Venus.

Overall, after reading this article, I believe that the author fully backed up his reasoning for why ""studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite of the dangers it presents."". If we continue to make new discoveries and try new things, we will have endless posibilities and new things to learn everyday. Like the author said "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.",2
35fafb1,"Do you think that people would rather have the popular vote for the president of the United States or the Electoral College? If some of you guys dont know what an Electoral College is, then it is a process, not a place. The process consists of the selection of the electors, by the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Now that you know its basiclly like your not even getting to have a chance at what you want, and not even a chance at getting to say what you want. That is why you would agree with me on the fact that we no longer should have the Electoral College. The voters & people in our country should strongly agree with having the election by popular vote. I think this because the Electoral College is unfair to voters and also the people in our country. Their are many of reasons on why I chose for it to be changed. One reason is because letting it be by popular vote might decress the conflict between people when one doesn't get what they want also might help the election be more equal. My next reason on changing the Electoral College is because if they run close then more people would be intrested and want more to do with the public election. It might even help the states from having conflict beween each other, and that would help our counrty out alot! We could also keep up with the candidates to make sure that us ""our self"" is picking the right person to be our presedent of the United States.

If this year goes like last year did then we might have a chance at getting to have the election by popular vote for the President of the United States. 2000 was the biggest election crisis in a century; that system allows for much worse. In 2000, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all, also Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in twentyfive of the largest media markets didn't get to see one campaign ad. The Electoral college is too unfair, way outdated, and irrational. The Electoral College needs to be Abolished. Better sooner then never.                                                ",2
7e02485,"Driverless cars can be the next big thing in the world. There are many ways how technology could imrove in a future. Just imagine how esier it's gonna be for you to not drive a car when you tired, or you don't have to worry about drunk drivers, or people who driving over the speed limit.

In example these cars would know how to drive and take you whatever you want while you texting or speaking on your phone. They would know the speed limit so speeding wouldn't be possible. You wouldn't have to worry about car accidents.

Secondly, as started in the article, these cars would use half of fuel of today's taxis and ofer far more flexibity than a bus. So many people complain about spending so much money on gas. Gas is realy issue but with these cars you don't have to worry about because these cars not only would save your money but also be better for enviorment.

Lastly, we need improvments in our world. You see on the news a lot of accidents involving cars. For an example, car crashes, people geeting hit by the cars, or drinking and driving are a lot of problems. Having these cars we would change our future by saving so much lives.

In conclusion, these cars could prevent accidents, stop drinking and driving, tale less gas, and improve our future. After hearing those reasons how could you not support driverless cars? Advancing to driverless cars could be the great thing for our world.",3
c428c7b,"i dont believe that driverless cars would be a good influence on our population. I say that because i dont think people would use these cars as good use. People wouldnt use these cars for good reason because they would take advantage of it because it can drive on its own, I know it would have a built in camera for our eyes on the road but lets just be real here noone will even take a glance at the road. These cars are really smart cars and all but what does this car do for us? I really think these cars wouldnt do us any good because none of us wouldnt want to drive anymore because it drives on its own therefore that would make us all lazy drivers. im sure these cars know alot but they probably dont know the importance of driving under roads that are under construction, or bad weather, slick roads. Which concerns me of all of our safety, and all our lives at risk. What if the roads are very slick and its foggy outside? i dont think the car can drive through that type of weather because at times it is very hard for us humans to drive under that condition.

Most of us have children and passengers while driving with us all the time i am very concerned of their safety too, what if they are not comfortable with these cars, they want you to take control of the wheel. We all have our opinions on things but these cars i really dont like the idea of it. Like money wise the cars would cost us millions probably for it and there are more important things in the world to buy, we really dont need to spend all our money on these cars. Gas money for these cars what if these cars use a lot of gas?

We would have to spend like another 80 to 90$ on gas too. The car what if the car alert system or camera stops working?

We have no other choice but to take the wheel, it shouldnt take all that money for a car and for something to happen to it and we have to end up driving it anyways, so we shouldnt even have this idea of these cars in my opinion its a waste of money. In conclusion i dont think it would be a good idea for us to have this new source of techinology because most of us wont even use it right and it could cause all kinds of problems. ",3

The author finds it intersting when it comes to Venus, he's not the only one other people also would like to go to Venus in see what is in Venus or how Venus looks in face to face seeing it with your own eyes in flying out your self.

Earth levels won't be the same, ""Researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to out knowledge of venus."".

1b31f9f,"I think that this new technology can be valuable in many different ways. It can help teachers know why a student is acting different. It can also help teachers know why the kid is not turning in his homework. If the kid is getting in to trouble fighting in school teachers can use this to know why he is doing this to see wat is wrong or how he feels.

If a student is acting different in class teachers can use this new technology to identify his emotions and see why he is acting different. That way teachers can know why and maybe have a little talk with him. So that he stops acting the way he is n stop being disrespetful.

This new technology can also help the teachers know why this kid is not turning in his work. He may not turn in his work because he is sad or is not feeling good if teachers know this then they can talk to the kid and help him start turning his work in so that he can pass his classes and graduate.

If a student is getting into trouble, fighting , talking bad to teachers. The principles can use this knew technology to know why he is doing this or how he is felling maybe there is stuff going on at home and he is felling sad and angry at the same time. If teachers know then they can help this kid out and start to meke the kid make good choices.

Well this is why i think the use of this technology is valuable. hoefully we will have this someday i think that it will be really helpful and usefull for teachers i think they will use it a lot to find out how students are feeling or their emotions.                                           ",3
ec26165,"By centering the article around technology that that is able to read students' emotions, Nick D'Alto makes a great case that this developement would be a direct benefit to the learning environment. If this new technology is implemented in schools, educators will see test scores rise and see positive behavioral effects in children because of the use of emotion reading technology.

One of the most important aspects to consider when designing an education experience is whether or not it is beneficial, and more importantly, if it will keep students engaged. Dr Huang theorizes is paragraph 6 that a classroom computer could recognize when a student becomes distracted or confused, and the computer could alter the lesson and make it more useful. This could largely impact the education system by allowing each and every individual student to have a customized lesson plan based on their reactions to the origional one. With this new innovation, schools could become more efficient and churn out more successful students than ever before.

One of the many duties a teacher has is educating the students, but one of the most important roles a teacher can play in a students life is implementing discipline. As described in paragraph 8, this technology has the ability to screen people on whether they are being truthful or deceitful. Just like lying politicians, kids can get away with a lot. If bad habits continue to follow them throughout school, they will end up with a criminal potential later in life. Emotion reading technology could possibly save a students future if the teacher could read if the kid is being truthful or not. If a young child is found to be lying, the teacer could effectively discipline the kid and end the bad habit at an early age. Another example would be if kids are really telling the truth if they understand the lesson or not. If kids are truly confused and won't admit it, the emotion sensing technology would read their faces and the teacher would be alerted that the students don't undestand the lesson. These forms of accountability would instill morals and discipline in children and prevent them from forming bad habits at a young age, and eventually lead to a better and more just society.

Overall, emotion reading technology would be a strong benefit to society and specifically the education system. By being able to understand eachother better, the human population has the ability to evolve and become more intelligent, compassionate, and responsible. If it takes a new technology to bring people a higher understanding of eachother, than that technology should be implemented in not just the education system, but many other institutions around the world.

facc03a,"I believe that using the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System will be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can calculate the emotional expressions that are given on your face. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the faces. This calculating can result in to participation in the classroom. It can tell what all the students are feeling so the teacher can help them to get back to work on what subject they are working on.

There are muscles that can signify what a person is feeling, and the FACS can do that job. The FACS then looks at the characteristic of the movements in the face. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. And they figure out these emotions by comparing a neutral face, which is showing no emotion. Humans also use this method to see how or what someone feels.

The FACS is really valuable to read the faces of students in a classroom. Its expected to show brilliant work in the software industries. And the FACS can modify the lessons on how the classrooms feelings are. The FACS is the next software to be used. And i think it is valuable to use in a classromm of students.",2
09fc519,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System sounds like an excellent idea. It would allow schools to make classes more enjoyable for students. Teachers would know if the students are understanding the lessons. Teachers could know if students are stressing and help them calm down. The software would help provide better data for researchers. The program would benefit both students and teachers. It would also make getting data for research easier.

With the use of the new software, schools can provide a better learning environment. The program can tell people how the students respond to lessons and how they are taught. Teachers can take this information and use it to better their classrooms. They can make their lessons more interactive and fun. The software would allow for more labs to be performed in science classes. It might inspire students to go into science fields if they enjoy the F.A.C.S.

The technology could help teachers recognize struggling students. Many students will not say that they need help, even if they do. Teachers may be able to help brighten a student's day, so they do not spend the rest being sad. This could help prevent school ""accidents"" and keep the school's environment ""happier."" The F.A.C.S could help teachers know when the students need a minute's break to help them refocus.

The software could help researchers collect better data faster. Researchers would not need to go to schools to collect information. They could just take it from the program directly. This could help them improve the technology and make it more efficient. The information would help in other studies regarding schools or students. It could also alert people to dangers in the classrooms by detecting whenever students are scared.

The F.A.C.S would make the classrooms of schools better. They could make students safer. The schools could receive better feedback on what works and what does not. Researchers would get better information for studies. The systems would benefit more than just one. ",4

The article state ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"".

d44e46c,"The state senator that is reading this should understand that in my favor keeping the Electoral College is the wise thing to do. It will avoid run-off elections and how it always has a process if something happens and that the process is fair-hence Electoral College would be the best.

To start off, the Electoral College helps with elections be cause it avoids run-off elections. In other words it keeps us from running into problem where neither candidate gets the majority of the the votes cast. For example, in 1968 president Nixon and Clinton in 1992 each had 43 percent of the popular votes but because their electoral votes  was 301 to 370 it does matter so this means it was a run-off election until the percentage of votes changed. The Electoral College soon produces a clear winner. This is just solving a problem where no candidate recieves the majority of votes. Now there is only one con to the Electoral College and that is that it may turn off people from voting because they believe that their vote out of everybody who votes isnt enough to do a difference so they dont even vote. So voters in presidential elections are way better than just one vote deciding an election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College is consisted of 538 electors. The candidate needs atleast 270 to be elected. If they have atleast 270 and there and they are not tied, but they have the same popular votes, also known as a plurality. The Electoral Colleges 538 electors will decide. This is 100 percent fair because those electors study this, they do this for their job, and they understand. They make up for the people who didn't vote. So just think, wouldnt you want 538 professional electors deciding whos president or 538 people who dont even want to vote and dont even know about the campaign to decide whos your president. All the lying about the Electoral College that it is an anachronism is false it is a success. This is common sense if you ask me.

To conclude, the electoral college has been good to us for a long time because of how it handles situations when they go wrong-hence it is the best, why change it now?                    ",4
2cfb8c4,"The use of this technology could be valuable in some ways. As to determine what emotion is being played here and such. But in some cases there are ways were use this in classroom can out right fail if not used right. We don't know how much this tech costs for schools everywhere to bring them into the learning curve.

That's the huge risk on this tech not knowing the cost.

This technolgy can be inaccurate in various ways of communcation. This is a machine and it's not going to 100% predict all the emotions or facial features that a human being does cause everyone is different. That's a big reason to not use it or have in school. While in some cases we will be able to have a machine that's able to somewhat pinpoint and pinpick what you are feeling in some way. That would be pretty neat but it's also why have this in classroom when some of us need to know how to read other peoples emotions. Instead of relying on a machine to do that for you.

There's other wrongs in that machine it's itself. It's use in the classroom would be only a one time use and never to be used again in some biology class. This still brings the case that it wouldn't be too much useful in classroom envirement. It would only fail and be compeletly useless.

By providing a user friendly experience that meets almost all the needs of the user, including making life a little bit easier, is what gives these devices the title ""smart."" Now, the next piece of tech to get this ""smart"" upgrade is the car. ""Smart"" cars have been in development for several years and appear to slowly becoming a reality. The usage of driverless cars has struck a gold mine of contraversy. But in all honesty, smart cars are the future for our roads. They will make our lives easier.

The introduction of smart cars on our roads today would result in a more efficent use of gasoline, a resource that is being exponentially depleated. From the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author says, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" By cutting the ammount of gasoline/fuel used on a day to day basses we could cut down on pollutants in our airs as well as prolong the life/usage of gasoline. Also the usage of smart cars, would be far cheaper than the usage of smart roads, a possibility once thought of by GM and engineers at Berkeley. Smart roads would require expensive upgrades to roads. With smart cars you could eliminate that hefty cost.

The technology used in ""beta smart"" cars today has been around since the 80's. It is not new technology. But at the same time it is not old technology because over the years the tech has decreased in price with a inversely proportional increase in it's new capabilities. With the ammount of tech used in smart cars it is important that it runs at the highest standards, and today's tech does. Only the best of the best is being used in these cars. Finally this new tech has not only been making driving a safer experience, but as a far more enjoyable one. With the introduction of new autonomous cars engineers have thought of new ways to make rides more enjoyable. New incar entertainment systems are just one of the many ideas that may become a reality.

Some people are afraid of smart cars. They fear that there will be no one to blame if an accident occurs. Plus some people may be uncomfortable with the idea of not being in control of their car.

Well today, smart cars are not 100% autonomous yet. For some instances such as traffic and construction driving require human driving and skill. Also other things such as backing in and out of places require human skill. Because in some cases human skill is still a requirement drivers must stay alert at all times. Eliminating any fear of not being in control as well as the problem of whom is to blame.

In conclusion, smart cars are the future. They will help eliminate the problem of inefficent use of gas while providing the driver with a smoother and more enjoyable ride. A full fletched smart car, is just and upgrade that is greatly needed.",4

Driverless cars aren't needed becuase these cars could cause conflict, technology isn't always dependable, and we already get into crash's now.

The main reason these cars aren't needed is because these cars could cause conflict. Driverless cars sound like a good idea but if you get into an accident because the manufacturer made a mistake, what would you do? In paragraph 9 of the section the author states, ""...new laws will be needed in order to cover liabilty in case of an accident."" This quote from the article shows how unsure the manufacturer is with his/ her product. If someone came up to you and said ""You can borrow my shampoo."" and then came later and said ""about my shampoo, I'm not sure if it'll clean your hair."" what would you say? You probably would be angry with them for telling you afterwards that it might not work. If someone isn't sure about a product that could possibly controll the fate of your life and gave it to you anyway, that's setting up an un-needed conflict.

Also, technology isn't always dependable, there could be many mishaps when technology is in control. In paragraph 9 of the article the author makes a point of why the driverless cars aren't needed, eventhough the author is clearly for them ""If the technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" This quote clearly shows how the technology isn't ready. Even if the manufacturer releases the vehicle he/she can't gurantee the technology will succeed. Would you want to have a driverless car that could patentially cause innnocent bistandards to be at risk.

Finally, why would you want to have a driverless car when we can't even controll the cars we have now? Almost everday on the news there is someone who gets in a car crash and gets injured whether it's a minor injury or a major one. in paragraph 8 the author tries to make a safety statement, ""...systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over..."" This quote tries to help you understand the safety of driverless cars but evidently it helped you realize another reason why they aren't needed. In the last paragraph you saw how the technology could patentially have a malfunction, what would happen if the heads up display stoppped working and and the driver didn't know he/she needed to take the will. That goes into yet another life threatening situation in which many people could be in danger.

In conclusion, driverless cars aren't needed because they could cause a lot of danger and conflict.                        ",4
fabc3b0,"First and formost, it is my belief that we should keep the electoral college because,it has been around for so many years so the question is why consider changing it now? The electoral college consists of 538 votes about 270 of electoral votes require them to elect a president too.

In 1976 a tie would have occured if a merge of 5,559 voters from ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii voted the other way so it is to my belief that we should keep the ectoral college and just let the popular vote idea be a thing of the past and move on. The benifit of having the electoral college is that it is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratie method of selecting a president that will handle his job and do what he is supposed to do.

Thirdly,both the electoral college and popular votes are good options but in my opinion i think the electoral college is better and the electoral college has five reason why they are the best.

Sometimes it's not even the lesson causing a student's disinterest or boredom.

And many childeren can have vastly different emotions based on not only being in school but about their day in general which have no application in the real world.

School curriculums are fine tuned to be the best tool for teacher and student, they allow for order and organization.

Allowing a computer to alter that, even slightly, can have devastating effects.

One computer doing so may not be an issue, but, allowing for every student's computer is another question entirely.

What is that question?

It is this: Could we still maintain order throughout that?

One little bug, one little glitch and a student could be so off track that his or her school wouldn't know what to do.

Keep the schools on track and organized.

Sometimes it isn't a lesson causing disinterest or confusion in a student.

Let's set up a hypothetical.

Joseph heard a dog barking outside, he tells his friends, they did not hear it.

Joseph is confused as to why they did not hear it.

Joseph's computer perceives Joseph's confusion as confusion towards his lesson and alters it accordingly only to confuse Joseph more as to why his lessons were changed.

It start a cycle that loops in on itself again and again.

Joseph understood his lessons and was now thrown wildly off track.

Proving that a computer making a decision based off of Joseph's emotions alone was massively ineffective.

Many students have vastly different opinions on learning and have many different emotions when going to school.

A computer sees the emotions but not the reasoning, whereas a human being can ask said student to understand him/her.

A computer cannot make sound judgement on a students emotions without knowing the reasoning behind such things.

It can perceive a students anger and relay it to the teacher but now the teacher must confront the student about why he is angry.

The student who is already upset will not want this interaction that the computer forced upon the two.

All in all people need to be left alone to allow for them to learn how to handle their emotions, and furthermore they deserve the privacy of having said emotions to themselves.

In conclusion, information on a student's emotions is

not valuable in the least, and allowing a computer to make judgement off of said emotions is ineffective and much too risky.

Teaching students should be mainstream and not alterred to fit the student's emotional state.

As with the case with Joseph, a computer would not understand that Joseph is not confused with his lesson and then cause more confusion instead of aiding it.

And finally, students have too vast of emotions for one computer program to accurately interpret and furthermore human beings deserve the privact of their own emotions.",4
3ef2980,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author has suggeted to study Venus a worthy pirsuit despiting the dnagers it presents. Venus is the second planet from the Sun . Venus is a bright star in the night sky , we can see Venus from dis but is very challenging to see up close . Venus is the closest planet to Earth referring to size and density . At time we are closer to Mars and sometimes we are closer to Venus . In this essay I will be talking about all the dangers to study Venus and sending humans to go study Venus .

We all may think Venus is a beautfiul planet , there is nothing wrong with Venus , why can't we just land on Venus and study it ? Well , we were all wrong Venus is one of the most dangerous planet to land on . Venus is covered with almost 97% of carbon dioxide , which makes it challening to see because of all the clouds of sulfuric acid . In paragraph 3 it states ""On the planet's surface, temperatures avergae over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This quote is staing how dangerous Venus can be . It also states ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and

would liquefy many metals."" As I have been saying Venus is too dabgerous to go study but the author believes we should anyway . As the author suggest that studying Venus , here is why and how we should study Venus . NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus . In paragraph 5 it states ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" Humans can survive studying Venus using the propers ways to prevent anyone from dying. In the paragraph it states ""temperatures would be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit , but the air pressure would be close to of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful , and radiation would not exceed earth levels . Not easy conditions , but survivabal for humans."" This quote is stating that we can be able to survive those type of conditions . Therfore , we can be able to study Venus by sneidng humans , despite the dangers Venus presents.

As we can see anything is possible , even if Venus has some very dangerous conditions . Throughout this essay , the author suggests studying Venus worthy because for one humans , people would like to know what Venus is like . Many researchers are trying their best to land or hover over Venus despite the dangers . Overall , this essay is like a challenge to see if any human can survive and get any information of Venus .                   ",4

i

will talk about the challenge of exploring venus and whats the importance about this article.

venus is sometimes called evening star and is actually a planet

is the second planet from our sun and is closest in distance to he earth and he author said that venus is a challenge for humans and said that for some reason no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.

on the venus surface temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet and these conditions are extreme for the humans venus includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters like the earth for this facts venus is a important reason to the humans study the planet and also have not easy conditions , but survivable for humans and another proyect about this is looking back to an technology called mechanical computer.

i think that this article is so intersting because the author explain some important fact about the venus planet and i think that is a good investigation from the venus palnet. ",2
aae7267,"Can you really trust a car to take you from point A to point B safely? There are many possible things that can go wrong while a person is not controlling their car. I think that there is not a safe way for a car to drive a person all by itself. If you don't know the next action that your car is going to take, how can you stop anything bad from happening? Will the car be able to determine where to stop if it is approaching a stop sign? There are too many ""what ifs"" with a driverless car for me to feel safe to ride in one, or to even have one driving on the street around me.

To me, there are a variety of things that can go wrong when you are allowing the car drive all by itself. There are too many questions that need to be answerd about these new cars. For example, how will the car react to a sudden change in the environment? If another car gets to close will it swerve out of the way potentionally causing an accident? Even if the car notifies the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, what will happen if the driver isn't notified in time? Also, if one of the sensors on the car were to be broken or damaged, then how could the car continue to drive on its own? Would it notify the driver that a new part is needed? If the car were to get into an accident, who would be to blame, the driver or the company that created the car? Would it depend if it was on manual control or automatic? These questions are the main reasons why the driverless cars need to be improved before I will even think about ridding in one. I know that I would rather know exactly what I am doing and how it will be done instead of having a car try to do it for me.

I think that driverless cars are a terrible idea. There are too many problems that can occur during the driving process, and I don't want my life in the hands of a car that can't see or think the way that a human does. If during some parts of the drive it requires a human to take the wheel, why have it automatically drive you? Wouldn't it get tiring waiting for your turn to drive, especially when you aren't sure when the car is going to have you take over? You must stay focused on the road and have both hands on the wheel, so you could very easliy just drive the car yourself without the worry. This way you can control the situations that you get into, and not having a car get you into trouble that you might not be able to get out of. I think that it is much more safe to have a human that can respond quickly to change and can manuver through obsticals than to have a car, that might not see everything in its environment, drive automatically through it.

The author uses facts that does not fit his opinion on why we should try to put a man on Venus. He actually uses more reason why we should not put a man on Venus. The author uses the other side of the arguements evidence that he is against as evidence which he should not do. "" Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades"" (paragraph 2). This shows how the author was saying reasons why we should not try to get a man on venus.

The author may have had a few evidence for his side of the arguement, but he used more of the other side which will make people think the other way than what the author really wants you to think. The author could not support his arguement all the way because he tried to use the evidence on the other side of the arguement.                    ",2

The first way it would be valuable for the students in the classroom by telling how the students are feeling. When we look at our friends face we can tell if they are sad, mad, happy etc. With the new technology it can tell use what emotiones they are really happening. For example the author states"" the software can identify mixed emotiones."" The technology can tell us if we should go talk to them, leave them alone and try to give them advice. This is one way how the technology would be valuable in the students in the classroom.

The second way it would be valuable students of the classroom by it can tell if students need help. When teachers teach they don't know if students are getting the lesson. With the new technology a classroom computer could send an alert if the student not getting the lesson. For example the author states"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This well help teachers if they need to change there plans for the lesson or say it in a different way so the student won't be confused. This is the second way the technology could be valuable because help teachers know if students getting the information down.

The last way the new technology would be valuable for students in the classroom is by seeing if someone likes a certain ad on the computer. In the article the author states "" when a ad pop's up and you smile it could send similar ads but when you frown it send a different one."" So when a video game ad pop up the student good like that ad and go to website. This well help because the computer well know certains ads you like and dislike. This is the last way the technology can be valuable for students in the classroom because the computer well recognize what ads student like.

This are three ways the technology could be valuable to students in the classroom because it could tell how students are feeling, how students could be help and what ads do students like.",3
4eed225,"Although many people see various advantages in creating and having driverless cars, I do not agree with, or support the production of these vehicles. There are many reasons why I don't agree with, or support the production of these vehicles. Who in their right mind would ever want to be sitting in an operating vehicle with no driver behind the wheel? Safety is always first, no matter what the circumstance. Many people would beg to differ, but in my mind, this idea just doesn't make any sense to me.

The article states that ""people have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" In my opion, I don't see how we, as the people of our country, ""have"" to do anything. While Dr. Werner Huber stated this, there is a new question that comes to my mind. Why should we, again as the people of our country"", consider on having any kind of ""fun"" with the production of these vehicles. I think, if anything, we should consider being extremely careful with our thinking process when it comes to the production of these vehicles.

To me, when I think of a ""driverless car"", the thoughts that come to my mind right away, aren't exactly safe thoughts. I believe very firmly that, even if the production of these vehicles actually occurs, we should all take into consideration the many different safety hazzards that would potentially come with the production of these vehicles. If I had kids that were of legal to drive, I sure as heck would never let them even get in a car that didn't have a human being behind the wheel. I think that the idea of ""driverless cars"", is one that needs to be rethought. In my head, if the idea is logical, then the idea will surely work.

Overall, I don't agree with the idea of producing ""driverless cars"". As the text states, most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. In my opinion, I would like to keep it that way. In order for our future to grow in the automotive industry, we need to be coming up with better ideas than this. Although many people would say that this idea is ""fun"", I am not for it.             ",3
bacd8f3,"In this article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is about how the author describes new technology called the Facial Action Coding System which identifys the human emotions. This technology shouldn't read the students' facial expression. It shouln't read a students facial expressions because first off there's no reason to do it at a school especially. Second of all there's more other emotions than happiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness to tell of your face or mood. And the last reason is there's other new technology that can copy the 3-D face plus it could be dangerous.

First off, there's no reason to do it in a school. Mainly because at a school you learn about different subjects like math, english, science, etc. I do not think this is some ""lab experiment"" either. Although the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face, and has all the 44 major muscles in the model to move like the human muscles. Do we really need all that just to tell what your facial expression is saying.

Second of all there's other emotions than happiness,surprised, anger, fear, and sadness. Also there is lots of names on your face of what shows the emotion you are in. Orbicularis oris tightens your lip which shows anger, the zygomatic major lifts up the corner of your mouths,oculi pars palpabraeus make the crow feet, the zygomatic major is having your mouth stretched sideways while the risorius is a different muscle. According to the article you have to make those ""fake smile"" that has all those to test your facial expression.

The last reason is because there's new studies that basically copies your facial expression or movents to a thing on the IPhone X called the Animoji. Animoji is basically an emoji coming to life and it can talk, copy your facial expression , and if you move your head around it'll move it's head around. Plus it's also a 3-D model as well. If the Animoji see's that your eyebrows are up or down, the corner of your mouth is lifted, or that your eyes are squinted it will copy every movement. Its dangerous beacuse apparently once it captures your face, basically the government or polices will know where to find you or how you look like all because of that.

Those are my reasons why this technology should not be used on students is because first off there is no reason to do it at a school, second of all there's other facial expressions other than happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and my last reason is because there's new studies and it could be dangerous fo student.

256de7d,"With the advancement in technology in our society the need for cars has become are very big necessity. But recently in Freiburg, Germany they do they have stopped the use of cars and many don't even own them. A woman by the name heidrun Walter said ""I'm much happier this way, I used to be a lot more tense when i had a car"". Currently, not having cars have helped the community be a better place, many ride bicycles places and you can hear the sound of children playing in the streets ""drowning out the sound of distant motors."" More recently however planners for this organization are trying to make their way towards the suburbs. The reason they are working to make a car free nation is because recently Passenger cars are the reason for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and it even goes up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the U.S!

The U.S Environmental Protection Agency promotes ""car reduced"" communities, even legislators are starting to act. With the decrease of cars it would bring many benefits, You would have less deaths from drunk driving or driving in general, It would be safer for your children to play in the streets, pollution would go down to a low, the chances of rode rage would go to a very low, and no cars would also mean many stores would be built closer to homes so its in walking distance. Also we would most likely have more public transport so the need for cars wouldn't be needed.

Another place that is working their way into being car free is BOGOTA, Colombia; Recently they had a specific day where millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work because it was a car free day. Violators faced $25 fines if they went against it. Even with rain people have still participated, people know that they are making the community a better place one car less at a time. It has also been a good opportunity to lower stress and air pollution in our environment. For the first time two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar also joined the event. Even Municipal authorities from other countries came with enthusiasm to see this event. One of them by the name Enrique Riera stated ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" This campaign had started in the mid-1990s and has since cause the construction of 118 bike paths according to the city mayor. Also parks and sports centers have become a bigger thing and have been built all throughout the city. uneven sidewalks have been replaced with fresh neat side walks, rush hours restrictions have cut traffic, and new shopping and restaurants of started to show.

Recently in Paris After days of near record pollution, Paris had to ban all driving because the smog was just way too bad. It was so bad that they would fine you $31 if you got caught leaving the house with a car. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and Twenty-seven had their cars impounded for their reaction. Cold nights and warm days are the main cause of the car trap emmisions. Diesel fuel was also blamed since France has a tax policy that put diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in france, Compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of West Europe.              ",3

If there was any form of a living species you would have at least seen Egyptian- style pyramids or even small shacks.

Mars is a planet that is know for having rocks on it, there is a possibility that this is just a huge rock that was carved into the planet already or the planet it's self got either hit by and astroid or had been forming it's self in some way. Aliens could'nt have build the face they would've needed soem short of unground passege or even shelter's, none of these things were found when we discoverd the face. We get the picture looks blurry btu even with zooming in you can't see any such thing as if there was an alien.

Scientist has studied the photos the astronots had brought home we saw their were may rocks this could have been a mistake. How would an alien know what a human face looks like anyways? By our understand we could be looking at it and imageing it's a face when really it's just a rock that was formed to look like a humans head.

April 5, 1998 when mars Global Surveyor flew oven the face he snapped pictures ten times sharper then the original Viking photos. Thousands of people anxious to have the photo appear on JPL web site by yet still came out with saying that it was just an natural landform. People were not satisfied, this bring's me back to the point were it was just our imagination maybe we're lookingat it wrong it's really meant to look like one thing but were making it look like another.

We belive that if aliens really did make this face how come their wasn't any type of form in which we can tell their was any type of life form living on mars? Landscapes are usual to see on planest and this was one of them. If there was any type of life form i think Michale Malin would have already taken pictures of them if he had seen anything.

790e742,"A lot of arguments can be made after reading the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"". It is actually a very interesting article to read.

A lot of people would actually like the idea of having self driving cars.

Me on the oher hand, not so much.

I completely disagree with the idea of having driverless cars on our roads.

Having self driving cars seem cool as it is, but they can pose many dangerious threats and safety concerns.

First, there's always the possibility of the cars malfunctioning at one point.

The article says that the cars can accelerate and brake by themselves, but what if that didn't happen because something with the car went wrong?

It can put

civilians lives in danger if that were to happen.

Secondly, when the driver is waiting for his or her turn to take control of the car, they could really get bored and lose focus on the road.

So when the car alerts the driver to take control of the car when the driver isn't paying attention, it could lead to a minor or severe accident.

I know the article said they can put on some sort of entertainment to make sure the driver doesn't become bored, but there's still a possibility of that malfunctioning as well.

In conclusion, I really disagree with the idea of having driverless cars.

The idea may seem to captivate many peoples interest, but there are too many risks that come with this idea.

So to limit the amount of future possible accidents, I would say it's best for our safety to just leave cars the way they are now.        ",3
08c6a31,"Using the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in a classroom. Many students often get bored, distracted, or just lose focus when being taught a lesson that doesn't interest them. Of course you can't just not learn the lesson, since you are learning because it will come to use later on. Therefore, I believe that with help from your computer screen, you could stay on track with your work.

Often times, teachers use different teaching styles based on what allows their students to learn most effectively. With the Facial Action Coding System, computers could do so, too. For example, say you're reading an excerpt on the computer and it's not really on a topic that interests you, most students would immediately lose attentiveness to the reading. This is not a good thing, especially if the information was important, useful, or for a grade. But, with the Facial Action Coding System, this problem could be solved. The system could be used to spice up the learning, or keep the teaching style stays the same way if the student is staying attentive.

Many people learn in a different way. Some students are more effectively taught by learning visually, others hands-on, and some verbally. The Facial Action Coding system could recognize these based on students facial expressions. If the student is looking focused while seeing a diagram, the system could see they're a visual learner, and keep teaching the topic in that way. Otherwise if that doesn't work, the system could see if the student's emotions would change based on if they could listen to the information instead of reading.

Based on the positive characteristics of the Facial Action Coding System, I believe we should have the technology at school. The system could really be put to use, especially if it could help students learn and understand topics in an easier way. The emotion reading technology would be extremely valuable to have in a classroom.   ",4
00dd003,"Using the Facial Action Coding System is not necessary whatsoever. This will just be taking up space in already crowded schools, and having schools waste money on a emotion coding system.

These Facial Action Coding Systems will be even more of a distraction. Phones are already enough of a distraction this will be even worse. Kids will just make face expressions to find out what emotion a certain face tells. ""Empathy (feeling somone else's emotional state..."" Most kids like to just have their space and not be bothered. This is also spending money on things that are not mandantory so money will just be wasted. At the end of the day like who is really interested in what a face expression tells about you?

This computer can be a problem too some kids. Other kids knowing about their emotions they can be bullied and mistreated for how they feel. Every ""positive"" always has a negative. This can bring hatred upon someone a kid who is always sad and has hatred can be bullied and make the kid even more depressed. ""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" This Facial Coding system can ruin some kids this is not for everyone, your emotions are not for everyone.

Why is determining what your facial expression says about you instead of learning? Why are we not focused on teaching out kids great education and personal finance? We are so caught up in technology our kids are getting distracted and in trouble over it. The Facial Action Coding System doesn't belong in schools and shouldn't be allowed too. ",2
b7ee6a4,"Living in a community without the use of cars can be extremely beneficial. It might seem odd to say such an idea because we have lived in towns with alot of car usage all of our lives. Heidrun Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Not having a car can be very stressless. This is because you do not have to worry about wrecking your car, keeping up with the insurance payments, talking care of it (such as oil changes) and eventually, having to buy a new one which can be very expensive.

Another reason why not having a car is beneficial is that it can help the enviornment. Right now, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This number keeps on climbing because more and more people are buying cars which just puts more gas into the enviornment.

An even greater benefit of living in a community without cars is that you can get more excercise. Sitting in the car everyday going to and from work for 2 hours is not being productive. However, in the existing car-free communities, all the necessary store are in walking or biking distance from the majority of the population. So, the commute to work for most people can be just like getting a daily exercise and staying in shape.

In conclusion, I firmly beleive that living in a community without cars would be a change for the better. It would help with everyones finanical situations and everyone would have better health because you would have to bike and walk everywhere. As of lately, it has seemed like less and less people have started to use cars. The number of miles drivn peaked in 2005 and has been dropping since.

4fe1805,"My point on driverless cars, I would not like to see them on the road because they can cause accidents or injuries/death. Also, they can cause serious complications on someone's life if they were injured by the driverless car.

They don't have the quick response like humans do when they drive, plus if they are on the road when its slick and they don't know to be slow when on slick roads they can cause accidents. The question would be if the driverless cars were to get into an accident, whose fault would it be? If the human driver didn't cause it should the company get fault for it and even get sued? Or should the human driver take the blame since they are human and actually driving a car. The company who manufactured the car should take full responsibily with the accident. The driverless cars could malfunction and cause a serious or life-threatening car crash to the human driver on the other side of the rucus. Many people don't want driverless cars on the road so people won't get hurt first off, and secondly they don't want them on the road so they won't mess up and cause harm. Although the driverless cars have humans on standby, they still shouldn't be made because of all the safety hazards it could cause on the other people and the technology that was built into the car, its essentially a waste of money to make a car thats driverless and it gets wrecked beyond repair. With the laws that could be put into place if driverless cars become a thing of the 21st century, they can and will blame the company who made the car for it either malfunctioning or the human in the car not realizing there was iminate danger ahead. They wouldn't blame the person who was on the other side of the wreck because he knew what he was doing, the driverless car wouldn't know what it was doing. If that were to happen driverless cars would be illegal in all states not just in California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia.

In conclusion I think cars that are driverless should not be allowed to be a thing because of all the safety hazards and the complications it could cause. Also, they shouldn't be allowed because they can cause accidents that could be minor or life-threatening.",3
2177ad2,"There are many benifits of limiting how many times you use your car some are.  Not driving a car can make you less stressed out in life.  Not driving a car can lower pollution in the air dramatically.  Lastly cars arnt as needed as before.  so not driving a car can actully be good for you in the long run.

First of all not driving a car can make you less stressed out in life.""when I had a car I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way""(elisabeth roseenthal) by saying this she means that without a car to worry about it has made he less stressed out and much happier as a person.  ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress said businessman carlos arturo plaza""(andrew selsky) in this article this man says it a good chance to take away stess about worrying about a car, the bills for it, insurance on the car or anything else in that matter.

Second of all not driving a car can help to lower the air pollution around you.  according ro one acrticle they stopped driving an estimate of four thousand cars and has dramaticcaly lowered the amount of smog(greenhouse gas) in there towns air.  so if you stop driving cars it will help to lower the amount of smog in the air of your city or in the community around you.  ""The smog cleared enough monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"" in this article one city gave up driving lots of there cars for a while and doing so lowed the amount of smog in the air.

Third of all driving a car is really not needed for many things.  Why drive when you could just walk or ride a bike to where you are going there is really no point in you driving a car now and then.  Not driving but walking also opens more doors for buissness to be put in next to side walks or just in walking distance of your house.

So there are many good things that can come from not driving a car and those things are.  Not driving a car can make you less stressed out.  Not driving can lower the pollution in the air by alot. and finally driving is not intirelly needed for situiation.     ",3
c31ef3b,"Mars has been a planet that we have been exploring for many years. We have discovered many abnormal objects on the planet. In 1976, we took a picture of the region Cydonia, and we found something that seemed to look like a human face. Our eyes are adapted to recognizing faces and that is why we recognized the face on Mars more easily. Higher quality images that were taken in 2001 show that the face on Mars is no sign of ancient civilization on Mars but in fact a mesa. It is a natural landform just like it would be on our home planet of Earth. Although some conspiracy theorists say differently, and think that is some sort of ancient civilization building these objects.

First off, the cameras that we have today are more advanced than the ones we had. The first picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken in 1976 and the quality back then was not as good as it is now. The picture that was taken in 2001 was a higher quality picture and scientists figured out that is was just a mesa and not a sign of any ancient civilization on Mars. For example the camera used in 1976, spanned 43 meters compared to the camera NASA used in 2001 spanned 1.56 meters. In the picture of 1976, the shadows that were present that day formed an illusion that made it seem like there was a face. In paragraph two of the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says that, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

Another thing is that, Jim Garvin, a cheif scientist from NASA's Mars Exploration Program, compared the Martian mesa to natural landforms that occur here on Earth. In paragraph 12, Garvin said, "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about thye sane height as the Face on Mars."" Jim Garvin is saying that these formations on Mars are very similar to the ones that we have here on Earth. He is also saying that there os no face on Mars.

In contrast, conspiracy theorists say that there is a face on Mars and that there is ancient civilization on Mars. In paragraph 8, it says that, "" The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings we hidden by haze."" Conspiracy theorists also state that NASA would rather hide the evidence that there is an ancient civilization on Mars, as it says in paragraph 5. Also stated in paragraph 5, is that the defenders of NASA wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

The face has been a pop icon ever since the discovery of the formation. the face will always be a piece of history and will always been known to man. If there was an actual face on Mars then that would be a sign of life. The face ended up eing a mesa and nothing else besides that. Although it would have been an exciting discovery for NASA, we still have much more of space that is unknown and unexplored. NASA is bound to find some kind of incredible object. We will have to wait until that day comes and find something incredible and will be part of the incredible true story of space.                             ",5
1468510,"Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe have worked on a software that can detect how a person is feeling. The software is called teh FAcial Action Coding System, or FACS. The software can use muscle detectors to analyze and detect how a person is feeling. From my perspective, I think this is a great software to have, especially for certain situations. Some situations may include popping up media.

One reason why I think this is a great idea is because of it's function where it recognizes what you're feeling, and make modifications based around it, so you'll feel better. In the text, it mentions of how the software can detect whether someone is confused or bored, and can make some modifications to better suit the person. This shows that when it does that, it can help students better understand the topic. In the text, it mentions how when the software detects your emotion, it sends over an ad based on how you feel. This shows that if someone is feeling sad, they can send them an article about how to get better or how to overcome a loss, which is really useful. This is great for using media to assist you, but of course, it has a human-caused benefit.

The software can help you make random faces, and when done, it can help you with your emotions. In the text, it states that making fake smiley faces actually causes you to feel slightly happy. This shows that when you're making a fake smiley face when down, there's a chemical in your body that actually can help you get better. In the text, it states that Stanislavsky has his students make happy faces and frowning faces, due to the previous fact to help them better act. This shows that the software can help you detect whether or not you're actually acting a feeling well or not. Now, there is a benefit for those who don't have a software.

The software can detect facial muscles, and that helps it point out what a person is feeling. In the text, it states that the software succesfully recognized Mona Lisa's facial muscles, and it showed her to be 83% happy. This shows that the software can go through many paintings and easily detect how they're feeling. In the text, it states that with it's muscle-detecting technology, it can detect whether or now a politician or celebrity is being truthful or not. This shows that the software can detect whether or not a celebrity is lying, and that can helpful, especially in an allegation.

Overall, I believe that this technology is good to have around. It can detect how you feel, and attempt to assist you. It can cause you to make fake happy faces and actually feel happy. Finally, it can help out with detecting a truthful person or not. With that said, I believe that this will go great with classrooms in the country. ",4
e63006a,"25 years ago, there was an abnormal structure discovered by NASA's Viking 1 Space Shuttle as it was circling Mars to find possible landing sites for it's siter ship Viking 2 when it spotted the abnormal structure. This abnormal sturcture was called the ""Face on Mars"" that stretched out two miles from end to end located in Cydonia. Shortly after it was found, scientists figured it was just another Martian Mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

In 1976, the first pictures of the ""Face on Mars"" was taken by NASA's Viking 1, but a few days later NASA unveiled the image for the world to see and told people it was just a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" As of May 24, 2001, NASA revealed ""the Face on Mars"" is just a mesa. As the pictures were reveiled on the JPL web site ""the Face on Mars"" was just a natural landform and that there was no alien monument after all. On April 8, 2001, Mallin's team captured a photo using the camera's absolute maximum resoltuion, each pixel in the 2001 photograph spans 1.56 meters compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best Viking 1 photo in 1976. ""If there was an object in this photograph like planes on the ground of Eygptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"", said Garvin.

In conclusion, ""the Face on Mars"" is not real for it it just a natural landform on the Red Planet. ""In the picture it actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common arounf the American West."" says Garvin. Many people believed that this photo was created by aliens but we have pictures and space shuttles out there to prove ""the Face on Mars"" is just a landform on the Red Planet.",2
6d41232,"There are many advantages when it comes to limiting car usage. These advantages aren't just for the environment's safety, but your safety as well. These advantages include less problems with our environment, and with our society.

When it comes to greenhouse gasses, remember that there is carbon monoxide, which is a greenhouse gas, coming out from the tailpipe of the cars. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, they make up to 50 percent of greenhouse gasses that polute. It is important to reduce the amount of gasses that enter the air through cars, so limiting car usage would help to limit the amount of gasses that have entered the atmosphere.

Another problem that is issued with car usage is traffic safety. There have been many car accidents and crashes in the United States, as well as many other areas in the world. It would be safer if people walked, biked, hiked, skated, or even took buses to places that they would need to go. Limiting car usage would also greatly reduce the number of accidents. It would also lower stress as well for people who are easily tense and stressed. If you are riding a bike or walking, you don't necessarily want to hear the sound of motors and engines. If they limit the amount of car usage, there would be less tension and more relaxation to those who would chose not to use a car. Also, riding bikes, walking, skating, or hiking can be a great workout for outdoorsmen who want to do something active, instead of sitting in the car getting from point A to point B.

Limiting the number of cars, or the ammount of times that we spend in our vehicles daily would cause great improvements in the economy and society. This could help preserve the environment and the safety of people as well. It all comes down to less car usage and spending more time walking, or even doing excercise.    ",3
f203f9e,"Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too!!!!

In paragraph 5 the arthor includes that NASA has particularay complelling idea for sending human to study venus.

In paragraphn 8 the arthor says striving to meet the challenege presented by venus has value, ot only beacuse if the insight to be gainied on the planet itself.

In paragraph 8 the arthor also says our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

As the arthor metion earlier in paragaraph 2 about earth's previous misson was unmanned,and for good reasons, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, mabety this is the issue that explains why not a single spacweship has touched down to venus in more than 3 decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.

Even more challening are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atomsphere. On the planet venus the surface, temeeratures average over 800 degress fahrenheit, and the atmosheric pressuire in 90 times greater than what we expreienec on our own planet.

1493f33,"The face on mars that you guys keep hearing about is not in fact a piece of landscape made by aliens. It is a just a form of land like we have; moutains,rivers, pyramids and stuff like that.Just because it's on a different planet doesn't mean it was made by aliens. Do you think the moutains, rivers, and pyramids on earth were made by aliens? Well I did some research on some on this stuff and I looked in a artical called ""Unmasking the Face of Mars."" The text said,"" Scientist figured it was another Martain mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh."" What that information was telling me is that the the pictures they took made it look like a Egyptian pharoh something that's on earth, a shape or some what, so if the planet has wind blowing on it like on our world then the sand on the planet can make a shape of anything. I also was reading in this artical and I saw that it said,"" There was no alien monument after all.""What does that tell you and if you don't believe me I got another explination.

In the artical I was reading the text also states that,"" It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. "" That's a lava dome that takes the formor an islolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars"". I that information quality enough for you. I mean we have volcanos the same size as that form rock. Even though I got some of this information from an artical dosen't mean it's not true even though you guys got that false information from an artical your selves. I know it's the truth because if their were Martains who did this don't you think we would have saw traces of someone building it like hammers and ladders ect. If you really look at the photo it just looks like craiters and sink holes making the shape of a face.I know you played in the sand before and you know that it can just slide through or fall and move by its self.

c68cdfd,"Why should technology be able to read emotional expressions? Some people probaley thing it's a good thing others probley don't. With the technology we have today they have been able to figure out how to read emotions on the computer. It's a bad thing because people should be able to open up to you, they shouldn't be afraid that they feel a way that they didn't want you to know, and it's not right.

People should be able to open up without a computer telling them how they feel. According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", ""According to the facial Feedback Theory of Emooion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" In this quote it shows that it can read your emotions but that some people can't open up, but ones that can might be hiding something. But what if they didn't want them to know and that computer just told them.

Also, people shouldn't be afraid to open us but with the computes they might be afraid to open up. According to the article,""Eckman has classified six bacis emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristics movements of the facial muscles."" In this guote it shows that The computer can tell those emotions but if someone is afraid to show they are sad but the computer can tell you are faking. Then you will have to open up but what is you don't feel safe and that's why you haven't opened up.

Finally, the computers reading your emotions making you open up even if you didn't want to is not right. Yes, if the computer can tell your sad and upset about something and you are not okay that could save you life but you are scared. According to this article, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" A friend will open up to you don't need a computer to tell you how you feel. What happens if the computer is wrong? Then your family and friend might think you are sad but you really aren't then what happens. The computer can be wrong not everyone is the same.

It's a bad thing because people should be able to open up to you, they shouldn't be afraid that they feel a way that they didn't want you to know, and it's not right. People don't need a compute to tell people the way they feel and their family. You might not feel safe to open up to a family member but the computer tells them then they know.

7a95534,"Technology is a semi-new thing, therefore using it to benifit peoples learning is a major aspect of technology. Technology is used for entertainment, and creating ways of excitment in people. However technology is also used as a weapon in negative ways, like look at the internet for example; this form of technology is used for positive reasons and negative reason. However when used in positive ways the internet is and can be used a an amzing source of positivity and a benifital tool to those who use it.

Classrooms in america are getting more strict and incressing in difficulty mainly, due to the amount of difficulty it takes to master areas in which people want to succeed; like the job field for example now days jobs are harder to access therefore schools are tying to give their students an upper hand in this field.

Monotorying has always been a thing ever since it was possible, there are positive and negative sides to this phenominon. There are companies who use monotring as a negative thing; like say spying on an employs dailey activities besides work, however companies can use this form of monoturing on checking to see if there is something a employey has problems with a spesific thing at a job site.

Overall I think that technology along with it negative aspects can be a positive tool twards benifiting peoples lives, just like educuation. Educational staff are only seeking healty lives and suitiable jobs for those they teach and support. So therefor teachers and staff using technology is postitive ways can be a benifical tool.

Emotion tracking technology is a new advancement that could weave into a new direction and form of how our schooling sysetem works. this could be a very good thing for us a society as a whole. I personally thing that is a great idea for students that have near given up on schooling and the system itself.

Technology is used for entertainment, and greative ways of exciting people. Therefore in conclusion i do belive that using positive forms of technology to help further students learning and productivity is a major step in the right direction. Collages nowadays are only accepting students that are determinded and not afriad to go that extra step for themselves and others, and if teachers use a form of technology can futher those skills, then this can be a very good topic of disscusstion. In conclusion i would like to see a new and improved form of technology that will help teachers and staff get the knowledge to kids and young adults in need for a better life than say not having the new and impoved technological advances we have as a society now.

9f55388,"Driverless cars could be one of the best inventions in the world if they worked 100% of the time and did not need any help from a human. For now though they are still a very useful invention. There are many reasons why they would and will be in the future. Some of the reasons are, reduced human errors, reduced accidents, and less fuel usage.

If driverless cars became fully automated to the point that a driver does not even have to do anything; is when human errors connected to driving will be close to eliminated. Humans may interfear with the car every so often and cause it to do something unintended, but for the most sake it would have no errors. Being able to drive without ever having crashes would be awesome. For one there would never need to be arguements about who hit who or money down the drain because of one stupid mistake. It would help people save money if they had a car that never crashed because there was no error. It could possible help the economy if people did not ever have to put money towards fixing their car after a crash. It could also reduce the amounts of death and injury from car crashes. Which would also reduce their money spent on hospital bills and inshurance. Driverless cars could be helpful in many ways, and reducing human error could help save people money and injury.

Accidents are very bad no matter how it happens. One way accidents should not happen is car crashes. If everyone followed the rules of the road, there would be no car crashes, but not everyone follows those rules. If there was driverless cars there would be no accidents, because every car would follow the rules of the road. Cars do not text and drive last time I checked. They also do not drink and drive, call and drive, or eat and drive. They do one job only, drive. We think phone calls or responding to texts is urgent no matter the time. Well, we are wrong, I would rather keep my life rather than risk it for a text or phone call, and the same goes for drinking and driving. I would rather take a cab home than risk drinking and driving, not only because it is illeagal, but because it is also dangerous. Your life is the most important thing in the world, and a driverless car can help you savor that. For no one wants to die a death that could have been avoided.

Less fuel usage in cars would be amazing. One reason is no one likes to spend extra money if they do not have to. Lower cost is something we can all agree on. Also it would reduce our usage on the oil we are using up. If the driverless cars would reduce the fuel usage it could help us savor what we have less of, because at some point it will be gone, and when it does we need a backup plan. If we could cut our fuel usage in half right now, it could give us some time to think of something else to fall back on when we get close to losing all of our resources. Driverless cars could be the first step towards that goal.

Driverless cars could have a huge impact on the world we live in today. From saving lives to saving money to saving our resources, driverless cars are expected to help the world a lot. They will be able to help people that are careless today, which could end up savning a life down the road. Driverless cars will be a new start to a new beginning.",4

First of all, the seagoing cowboys help people in different countries. Some people think they are just sending supplies over seas. However, the cowboys along with shipping supplies and food and animals go along with the shipment. Seagoing Cowboys also headed for Greece with a 335 horses in the cargoalong with food to feed all the horses. I think this would be an excellent job to participate in.

Secondly, the cowboys visit unique places. Some people think on jobs like this you won't see anything. But, the seagoing cowboys have seen parts of Europe and China. A seacowboy named Luke has even toured a excuvated castle in Crete and marvled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. I infer that a lot of people see a lot of different places.

Lastly, it's a great opportunity. People may think it's just another job and a waste of time. But, it opens up the world to people who never seen the world before. It even makes people more aware of people in different countries. I beleive that becoming a seagoing cowboy would be great for people to see what is going on in the world.

You have to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Pretty much anyone can join too! Luke Bomberger was working at a grocery store and a bank in the normal city, then the next thing you know, hes in a different country exploring. Its a big change to go through. It feels good to help out innocent animals in need. Although the trips to and from the sea can be dangerous, its very worth it to go join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Its kind of like being a cowboy and a pirate.

It is such a wonderful expierience to do this program. Its not something you can do everyday, its like being an NBA player, you cant just say you are one. You have to work for these things, only the greatest people get the opportunity to become great. Luke Bomberger was special, so thats why he qualified for the program.

Therapist could use this machine to see what their patients emotions are and it would help the patient open up to the therapist because the therapist knows exactly how the client is feeling.This machine would also be useful in school because the teachers and the counclers could see what each student is feeling and itr would hep the kids who have bad lives at home actually open up and let the school personel know about it and they could get to the bottom of it.

The Facs machine would be an awsome invention to have because it does no harm what so ever and you can use it for good reason to get people who are hard to have a conversation with open up, Therapist and schools could use this machine to make sure everyones mental health is allright and people are not being depressed.

The Facial Action Coding System would be a great thing to have in school because some kids are shy an dont like to talk and raise there hands in class infront of everyone and if you dont ask questions when you dont understand something that could cause you to fail the class all because of your shyness.

Yes , the Facial Action Coding System is needed for schools and worth spending some money on for schools all over the world but them again we wouldnt need to invest in this if students spoke up about what they needed and whats going on but some students jus have a sad or mad face everyday for no reason so the Facial Action Coding Syestem may read their facial expressionand say that student is mad , when the student is just doing there normal face . The school board or government shoudnt have to invest in the Facial Action Coding System if teachers take the time and talk to their students some teachers are the reason the students become mad beause they make the students mad when they have to do too much homework or even class work , it also is a better way for humans to connect with the computers as it says that in paragraph 1.

To sum it all up this technology could come in handy in certain situations , the teachers might like it but the students might not , your boss may like it but you probably wouldnt . Its a win win situation for students it would tell others how your feeling and if you sad someone might talk to you to let you know your not alone , and for teachers its benificial because it could help you understand your students more.

badadc1,"Driverless cars may be coming in our future, but they most likely will not be commonly used. Driving a car run by a computer allows a number of problems to occur. Since 2009, driverless cars have been around. These cars are only considered driverless under certain conditions though. If the car is not reliable in all traffic conditions, people should not rely on them to get them where they need to go safely.

Society today relies on technology and computers for almost everything from talking to friends to sending military signals hundreds of miles. At times, even the most advanced technology glitches. Driving a car that is controlled by technology would pose the same problems. Would the car still drive if it started raining? What would happen if the rotating sensor on the roof glithched? A driver, assuming the car is driving, may not be attentive and see the signal given by the car for the human to take over. The car could crash causing even bigger problems than just faulty technology.

Crashes occur even when human drivers are in control of the car. It is inevitable that crashes are likely to happen in the autonomous cars as well. Paragraph 9 states that, ""in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" If these driverless cars are better than having a human behind the wheel, most states would allow them to be tested. Even if they were tested and allowed to be driven new laws would have to be put into place. In the case of an accident, would drivers or manufacturers be at fault for the accident? Drivers might claim that they did not see the signs that the car gave them signifying that the human was supposed to take over. Manufacturers would argue saying that the driver was unattentive to their surroundings.

Drivers who rely on computer driven cars may loose the skills needed to drive a car over time. If they do not drive in favorable conditions, because the car is driving, how will the manufacturers expect them to be able to drive in hazardous conditions. Practice makes perfect; without practice, a driver will not be close to perfect. Switching to cars being driven by humans in times of unstable conditons could potentially cause more accidents.

Driverless cars might sound like a fantastic idea. When the different risks are taken into consideration, a human life should be more important than not having to drive. The reliability of the autonomous cars is not strong enough at this time to be considered safe. Humans should keep driving cars and computers should stick to sending text messages.",4
e275b16,"Have you ever wanted a car that drives its self ? I have, and i think it si a great and cool idea. If all cars were driverless and used as a transportation system and ran on electricty, there would be less pollution from diesel and gas from normal cars, Gas prices could go down a lot because of less usage in it, and with the technology, having a driverless car could potentially prevent wrecks. Driverless cars would be a great thing to have.

One reason having driverless cars is a good idea is because it could be more eco-friendly. less pollution would be produced if all cars were ran on electric and were driverless. Today's cars, trucks, etc.. cause a lot of the pollution in this world. electric, eco-friendly vehicles could lessen the amout of pollution.

Another reason to why driverless cars would be a good thing is; gas prices would go down because of less usage of it. No car would need gas and you might only need a gallon or two if you have to mow your lawn or something. it would save a lot of people money.

My final reason to having Driverless cars is, with the technology we have today, the could bulid the driverless cars to prevent wrecks. if all of the cars on the streets were driverless, there would be no problems caused. The cars would detect the others and prevent the crash. people could text and make phone calls all they want without having to worry about an accident. Texting and driving is a big issue and a major cause of most of today's accidents. A driverless car would cancel that number out becuase you cant text and drive without a driver.

All in all i think having a driverless car is a great idea. It will lower pollution on the earth, Lower gas prices signifigantly, and prevent a lot of wrecks caused by mistakes drivers make daily. i think car manufactuers should consider making driverless cars a big thing. ",3
d4658a2,"First, I dont agree with the making of driverless cars,there are too many faults that can happen with this technology. I believe technology consumes too much of our lives already, now they're trying to take the freedom away of driving yourself. When all the problems with this subject are fixed and the driveless vehicle is proven safe , I still won't support it.

There are many well thought out reasons I have on which people should not buy these cars. First of all who feels comfortable with letting the car drive itself with all the homocides and extremist group bombings going on. I don't know about you, but I will not put my life in a driverless cars' hands. Also with more technology comes more hackers to get into the software, which is going to be my next point.

An hacker can get into credit cards , computers, drones, and even phones which have all types of security to stop this. So what makes you think a driverless car can't be hacked some hackers might even call it mediocre to even try to be honest. So you could be in this ""driverless car"" as they say with your family and what if it gets hacked? I know for a fact the company which you bought it from is not going to have a track on each and every cars software status, you could be driven somewhere by the hacker without anyone even noticing because you just let the car control where you go. Once again I won't be letting this car take my freedom of driving .

From my standpoint I will never suport this idea. In the future to come I know these cars will be finalized and glitches fixed. The world will be completely run by all technology. Then we will see that one of the cars had a problem causing multiple fatalities. Once more evidence comes that these cars aren't fit for the world's problems going on they will stop being manufactured. Proving that as humans we should take the responsibility of driving ourselves around as it was before the idea of driverless cars evn generated.   ",3
4a779d5,"Space exploration is one of the most difficult and dangerous yet rewarding activities humans can pursue. With difficult conditions living in space, studying planets can take a toll on all sorts of people. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", an unknown author brings up the idea that exploring Venus presents many difficulties and dangers, but is rewarding enough to execute.

The author begins his essay by providing background on the planet, letting the audience know that Venus is the second planet from the sun and is difficult for humans to explore. In the second and third paragraphs, the author explores many difficulties surrounding the thought of studying Venus. First, he claims, no spaceships have landed on Venus in recent years. This allows readers to understand that compared to Mars, another planet close to Earth that humans are trying to settle on, studying Venus will be a challenge. The author continues by explaining the ridiculous temperatures and atmospheric conditions of Venus, claiming a sweltering 800 degrees Fahrenheit with a pressure that is 90 times greater than the pressure on Earth (""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"").. This alone causes the readers to double back, letting the audience know the dangers that come with even stepping foot on Venus. Furthermore, according to the author, Venus is well known for its frequent natural disasters, like earthquakes, volcanoes, and lightning strikes (""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""). Not only do unbelievable conditions exist at the surface itself, these sweltering temperatures also exist far above the planet. According to the author, temperatures would still be 170 degrees Fahrenheit even 30 miles above the surface, much hotter than the temperature 30 miles above the surface of Earth (""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""). The author later explains in the fifth paragraph that while exploring Venus would be tough, it would be possible. Knowing this information, the author convinces his audience that exploring Venus is a difficult task to accomplish.

However, despite all of these challenges the come with exploring Venus, the author still claims that learning more about the second planet in the solar system has its own benefits. In the fourth paragraph, the unknown author explains that Venus has many similar features with Earth. He claims that many astronomers are ""fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""). He provides similarities such as the similar ecosystems Venus may have supported and implies that Venus may have had a biodiverse world. The author communicated to the audience that even today Venus has many features that are similar to Earth, stating, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth"" (""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""). The author uses his facts and evidence to explain that life forms may have existed on Venus long ago. While the author does not explicitly state it, he is implying that studying Venus may help scientists learn how people from today's world can reside on Earth's ""twin"". This relates to current news with scientists and researchers learning how to develop and maintain life forms on another one of Earth's neighboring planets, Mars. As Venus has had many similar characteristics with Earth, the audience may realize that in the near future, the human population may grow to a number where it is necessary to settle on different planets. The unknown author uses evidence to explain that studying the atmosphere, solar power, and radiation levels of Venus would be important to support life on it.

In the last two paragraphs, the author explains a method that is currently being worked on by NASA, or The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the development of silicon carbide, which is a material that can withstand the conditions on Venus for a few weeks. Essentially, the author is explaining that exploring and studying Venus may be possible in the near future, allowing mankind to settle and develop on it.

In summary, the exploration of Venus may be one of the most difficult tasks mankind has yet to accomplish, but may also be one of the most rewarding. The sweltering temperatures even 30 miles above the surface of Venus and the astonishing atmospheric pressures on Venus causes a hesitation for space explorers in the exploration of Mars. Frequent natural disasters on the surface of Venus make it even harder for people to study the surface of Venus. However, beyond these dangers and difficulties, the author manages to prove to his audience that exploring Venus may be one of the best choices that man can make, potentially allowing the development of humans on another planet. But ultimately, it is up to The National Aeronautics and Space Administration to further develop silicon carbide technology so that mankind will be able to explore Venus and possibly, even inhabit it.",4
a08b804,"Want to know how it would be to be on the surface of venus? Scientists are trying to work on discovery on this planet closes to earth. Scientist want to be able study this planet because of how well this planet was once the most earth-like planet. They also been wanting to send people to venus so they can go and study the planet. Scientists also have been working on a vehicle to be able to be on venus surface.

Scientist have been working on studying this planet for a while now and it have got worst. This planet was once in the better condition in fact in the article it says ""Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. So scientist are still studying while knowing the danger this planet conditions are in.

Scientist have been working so hard to know about this planet and it conditions to know if there a safe way to arive on this planet without any struggles. In fact in the article it says ""The national aeronautics and space administration (NASA) has on particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus"". Scientist have been trying to find ways for this to happen.

NASA have been studying ways where humans can be on the surface of venus without getting in any danger. So NASA is trying to come up with a way to be able to stay on the surface of venus with a vehicle. In the article it says ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"". So they have been trying to come up with ways for humans to hover above the surface of venus.

With Scientist studying the planet because it was the most earth-like planet and with scientist trying to send humans to study this planet. Also with NASA trying to make a vehicle to stay 30 mile above surface so it would not be in any unfriendly ground conditions. Scientist are coming up with ways to explore this once earth-like planet.",3
414918c,"Dear. Mr. President,

I feel that we should change the Electoral collage to a direct vote. As the author states in source 2 ""Under the Electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors.."" I believe the people should have a better say in who gets to run the USA. We should aboilish the electoral collage because people need to be able to vote for the president himself not his slate of electors. Also some electors don`t actually vote for who they are representing, And the electoral collage is just not fair.

The people should have a better say in who their president gets to be. They shouldn`t be voting for the Slate electors, but should be voting for the president. Sometimes the votes get overulled by the popular vote. The electors really only focus on the swing states. That`s just not right at all.

Belive it or not some of the electors dont even vote for the president they are representing. It doesn`t make any sense to do that. The electors should be voting for who they represent. That just increases my points value. The people should be able to vote for who they want.

The electoral collage is just unfair. The state legislators pick the electors, and some of those electors could always defy the qill of the people. It is unfair to the voters mainly because of the winner take all system, They mainly only focus on the swing states. Sometimes people get confused about the electors anf vote for the wrong canidate.

Many people can`t figure out if they want to get rid of the Electoral collage are keep it in place. The Electoral collage should be gotten rid of because the people should have a say, and some elecotrs are not loyal and can go agaisnt the will of the people. In the wise words of Bob Dole ""Abolish the electoral collage!""    ",3
368eb7e,"United States of America, the land of the people right? When people think of America they think of freedom, so isn't it our job to keep it that way? With our electoral college, the people of America aren't truly given the right to where their vote matters. The electoral college has so many flaws such as the disaster factor, risk of a tie, and even how unfair it is to our countries voters.

The disaster factor is the risk that the electors could always defy the will of the people. The electors are picked by state legislatures, so it could easily happen where electors disobey the right citizens have and do what they choose, or the legislatures replace electors with malificent unpatriotic electors that will try to cheat the vote. How is that fair to us? Knowing that thousands and thousands of voters dedicate their time to focusing on which candidate is truly the most deserving, proactive, and thoughtfull. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...""

The Office of the Federal Register . Here was a time where had already been done, and it is sure to happen again.

Overall the electoral college is completely unfair with so many different problems that over rule the right of ther people. For example, ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning...""

The Office of the Federal Register , this shows how it is not really fair to all the states as even if the popular vote comes close, the winning candidate takes all the electoral votes.

It is possible as well for the electoral votes to tie for both candidates, in which case if this were to happen it would be a catastrophe, as the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. ""...the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from Calfornia, who represent 35 million voters""

The Office of the Federal Register . The population difference between the two is beyond comparable with California exceeding Wyoming with over 30 million voters. And to know that the two states would each get one vote? How is that, in any way possible, fair to American voters.

With so many problems with the electoral college and it being unimaginably unjust, the common thought would be how could this possibly still be the final word of our presidential election. If the Disaster factor, risk of a tie, and undoubting unfairness still haven't woken up our government, then how far and much destruction of our country's freedom will it take for the United States of America to truly be, the land of the people.

5bd2501,"Driveless Cars are the new future. I think that driveless cars will be very helpful and fun for everyone in the world. I think they would be helpful, entertaining, and useful. Although cars now are very useful, I believe that the Driveless Cars will be even more useful for the future.

Driveless Cars would be helpful to us because it could possibly cause us less accidents. Everyday there is an accident at least somewhere. The causes to some of these accidents could be texting, drinking and driving, not paying attention, or just bad roads. But the major one that we have is the texting and driving. There is over 50% that someone is either texting or on the phone with someone and they get in an accident. Drivless cars you don't have to do anything really. Yes you still have to pay attention but you can glance down a time or two. Also these cars will alarm you when to take over the car. They alarm you when it's bad traffic or if theres an accident ahead. It also has you take over once you are pulling in or out of a driveway. I think that it is very helpful for that because it'll most likley decrease the amount of accidents we could have a day.

Driveless cars just seem like it would be fun. Who wouldnt want a car that can go off on its own and need you to take control over only sometimes? You can actually enjoy yourself and look around. You are still paying attention to the road but just not as much as when you are driving. When you are driving you have to be focused on the road and other drivers at the same time. The driverless cars do that for you. They also watch you. They make sure that you still pay attention to the road. The car also gives you a second to prepare yourself for when you are about to take over. I think that it would just be enjoy able and fun to have a Driverless car.

Nobody likes to fill up their car and use money. Everybody hates how many times a week they have to stop and get gas. The driverless car uses half the fuel of todays taxis. They also offer a lot more flexibility than a bus. In the passage ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" Sergey Brin says ""He believes such cars fundamentally change the world."" (paragraph 1). This could be saving your money and very useful. Sergey Brin also predicts that he can see these Driverless Cars into a Public transport taxi system. That would be really useful to the world and again save a lot of our money.

In conclusion I think that the Driverless Cars would be Helpful, entertaining, and useful to our world. I think that it could really change our world and have a big impact on it. Although cars now are very useful, I believe that the Driveless Cars will be even more useful for the future. ",4
10b3a40,"In this writing prompt I will be supporting the authors argument. The author belives that Venus should be explored and belives exploring Venus would bring plentiful information that could help the world learn more about other plantes and ours. But for this to be an arguemnt there must be a danger or bad factor, the bad harmful factor is the dangers on Venus. Venus has many dangers that has harmed unmanned spacecrafts. More dangers will be explained further in the prompt.

Venus is often called Earths twin, Venus is the planet that is most related to earth in terms of density and size. But Venus has many more dangers than Earth. Venus has an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide wich means humans will not be able to breath the air. Venus's surface is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than earths pressure. Because of the extremely high amount of pressure that would crush a submarine and melt any metal humans would nto be caple of landing on the surface of Venus without being crushed. And not only does Venus have very high tempertures, pressure and a deadly atmosphere, it also has erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes.

So why would we want to explore Venus if it is so inhospitable? Venus may have once had been like earth, with oceans and lifeforms. Venus does have a rocky surface with valleys, moutains and craters. Venus could be the human races next planet to inhabit if an incident would occur to Earth. Venus is the planet that is most like earth with its terrain and possible past life and water. Although Venus has its deadly dangers to humans, scientists are creating ways for humans to explore Venus and learn about this twin planet.

"" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus,5)

that statement from the excerpt states that scientists have come up with their theorys to explore Venus. They have an idea to send Humans above Venus's atmosphere to explore Venus so they do not melt by the extremely high tempertures or get crushed by the high pressure. With these ideas humans could explore Venus without being harmed and could gather needed information about the twin planet. Scientists are also working on other approaches to studying Venus with possible electronic devices that could last possibly up to three weeks on Venus's surface. With more time scientists could create more ideas and plans to explore Venus's surface.

In this prompt I have explained the twin planet, Venus, and the dangers it holds. The author of the excerpt, "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. I have also explained the dangers Venus posses such as the high tempertures and the extremely high pressure. Scientists are creating more and more theorys of ways to explore

Venus everyday. Therefore in the future I do belive we will explore Venus and that exploring Venus would be very plentiful to the humans race.                  ",4
a79509d,"Driverless cars are important but will be more important in the future as they are being improved. Driverless cars exist and it is important that they make laws for them. Not everyone should be allowed to drive them, they should always required a human to control them in any type of way. They could be dangerous in hands of inresponsible people .They could change our lifestyles and also the way we see the world, they are helpful if the right person uses them. If they get improved, it would be best for everyone.

It is important to have laws for them if they get approved anyway as stated in paragraph 9, if an accident occurs, who would be blamed? And not only about those laws but a law that makes the manufactures of the driverless cars make every single person pay attention to the road and what he is doing because as said, the car could have a problem and the driver could possible not know abput it. It should be legal to drive a driverless car, not only because it could prevent accidents but because sometimes we get distracted when we know we should be focous on the road. The number of accidents would be lower with driverless cars even if some cars dont work as well. Is as if the driver is getting help from the car, the car is helping the driver just in case the driver messed up in a case.

Not everyone should be allowed to drive a driverless car. Some people are not responsible enough to get a car like that. Often, teenagers are very inresposible just because they are with their friends. They could think that the car is going to do everything for them and in the worst case the car doesnt react that there's something wrong and it crashes, what if the teenager dies, shouldn't the teenager had to controlled the car even though he knew it could control itself? People with a certain level of maturity should be allowed to drive driverless cars.

Driverless cars could be so helpful if the right person is on the wheel. The driver should always concentrate on the road, no matter if their car is driverless. It could change society if they actually used them right. Traffic would be different, we get stuck into traffic sometimes because a person drives too slow, because a person drove too fast and caused an accident, and many other reasons and with driverless cars it could sometimes prevent this, not all the time but it would lower the risk of getting in an accident. Manufactures should try to improve them at their best, not only because some people wouldn't use them right but because people sometimes messes up too.

Driverless car would be the best to improve a lot of things such as traffic and accidents. If the majority of US had driverless cars, things would change for the better. They are helpful with the right drivers and with the right laws. Not every company should be allowed to drive them but companies that are being supervised and companies that are trustable. Only responsible people should be allowed to drive them since they would actually just be using the help of the car and not using the car to do everything for them. They also shouldn't be a lot more expensiv. People driving them should always take the same preventions as if they were driving a normal car as said in paragraph 7, it requires human skills.",4

Then the most unsual thing happened, the spacecraft spotted a ""shadowy likeness of a human face."" NASA is trying to prove that the Face is nothing but a natural landform. Since not everyone was satisfied, NASA continued to explain that the Face has nothing to do with Alien Monument.

NASA's discovery is leading to an argument over whether it was formed by aliens or if it is just a natural landform. The text states, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien amrkings were hidden by haze."" This evidence shows how people continue to believe that the Face could've have alien marking all around it, but they couldn't have been spotted because it was winter on the Red Planet so it was very cloudy to spot anything like that. Then on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for a second look. The text states ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.""

f95fef1,"I can imagine a time without people buying cars for themselves. But isn't that what we're trying to escape from in the technology world? Don't we want to be free of becoming lazy slobs? So how would inventing a car that can drive itself be useful?

I don't believe having self drivable cars would be necassarily a good idea. The reason why I say that is because no one would ever expierence the joy in buying their first car. No one would feel the excitment when passing their driver's test. Life would be a little bit more boring than what it's already becoming.

Also, what about malfunctions in having a self driving car. Like the paragraph said, would it be blamed on the owner or the manufactorer? I personally would blame the manufactuour for not checking in these precautions. It's very necassary to make sure all precautions and functions have been checked before selling a self drivable car.

So what woud happened if an accident were to happen? We'd blame the car, corret? If we're not driving the car and the car functions on itself, in reality it would be the car's functions fault for causing damaging. Now I can imagine a world without people buy cars, but can you imagine a world without fascination? I can if self driving cars become reality.",3
aa24022,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. From the dangers said in the article, it's more supporting the reasons as to why scientists shoud not pay a visit to Venus. Before a reader can make their decision, the last point made in the article has said that dangers should not limit anyone pursuing a goal. While that statement has been said, there is more mention of the pessimistic side thorughout the entire article. Said author has supported the idea of exploring Venus in poorly way.

At the beginning, it has introduced Venus to be peaceful on the outside. As the author describes the weather conditions beyond the clouds, danger lies ahead. Readers will think to themselves that the article is trying to pursuade them not to visit Venus. In the article, ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades,"" (2) the author has described the risks all the way until paragraph 5. It isn't until the ending of paragraph six when the author tries to start pursuading to the reader that there are solutions hastily.

Beginning or paragraph seven in the article, the author wrote about the new technology that could advance if scientists were to visit Venus. While this can be pursuading, only new technology and knowledge will be found. According to the article, ""Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin,"" (7) it will be difficult if Venus has melted the robots sent there. If the author had been more pursuasive when they mentioned the possibility of creating new technology, then the negativity would have been beneath.

Last of all, paragraph eight has the smallest paragraph out of all. The author explains that curiousity will drive scientists to meet the challenges of Venus. It can be infered to the readers that the author has made little pursuation upon taking on Venus. In the article, ""...human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors,"" the author did not support their idea for this section. Reading the last paragraph is not enough to truly support the idea of exploring Venus any further due to the lack of motivation.

Author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" has not supported the idea thoroughly. With too much description of the weather, their pursuation not enough to support their idea, and their lack of motivation, the readers can infer that this article is not well supporting the main idea of visiting Venus. Readers can misunderstand the message at the beginning. The author could have lossened the negativity and add more reasons as to why visiting Venus is important.    ",5

Venus is the brightest point of light in the night sky on Earth any amateur stargazer could point to it,

it is also called the Evening star but Venus is actually a planet in our solar system which is the second closest to the sun but from hear on Earth it looks really calm and not much harm that could happen but it is a very rigid place.It is often reffered to as the twin planet of Earth since it has the same size and density of Earth.

Humans have sent numerous amount of spacecrafts to land on this cloud draped world but no spacecraft has lasted more than a few hours because Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that blankets Venus, to make the matters worse the clouds are highly corrosive sulfure acid in the atmosphere and the planets temperature avergaes over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the planets atmospheric pressure is far more greater than what we experience here on Earth.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA0 want to test a theory of theres by sneding humans over to Venus, since the planet is like fire to every sinlgle thing over there on ground they would send jet airplanes to avoid risking anyones life and to stay away from the surface.

NASA would like to take samples from the surface like the rocks, gas, water and so more but they cannot get the materials from a far enough distance they would have to moe upclose and take the risk of stepping on the surface.     ",1
48fdee7,"I personally agree and disagree with this idea. First, i agree because it seems like a really good idea, it will make driving more fun and exicting. Not all people like to drive all the time so why not have a car do your job in driving for you? Its a cool thing to show off, Lots of people are fasinated with this car. Their cars has driven half a million miles without a crash, but you can never be sure when one is bound to happen. It would change the world though. People wil be facscinated with this car and would want to try it out.

I also disagree because, this can be a very dangerous thing to do. You never know what could happen having the car drive itself. It could mess up without warning and bad things could happen such as crashes and wrong turns. The sensor they put inside the car could lose itsself and not see people walking across the street, then now you have an accident. You always want to make sure you and your peers or pedestrians are safe. You just cannot make sure of that with a driver-less car. If a negative thing would happen while driving this car, it would create a bad look on the people who made the cars because, they've said so many positive things about the effects of this car, what it can and cant do, so people are depending on the manufactures to keep their word.

I just disagree because, the world is crazy and you never know what could happen. People could get hurt such as pedestrians, other drivers could lose their car due to accidents, manufacturers could lose their job due to an unhappy customer. It seem too dangerous. This car has its pro's and con's. It could be a fun entertaining thing to do, but you should also worry about your safety.",3
666d674,"The use of this new technology to read the emotional expressions of students is valuable. If we can read the emotional expressiions of students in the classroom then we might be able to use that to determine if they are understanding the work that has been given to them.

Just like they did with the Mona Lisa we could do the same in the classrooms. They determined her emotions in the picture so we could determine the emotions of a student to see if they understand what they are working on. If they are confused or dont understand some5thing then the teacher could help them and get them to better understand the work given to them.

If the student does understand the work given to them then there is nothing to worry about. When the student undrstands the work that is given to them, then the teacher doesnt have to work with that student one on one to give extra help. If the student undrstands it very well then they might be able to help another student that doesnt understand it as much, then the teacher won't have to work with that certain student one on one.

With all that being said there is no reason that we shouldnt use this technology in classrooms. This technology cant harm us. This technology is going to help us in the classrooms. If we dont understand something and dont let the teacher know then how can he/she help us. If we use this technology and see that they dont understand something then we can work with them so that they can better understand the work.",3
cdb7f7e,"Do you think teachers should have the technology to read the emotional expessios of students in a classroom? I think it is valuable for teachers to be able to read the expressions on our face, because if a teacher can't read what a student has trouble with then they will keep geting it wrong. Or if a student is sad the teacher need to know so she can try to help you. Also a teacher should be able to tell when we are happy so they know we are going to try are harded to keep up the good work and make the teachers and prantes pround so we can be happy all the time.

Let's say your getting fustadued at a teacher and the teacher can't tell so she won't help, beacuse your afraid to tell her then you get in trouble because you went off on the teacher. The teacher send you to the office and then your parents have to come in and talk and you tell them what happend then they wont beleive you because they would of thought you would of said something or at least asked for them to help.

If your happy and a teacher can tell thats always a good think because then they wont try to make you mad because they dont know what made you happy or how. so the hint is just teast others like you want to be treated because if you don't karma will come back your way. The way the teachers see it the more work your willing to turn in the less the will give you so dont burn your bridges.

Now do you think we teachers should be able to read there studens face? Well i do because if there not able to school can be so much harder and there will be conquinces like grades drop and you just don't want to do anything anymore. So therefore thats why I think teachers need to have the technolgy to read our faces. Students would like school so much more if the teachers were able to understand what has happened and how much pressure it would take off of us.",3
73e244a,"Driverless cars are a futuristic dream for many people. But now that they are becoming a reality some people support driverless cars and some do not support driverless cars. Driverless cars can be dangerous and could fail and hurt someone. Driverless cars should not be sold or used until they fix the danger involved. Making them safe for the public to drive.

Danger is a big worry to the world, understandably to because many people die in automotive accidents. Some beleive that driverless cars can solve that danger involved in driving. But in truth it could be more dangerous than a human driving. The technology involved in everyday life can be troublesome and does not want to work all the time, so the technology involved in driverless cars could easily behave the same way. Most people have had a problem with their wifi or their phone acting up and not working before. The technology in driverless cars could just as easily do the same thing, and that could indanger millions of people.

Driverless cars take away human control and human error, but it gives control to technology and computers, in turn giving way to technology errors. Many people dont want their families getting hurt do to a technology error when they could of had control and been fine. Human control is very important when talking about families and friends. So until they can be absolutly sure the technology wont fail and can maintain control driverless cars should not be driven for everyday use. ",3

if we limit our car usage people would start walking wich is good. people are getting so used to cars that they have no excersise all they do is get in there car go to work and home wich is not good. if we limit the car usage all those people will have to walk wich would be better so they can have some type of excersise. if people needed to travel far distances they would have public transportation.

if we do limit the car usage there will be less pollution in the air. and if there is less pollution in the air there will be less congestion. there would be less smog in the air. where would be less people getting sick.

another advantage we will have is that people will be saving money. people wouldnt have to pay for gas. since people are walking they wouldnt have to pay for car insurance. people wont need to pay for car damages. and with all the money that people save most people wouldnt go in debt.

this are some reasons why i think we should limit car usage. now you write to inform our citizens why we should limit the car usage.                                                                 ",2
24e6449,"Some claim that a picture of a natural landmark and a shadow is really a sign of alien lifeform or a civilization. Nasa a billion dollar company dissagrees and has proof that this is indeed a landmark with a shadow and not any sort of alien life. That has not stopped some conspiracy theorists from saying that this is a cover up.

Nasa as we all know is a company that is paid to fly unmanned and sometimes manned aircraft into the sky and most excitingly space. That is a positive thing for us humans who have no idea why we are here and how are we here. People don't like to know or believe the truth and sometimes make up lies or takes something the wrong way and make everyone from the news to the everyday household hear about something that didn't even turn out to be true. That is the same case here, Nasa released a photo of a mountain during a time of day that would have shadows, and Nasa being a public and government company is forced by law to release photos to the people. Which leads to more proof if Nasa took more photos that showed aliens or other inteligent lifeforms they would have to release it they can't just magicly hit erase.

Conspiracy theorist still do not believe Nasa so they demand more photos and still Nasa has even more proof that this ""face'' is indeed a montain with shadows stratigicly placed to look like a human face. Theorist say that everything Nasa does is either faked or fixed to look like something it is not. In this case it went viral and many people still believe it was aliens that went there and did that but Nasa declines and this time Nasa has a little more proof.

Nasa would've got money to send a human or a robot to Cydonia if it were a human lifeform or an alien, and we all know the team that worked on it would've got some pretty heavy paychecks just by working on the case, just imagine that checks the team would make if it were a civilivation. But Nasa will not be sending over humans or a robot for a couple reasons, the best reason is that the already know that this is just a mountain, not a civiliation.

In conclusion Nasa knows this is a mountain and not a lifeform of any kind.

Nasa also knows that lifeforms like ours can not survive on the surface of any planet without an atmousphere like mars. So even if a lifeform can survive without oxygen unlike us that the proof of that area says otherwise.   ",4
39dad0d,"Dear Senator,

My name is PROPER_NAME. It would be beneficial to keep the electorial college because it is in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congree and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, if we used just popular vote candidtates would just go to bigger states like Florida, California, Texas, and Georgia and win the popular vote, and lastely without the electorial college there would be a greater chance of a dispute.

Five reasons to keep the electiorial college are:

1. Certainty of Outcome

A dispute over the outcome of an Electorial College vote is possible but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote because the winning candidate's share of the Electorial College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

Almost all states award electorial votes on a winner take all bases.

This means that if a president wins 51 percent of a states popular vote they win 100 percent of the Electorial votes.

In the 2012 election Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electorial vote, but only 51.3 percent of the popular vote.

Althought a tie in the electorial vote is possible because there is an even 538 votes it is highly unlikely.

2. Everyone's President

The Electorial College requires a presidential candidater to have a trans-regianal appeal, what this means is that no regian has enough electorial votes to elect a president.

Therefore a president with only one regional appeal is unlikely to be succesful.

If the president could win the electorial vote with just one regions votes the other regians would feel disenfranchised and feel that the president wouldn't care about what they want or need.

3. Swing States

The winner-take-akk method of awarding electorial votes makes candidates focus on states called swing states.

These voters in the swing states are most likely to bve the most thoughtful voters and they are the ones that decide most elections.

An example of a swing state is Florida.

Florida always changes between Republican and Democrat and having 29 electoirial votes that is a big deal.

4. Big States

The electorial College gives back some of the weight in big states that they lose in the senate where every state has only 2 representatives.

Florida is also a big state having 29 electorial votes.

This makes Florida even more attractive to candidates to visit because it is both a swing state and a big state.

5. Avoid Run-Off Elections

The Electorial College avoids a problem in which no candidate receives a majority of the vots cast.

The Electorial College takes away that complication by providing a clear winner.

Lastley if popular vote was used candidates wouldn't have to go to a variety of states, they could go to the same big states including California, Florida, Texas, Georgia, and Washington.

Just winning the majority of these states they could win the whole election.

This would cause smaller states like Ohia, North and South Dakota, and Michigan to not be a piece of the election as much because of their low population.

I hope this helps you decide what to do about the decision between Electorial College and Popular Vote.

Think about the smaller states.

They don't want to be left out.

Thanks,

597f576,"The technological age has advanced to the point of being able to calculate the complex emotions of the Mona Lisa, and there's proposal for moving into classrooms as well. However, this is a sentiment that must be rejected wholeheartedly. Despite possible learning benefits, facial recognition technology in the classroom would be ineffective and would constitute an invasion of privacy.

Facial recognition software would be an ineffective addition to the classroom environment. In paragraphs 5 and 6, D'Alto writes of how the computer can sense emotions just like humans can, stating, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" The human body has a natural ability to sense emotions within others by performing calculations based on the subtle body movements of others. Even if a machine could replicate this, as the article suggests, it doesn't dimish the face that humans already possess this capability. No emotion detecting software currently available provides anything that a human being couldn't detect, therefore adding them to the classroom would only be providing information that the teacher could already know. Teachers can detect boredom, stress, and enjoyment just like the computer would, and, if they so wish, they can change their lesson appropriately. Technology that reads emotions would be innefective and unneeded in the classroom.

Software that can read emotions could, in a classroom, invade the personal, privite lives of the students its watching over. Due to the nature of being a computer, the technology could, as stated in paragraph 6, ""'...recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'"" The level of understanding stops at simply recognizing the emotion; a computer cannot discern the reason behind each emotion because it only detects that the emotion is there. Now place that into a classroom, where students from all different backgrounds are coming together to learn, and there will be some students that have had a rough day. Something happened outside of school that was out of their control, and they're just trying to make it through the day and avoid conversation about it. Sadly, they walk into class, and a computer, which a teacher is giving a lesson, notices that the student is distracted and continually pesters them to pay attention, even though the student's interest is not on schoolwork at all. Life is not contained to just the classroom, and external factors will effect a student's emotion before, during, and after class. Those factors could be incredibly personal, but the technology, not being able to sense anything other than emotion, analyzes this personal part of someone's life as much as it would do a bored kid in class. This is a blatant invasion of students' privacy and needs to be prevented from doing such.

D'Alto argues that the technology could provide substancial benefits to the classroom by creating personalized programs for each student to remain interested, but this process would just prove overall inneffective or exhorbitantly expensive to implement. To provide reason for this technology being implemented in classes, D'alto states in paragraph 6 that ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This has to be looked at in two different scenarious: a group class and a personalized class. For the group class, modifying the lesson would be overall inneffective because it would cause other students that used to be enjoying class to become bored and lethargic, thus prompting the computer to modify the lesson. The cycle would continue until the end of class, with the technology switching teaching methods so often that calling the class coherent would be blatant lying. This modification method would only work if each student had their own computer modifying the lesson. In that scenario, each student would be personally invested into what they were learning. However, it also means that each student would need their own computer that holds this technology. For technology that currently is too complicated for ordinary computers to comprehend, that would require schools to invest exhorbitant amounts of money purchasing new computers that could hold this software. For every student to have a computer would be way too expensive for any implementation to be cost-effective. Despite possible learning benefits, the technology would either be too expensive to be implemented or too innefective to be used.

It's an interesting concept to imagine a world where computers are able to sense emotions and create a personalized program for each person on Earth. However, this imagination is riddled with expenses, invasion of privacy, redundancy, and overall inneffectivity. As the technology age progresses, it's important to remember to leave teaching to the teachers.",6
7b69c8e,"My claim is going to be on the negative aspect on driverless cars. The one of the reasons that I am going to use is road problems. Also the next problem that I am going to be talking about is a pass for the drivers crime on a crash. The next thing I am going to talk about is the finacial rate. These are the most troubling thing that are running around in my mind.

The first of the many problems is the road problems that can hurt any one on the road. If there is a sewer problem in the middle of the street that the city workers are working on the driverless cars won't have a way to detect the workers. Yes they might install a camera or a sensor to indicate that and alert the driver, but it can alert him to late and the result on that is there is already a crash. Also the car can't tell whether their is a red light or a green light it can only go to the direction it was programed to go to. There can be many more problems that anyone else can say that I'm not saying and think to your self's ""why do they need to alert you before the car doesn't know how to drive a certain way"".

The second reason for the negative aspect of the driverless cars is the passes on a crash. I think that if a person is going to court for getting in a crash because of his driverless car. I am not saying that he should get punished for buying that car, but they should understand that that they should be watching the road. And if someone says that the were sleeping while the car was driving they should go to jail for it. Their might be a worst punishment for it, but they should already know the bad side of the driverless car is not a game.

The last reason i am going to talk about is the finacial rate. Well I should call it money problems for everyone, but I wanted to sound smart. The company will have to sell them expensive prices because of the hardware, software, and other technology that is being combined with the car is not cheap. The people that would want to buy or rent it would have to do alot of work just to buy the car. Buy alot of work I mean he has to win the lottery and still work to still make payments on the car.

There is alot more reasons but i leave it up to the different people that are going to write about it. I hope to the people that read this that there is a positive and a negative side to everything. But it is your life but make the right choices and make sure don't make any mistakes. And i wish you the best and the wish you good luck out there in the driverless car world.",3
db84c1b,"Driverless cars are a thing of the future.

They are said to hanndle conditions under a twenty five mile per hour speed.

Also they give the wheel to the driver to make sure that the driver can be in complete control over the situation.

Should driverless cars enter the development stage?

Driverless cars should not be in development for the follow reasons: malifunction error of the system or programming and not enough regulations for driverless cars.

Automakers have been battling with the lack of regulations for a long time.

Most automobile laws are focussed on keeping the passangers and others safe from harm.

But what laws are inforcing driverless cars?

Today, laws are in place under the assumption that there is a human driver always behind the wheel.

In fact, it has become illegal to test the driverless cars in California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia.

The lawmakers would have to put new laws regulating driverless cars in case of an accident.

Automakers are still working on the self-driving car thinking that the problems will be solved ahead.

Will the government actually buy into the idea?

Driverless cars rely heavily on the technology built within them.

What if that was a problem? What if the technology within the car was to mallifunction?

Automakers rely heavily on the sensors arround the car.

The sensors arround the car are there to insure the safety of the passangers and others arround the car.

In the article, it didn't hint to the performance of these cars in extreme wheather.

If the system were to mallifunction would it give the driver complete controll and shut down the systems, or would it lose control causing an accident?

Humans have relied on technology for a long time, after a while the technology starts to decrease in performance.

What would be the cost to replace parts of the system of driverless cars?

There is also the problem of convincing others to buy the car if it starts to sell.

Would every American want to buy the car, or would they stick with driving the car themselve?

Humans driving cars are not a thing of the future.

In fact, the very first car to sell always had someone driving the car.

Human drivin cars have been arround for a long time and the introduction of self driving cars have been arround for roughly fifteen years.

Driveless cars should not start development for the following reasons: malifunction error of the system or programming and not enough regulations for driverless cars.

Until automakers insure one hundred percent liability, then develpoment of the cars will be taken into consideration.",4

I am here to talk about why we should agree that being a seagoing cowboy is a really good idea so hang on tight and just listen, hope u enjoy .

Some good reasons to be a seagoing cowgirl/boy is you get to help animals while your traveling over sea. Also its a good experience and you might want to learn about the ocean, thats a good reason to be a seagoing cow girl or boy and you might want to try it out .There might be some big waves but your with animals traveling and helping out thtas important to do .Its also a beautiful ,wonwerful,aventure to explore .

I support Luke becuase he says thats its an one one life oppertunity. It was he got to travel over seas to Europe ,he went pass Greece . He also traveled over the Pacific Ocean twice,and the Artic Ocean 16 times .Its a good aventure and you should try it one day .

So he got to do alot of things that were totally awsome! I want to know do you think you should try it one day yes or no ? And please right about why you whould and who inspired you ?",2

The fun part is that you can stay up all night and you get to never wake up unless its your job to feed the animals.

Luke's claims are having fun and being with his best friend. Luke also knew it would be a lif time opportunity. Luke was watching out for ahead and checking on the animals then he went to tell captin that when the ladder was wet and slippery. Luke fell and his heart pounding like a hammer.

8011911,"In the past, there has been much debate among scientists concerning the ""Face on Mars"". A picture was taken of a certain region of the Red Planet called Cydonia by Viking 1 in 1976. The image developed into what appeared to be a human face on the planet's surface. Some argue it is an alien artifact, but it is just a natural landform.

When scientists first studied the image in 1976, they infered that ""the Face"" was just another Martian mesa. Past research proves that Martian mesas and rock formations are common in the region of Cydonia, where the picture was snapped. Therefore, it is highly likely that ""the Face"" is just another natural landform with uncommon shadows.

Upon releasing the image for all to see, NASA captioned the picture ""huge rock formation..."" along with other descriptions. Some argued that it was an alien atrifact, so NASA decided to attempt something else. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor along with Michael Malin and the Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped another picture of ""the Face"". The articles states the the image was ""ten times sharper than the original Viking photos"". This image proved that ""the Face"" was a rock formation, but there were still skeptics. Some still argued that it was an alien artifact, the picture was taken on a cloudy day, and alien markings were hidden by haze.

So, NASA responded yet again. The article states in the tenth paragraph ""on April 8, 2001---a cloudless summer day in Cydonia---Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look"". It also says ""each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo"". Scientists carefully analyzed the photo. In paragraph twelve, it says ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West"". The natural landform on Mars was similar to landforms on the planet Earth.

The similarity of landforms on the two planets prove many things. The image proved that ""the Face"" is just a rock formation with unusual shadows. Also, it adds another similarity between the Earth and Mars. So, for all those skeptics out there, there's a small chance that life may still be out there on Mars. Who knows?",4

For one, if you are an animal lover you get a chance to help the animals on the cattle boat. As it says in the text, ""On his second trip, Luke seved as a night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour.""

The second reason is that even though you are serving around the world you still get to go sight seeing. In paragraph five it says, "" Luke also toured an exavated castle in Crete and maveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.""

The third reason is that you get to be of sevice around the world to help countries after World War II. In the story it says, ""To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, forty-four nations joined together to form UNRRA (The United Stations Relief and Rehabilitation Administation).""

75f83cd,"In the 1950s, automakers started to develop what was to become one of the first steps toward creating a driverless car and made a car that could run itself on a special test track. Then, in the 1980s, automakers everywhere started using speed sensors. These were the things that began the advancement of the driverless car. The driverless car can now detect and respond to danger; steer, accelerate, and brake itself; and is predicted to use less fuel and offer more flexibility which makes it the ideal car to have.

The sensors that the automakers in the 1980s used have advanced greatly and is able to detct and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids and rollovers. These advanced sensors can also apply brakes to individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, avoiding danger much more successfully than a human driver could manage alone. This also saves expenses on wrecks and is a lot more safe for the driver.

The driverless car can also steer, accelerate, and brake itself. Some can even warn the driver when they are in danger of backing into an object, though all are designed to notify them when confronting obstacles that require human skills such as navigating around work zones and accidents. Even so, the driverless car can largely manage manage things on its own.

The driverless car, if its also converted to a public-transport taxi system, is predicted to use half the fuel today's taxis do and also offer more flexibility than a bus. This public-transport taxi system could also put an end to the world's need to buy cars, also saving the population money on car expenses.

So, in conclusion, the driverless car can save people money on car and accident expenses, reduce the risk of accidents, and save fuel, which can be better used elsewhere. Driverless cars are definitely something worth developing because who wouldn't want extra cash and lower risks of accidents? ",3
e576be9,"There was an funny looking landform on Mars. That other scientist had tooken a picture of in 1976 and mars that look like a face icon. the picture was blurry and we couldnt really tell what it was so many people had did research on it. Many scientist like me and different people thought it was different things. Like just a regular natural landform in Mars and others think it is a face that a lien had left there to show a icon. We also had a arguent over what it really was. Me as a scientist and other people that thought it was a icon that aliens marked.

I, as a scientist disagree about what many people think it is. I personally think its just a regular natural landmark in Mars. Others think its a icon for something a alien made because its shaped as a face a few scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. Some people think the face is nonafide evidence of real life on Mars. Us scientist had describe the icon which resembles a human head . its formed bve shawdows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and a mouth. This have attracted alot of people attention to Mars.

This icon have became very popular. For example in pargargraph 5 its says "" its starred in Hollywood Films, appeared in books, magazines, and is in radio talk shows. This shows that the icon is really popular and many people know and talk about the icon.

Around April 5 in 1998 Mars global flew over Cydonia for the first time and took a better picture of the icon for we can tell what it was more cleary then the other pictures they had. We discovered that it was just a natural landforn and there wasnt no alien icon.

There was nothing else really said about the natural landform because we know what it is now but we also know that its not essay to target Cydonia.",3

For example some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted up to at least three weeks in such conditions. By comparison systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure and heat and in all other forces.

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" would take more than a few years for our researchers to figurer a way to collect the data from the planet. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. Venus has value not because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself. But also because of human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doughts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.                           ",1
8919405,"The author supports this idea that studying venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers because venus is the second planet from our sun. While venus is simple to see from the distant away but still safe . Earth, Venus, and mars are the planetary neighbor, that will go aroud the other planets. Venus is very close to the sun . Venus is just like a evening star that they call it in different places.

Each previous mission was unmanned, and for more than a few hours. They always tried to watch venus the planet to see if there was anything new or they need to know something about it . Venus is kinda hot just like the sun becuase they are both close together. Even the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. The conditions can get far more extreme then humans which can get very bad.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. Venus will be able to allow scienctists to see more thing and allow them to float above the fray. Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only provide a little amount of stuff that will go on. Venus is can be very dangous because it is so hot and u will not be able to vist it because it is so hot u will die from it . The sun and venus are the hottest out there .

The comparison system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat , and other forces. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size . Occasionally the closest in distance too . Numerous factors contributw to venus's repuatation as a challenging planet for humans to study , desprite its proximity to us . The thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.

Venus has a lot to get things from just like if you look up venus you probably can get alot from it . For scientists to get alot of things from venus they problaby have to get like a machian to see venus since its hot .They have to make sure the mechians are good to go on there so they make sure nothing happens to the mechiane . Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even through mercury is closer to our sun. That is what you learn about venus and how it is . ",3

I knew that it would be neat experience, but it was more that just a neat experience. It was a wonderful and unique experience, the people I worked with were wonderful.

How long did it take to get there? What if I don't like the jobs there and the people are rude? Are the jobs boring? What if its not the same as it was when you were there? I don't like those kind of jobs where you have to go overseas.

It took a while to get there, but it was worth it! I got to explore unique places and unbelievable sights. Working there keeps you busy, but you get to work with great people and the jobs are usually fun even if they sound boring.

Is it a unique adventure getting there? What if I don't like the way they do things and your telling me a different story?

When my friend told me that it would be a neat adventure, I got excited, but it was way more than that, we rode in on a cattle-boat, so we got to explore the Panama Canal and much more! Being a Seagoing Cowboy allowed me to experience unique places and an important thing is, it made me more aware of people and their countries. It helps you learn how to help and care more about people, you should go be a Seagoing Cowboy because it was an awesome experience!        ",3
0a238c3,"Driverless cars have been in all of our minds since television and moives have put them there. Google has had driverless cars since 2009, but are they safe to be in one. While haveing a driverless car seems epic it does have some downfall to it. Driverlesss cars , or smart cars, are a bad idea because it cost a large amount of money, a driver must be on the wheel and on alert at all times, and it even has problems with the law.

Driverless cars in the late 1950s had to run on a special track. The smart-road systems worked well. It was actully a succesful test, but it would have require massive upgrades to the existing roads. The roads would be too expensive to upgrade. So instead of smart-roads they moved on to smart cars. The smart cars would need a lot of sensors to work. The senors would of course become more advance, but so well the cost.

Although the smart cars cost a large amount it also still needs a driver at the wheel. The car can handle speeds up to 25mph, but the sensors make sure the dirver hold on to the wheel. Even though it is a smart car none of the cars can go without a driver at the wheel. The car would need a driver for roads it can't navigat thourgh. Such as work zones and around accidents. The car can not navigat thourgh these places which is why it alerts the driver that the need to take control of the wheel. To improve this the manufacturers put cameras in the smart car to watch driver. They make sure that the driver is focused on the road. If there is a road the car needs help with, it would vibrate the seat to alert the driver.

Even if the car can alert the driver the law focus on on how focused the driver is. In some states it is illegal to test a computer-driven car. Such states worry the the car would cause an accident to the passengers, and pedestrians. If the traffic laws change it would still need to cover liability of the accident. So if the car fails and caused an accident would the driver or manufacturer be at fault.

So in the end driverless cars are a horribly idea. They would cost a large amount of money. As well as they are not actully driverless and needs someone to be there, and they are agist the law at some states. Driverless cars should just stay in television and moives.",4
1e44008,"The driverless cars would be something people would like to have but they may not be very safe. There is the same amount of negative aspects as well as positive aspects of the cars. I am mostly against the the development of the driverless cars.

The cars have sensors to alert the drivers if they are heading towards something dangerous or the car deal with the circumstance they're in. The cars have gone miles without crashing but still need a driver. What if the car is in traffic issues where the driver needs to be in control and the sensor is broke and can't alert the driver? The driver could stop paying attention for one second and the car could wreck. The sensors could also malfunction and run into something when it was supposed to brake.

The car also vibrates and has flashing lights to warn the driver. The vibration and lights could become dull and the driver may not notice them. The driver could then wreck or get hurt because he or she didn't know they were supposed to drive or not.

There are not laws to protect someone if there is an accident. The car could fail and no one would know who to blame. It is illegal to drive these cars in most states because they're not fully safe. What if someone thinks they're safe and the laws pass to where people can drive them but they malfunction? Who would get in trouble? The driver or the manufacturer?

Even though they could be safer than a person driving, the car is still not completely safe. There are good qualities of the car like the warning signs and the entertainment while people aren't driving but those could break. The technology of the car could fail and hurt someone or multiple people. Some could think that the car is durable but they would still need to take precautions.   ",3
69e3274,"In this article, the author talks about the dangerous it presents in Venus. Venus is Earth like planet, it supports some forms of life. It has some valleys, mountains, and craters, similar to Earth. It would be a great option for space travel. However, the author discusses that there are many challenges to study Venus.

Venus is almost impossible for human to live. The atomospheric pressure in Venus is 90 times greater than it is in Earth. The temperature is 800 degrees fahremheit average. The author says that, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes makes researcher harder to approrch.

Author did a good job of showing specific number to makes reader easier to understand his idea, such as showing 800 degrees or 90 times more. Also, he showed ""dangers"" by making many comparasion to Earth, which is very familiar to us and it ade easier for us to understand.

In conclusion I think author well supported his idea. The author first showed why it is worthy to study Venus. And then, he discussed what type of dangers are present. ",2
10159ff,"The author suggestes studying Venus because it is a very interresting planet because it could also be dangerous and we will be able to study it. Venus is also know as the ""Evening Star"", but they also say that the name Evening Star is mis leading because Venus is actually a planet. Venus is the second planet from the sun which can probably be a reason why it can be so hot. we can see Venus from a distance because its safe, but scienstes say that it can be really dangerous up close. Its so dangerous that a spacecaft hasn't landed on Venus in over 30 decades.

Venus has many things to discover about it but, some have been discovered about the planet. Venus is referred to as Earth's ""twin,""because its the closet to planet Earth in terms of size,density and distance to other planetary neighbor but, orbits the sun at different speeds. Earth is sometimes closer to Mars and sometimes Venus is closer. Venus has the highest surface temperture even through Mercury is closer to the sun. The planet Venus has a thick atomsphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. The average temperatures of Venus is over 800 degress.

33568ce,"Everybody in the world has emotions and displays them in different ways. One common way people display emotions are through their facial expressions. However, it is not always easy for people to read others' emotions. In the article, Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author talks about a new computer software called the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) that was used to read the famous Mona Lisa's emotions. In the article, the author mentions this software being used in a classroom setting to read students' emotions to tell if they are confused or bored to modify the lesson like an actual teacher. The use of this software in a classroom would be extremely beneficial for students who struggle staying focused or are not interested in learning at all.

A student sits in class doing a computer lesson. However, this student is unable to sit still in their seat for a fraction of a second because of how bored they have become with the lesson. If the FACS was in use, the student would have a much easier time being engaged in their learning. If classes were to use facial recognition software for lessons, when students become frustrated or confused, the lesson will be able to adjust to the students' needs instead of having the students become frustrated with their teachers. Dr. Huang predicts if this kind of software was used in a class, the lessons would be able to modify ""like an effective human instructor."" The FACS would be extremely beneficial to students and teachers alike! However, some people would not agree with the claim that facial recognition software should be used in a classroom.

Someone might believe that the use of the FACS would not be helpful for students in a classroom setting. They may believe that the software is an unnecessary use of resources because they might not believe the software is effective because it may be unable to detect emotions in an effective way. In the article, it states that the Mona Lisa was ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" They may believe that if the software detects mixed emotions, it would not be useful.

However, this claim is wrong in every sense of the word. The computer software is accurate enough to tell a real smile from a fake smile through the muscles that are being moved in the face. The software uses a 3-D computer model of the face and compare the expression of a user's face to a neutral face. ""All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles,"" so there is no way it cannot be accurate!

The use of the Facial Action Coding System for computer lessons would be an extremely beneficial addition to the classroom setting. It would make teaching and learning a lot more easier for teachers and students alike. School administrations should take serious consideration when deciding whether or not to integrate this software into teaching.",4

Although the computer cannot read how you really feel because sometimes people lie about what they do and dont like. So just because you rate that website a 7 doesnt mean you like it you might just want them to think its a good website. The computer would have to be very reliable and trusting for it to be valuable. The students these days is hard to tell because they just don't care anymore. If they don't care then there is no way to tell if they like something or not.

In the article it says ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is call and ""action unit."" In that paragraph its technically talking about how the computer will recognize facial expressions but in my opinion I feel like that would take alot of work for computer technicians to actually put more devices in a computer just to see what people think about them.

So in my opinion no I don't think they should use the technology to read emotions because it will make things more expensive and less people will buy them. Some people wouldn't like technology to read their emotions because alot of times people wont be angry at the computer they would be mad because the computer is trying to tell them how they are feeling.

8d7516b,"The author does not support the idea that studyng Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because he or she provides no explanation of facts stated and creates conflicting ideas that cast a grim shadow on travel to Venus.

First, the author doesn't support the idea effectively because he or she presents facts without explaining the significance or importance of them.

While describing why scientists consider visits to venus, the author states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in out solar system...The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable""(4).

By presenting that scientists want to visit Venus then almost immediately jumping to the weak conclusion that the ""value of returning to Venus seems indisputable"", the author fails to explain why the scientists want to visit Venus and why those reasons are important or significant.

Without an explanation of facts, writers leave the reader to create conclusions in their own minds, possibly without a complete understanding, weakening the authors support of his or her own claim or idea.

Second, the author doesn't support the idea effectively because he or she creates the picture in the reader's mind that successful and worthwhile travel to Venus is nearly impossible and certainly not attainable with today's technology.

While writing on what would be necessary for travel and observation of Venus, the author states ""a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions...[and be] survivable for humans.

However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions...[Also,] standard forms of photography...[would be] innefective...Therefore, sciendtists seeking to...understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks""(5).

By stating that ""a vehicle hovering over Venus"" would be safe for humans and then directly stating that it would not be enough and that scientists who want useful information would have to ""get up close and personal despite the risks"", the author states conflicting ideas.

In addition, earlier in the passage the author states ""On the planet's surgace, temperatures average over 800 degrees""(3).

This creates another serious flaw in the author's idea, because the conditions stated are not even close to survivable.

Combining the evidence presented by the author would point to the conclusion that astronomers would need to be using vehicles and photography equipment that currently don't exist and, even with unavailable technology, they must be willing to die to travel to Venus for study.

This creates the idea in the reader's head that studying Venus is impossible, which greatly weakens the author's claim.

All in all, impossibilities, conflicting ideas, and a lack of explanation of evidence crontribute to a weak argument in favor of the idea that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",5
ea743ff,"The technology is very valuable. It's actually quite amazing how something like that can pick up on peoples emotions. There so many ways that something like that could be very useful. Say such a teacher teaching in a college. It's hard to give all your attention to one student's confusion on something. It'd also be hard to be able to see if every student is paying attention and staying on task. But with this technology, it could help change that.

There are many ways that could change that, and that the fact is, it wouldnt take long for the computer to realize soemthing is wrong. A way it could help change that, is the teacher could easily switch on the topic he's speaking on. Most students when it's something they're not intersted in, seem to zone out and lose foucs. But if the teacher knew that most students felt that way, there's ways he could bring in something that they'd enjoy. Another way the computer could help is the teaching methods. It said in paragraph one, that they're wanting to make computre and human talking easier. One way is having a one one review, talk, or lesson. The Facial Action Coding System could easily pick up on when the student is lost or needs help.",2
66acffa,"Did aliens create an amazing masterpiece on Mars or are you just imagining that they did? Aliens surely do not exist or are for sure not on Mars. It is theretithized that aliens have formed or made an object that seems to look like a human face. I think that aliens didn't do it in many different ways. Such as, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Also, by using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of them. Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Just because we wonder about something, doesn't mean that it's really there.

First of all, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Different landforms that it resenmbles are rivers, volcanos, and mountains. This closely resembles the Snake River Plain in Idaho because of it's swirly indentions. Also in one of the pictures it looks as if it have hot boiling lava bubbling inside of it. And finally it shows high elevations such as the Rocky Mountains. This ""alien created object"" looks very similar to the many different landforms on Earth. This is one of the many reasons why it was not made by aliens but if there were any aliens wouldn't we have known about them by now?

Concequently, using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of the aliens if they lived on Mars. With all of the advanced technology that we have today you would've thought that our satelittes would've taken pictures of the aliens, right? Some reasons why we should've already seen aliens are that we have satelittes that can take high definition pictures, not only but also; we've launched many different programs towards Mars to take pictures but none of them have came back with positive results for aliens. And finally the rovers that we have sent to Mars have come back with little information about vital items needed to survive on a planet. With high definition pictures we can tell if there are any shelters, food, water, etc. on Mars, however there's not. Then again many different space progams hav launched satelittes to take pictures, but there is no vital signs. Finally the rocket propelled rovers that have landed on Mars have came back with little information about items needed to survive. There it is, another good reason and reality why aliens did not create this human looking landform, but it might've just been positioning why we thought that it looked human.

Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Different factors such as the position of the sun, clouds, and or temperature could've made this ""plain"" look human. The sun might've made the shadows of different hills look like eyes and a mouth. The clouds could've covered or angled the sun to make different shadows on the hilly area. Maybe the heat waves deformed the plateu to resemble a human. Nobody knows for sure and unless the exact same situation happens again we might find out, but until then I beleive that it is not possible that aliens made this landform.

It is possible that aliens exist and I don't doubt that they live without of our reach but I think that it is not possible for them to exist this close to us and we have not found out about it yet, therefore they are not real.

Everyone wonders what is beyond our reach, but just because you imagine it does that neccesarily mean that it is real? I think that all the examples like it looks like landforms on Earth, we should've seen picture of aliens, and many different factors might have effected our view are definitly reasons why aliens did not create this. Wondering and believing are both good things but if you don't focus on the truth of reality, you will not suceed.   ",5

Even though if the electors tie and then the peoples votes count it would be fair but we be able to fight for are country  at the age eighteen and be able to  vote but still not count is unfair because that would then be the boss of are country and are troops.

body: so me personally think this would be some great technology to have in our schools espically for consoulers so say someone is really sad and depressed but they are to scared to open up about how they feel or whats going so you put the computer on there face and it shows they are depressed sad and scared well now you know how your student is feeling so then you cheer them up and work to make things better you dont know it but you just saved a life because who knows weather or not that student was about to comit suicide or say someone was threatned and they will not tell you that so they act like there fine but you put the computer on them and it shows that they are scared now you know they are scared and can try to work with them to open up, but from other people perspectives i can totally see how this is a total invading of privacy because we all have secrects and we dont want people knowing if were depressed or sad and alot of people dont like to communicate or open with anyone and also what if things get passed around about you being depressed the generatin today are bullys so i can see someone making fun of someone for being depressed.

conclusion: inconclusion i think it would be some great technology to have in our schools just think about how many lives we can change or how many lives we can save by just knowing how the person next to you is feeling it would save a lot of time trying to get the person to tell you whats wrong when you can just take a picture of there face so yes i do think it would be great because itll make life better, you would save more time, and you could change alot of lives and save alot of lives with this type of technology.",3
bd6f56e,"There is absolutely no way that the ""face"" on Mars was made by aliens. Some people and very few scientists think this landform was made by aliens on Mars. When you think about it,it is not logical. If there were aliens on Mars scientists and NASA would of known about them by now and would of informed us. They have up to date technology now and would of detected a living thing on Mars if there was anything there,which there isn't.

Some people say that NASA and scientists are trying to keep the aliens a secret and keep them from us but there is no reason to. I think if there were aliens on Mars they would of let us know because it would be a bigger benefit for them because people would want to see them and pictures of them. They could get a lot of money so it doesn't make sense for them to hide them from us. Also the ""face"" became a priority to them and they took many photos and did a lot of research about it. The most logical answer is that the ""face"" is just a natural landform or rock formation made by nature. The eyes,nose,and mouth are formed by clouds that give an illusion.""What the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa,lanforms common around the American West,"". It is a coincidence that is resembles a face but that doesn't mean it was made by aliens.

There is no reason for people not to believe scientists or NASA because there is no evdience that the ""face"" was made by aliens or that NASA and the scientists are lying to us. Everything about it is not logical and does not make sense,if there were any actual life on Mars we would of know by now. It is just a rock formation and shadows that is tricking the human eye.",3
7bcd2de,"Driverless cars are becoming a reality, rather than a dream. Google has been using them to create their 3-D maps around the globe, and now they are allowed in certain states of the U.S. Most have a very low collision rate, and could be handy in many situations. But even though they are an invention and are useful in some ways, there are too many legal things that could go wrong for them to be worthwhile. If a car crashes, is it the owner's fault or the car manufacturer? Will it make people rely even more on computers? Driverless cars, although a very useful invention for some purposes, will not catch on because of the legal issues that would follow, depenicey on computers that could fault to error, and the rewriting of driving laws and an education to even learn how to work with the autonomonus vehicle.

When you get into an accident with your car, usually it can fall under two catagories: your fault with driving, or the conditions of the outside and the built of the car. For a drastic example, if somebody was not paying attention to the road, rather a phone, and winds up headfirst into a tree, that does not require the car manufacturer to intervene because it was the driver's fault. Opposing, if there is a recall in the anti-lock break system and it causes a person to crash, that is more at fault with the car company, as their breaks were not up to standards and safety regulations. But with the idea of driverless cars becoming a reality, the line between the person and the manufacturer is blurred. If the car was driving itself and for some reason gets into an accident, is it the owner's fault, even if they couldn't control it? Or is the car manufacturer's fault, even if they had installed a sensor so that the person could take over? This arguement could lead to a lot of trials and conflicts over the legality of the car, and compared with other events happening, it would become more of a problem rather than a positive, causing legal battles and controversy over the car.

With the generation coming in of kids who have lived through the start of modern technology and social media, the baby-boomers and so on have a lot to say about the issue of modern technology. Many say it is a waste of time, and is teaching the new generations to be lazier, while it doesn't rather apply to social media and the interenet, as it has made a wonderful contribution to the global network, it can be argued that a driverless car while the driver sits and waits is rather lazy. But the bigger issue is the dependency on the computer; computers get hacked, glitchy, and tricky as it is, and it is rather unsettling to think the computer running your car, which holds your life, can screw up and change your life entirely. It is more settling if there were the mentioned lights and buzzers to let us know what is going on. ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger... Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays."" (7). Even though those forementioned signals are being in place, what if they are not working as well? Even though that might be a small chance of it happening, it is always a risk. To rely on a computer with your own life in the situation that you could use an actual car is quite unsettling, and even if it is safe at first, can always lead to accidents and glitches.

With the rise of the autonomous car, many precautions and risks are in place.

The chance of a legal battle with a car manufauctuer, and the idea of the computer glitching at the wheel are just two details about why the idea of an autonomous car would be more of a negative than a positive. The invention and ideas behind it are very well-supported and used well today, the reality is that it won't catch on to become mainstream. There are too many what-if's that if brought up, would make the general market iffy on letting go of the wheel.",5
5d7c618,"Intro-The technology would be valuable because it would allow students to focus on their assingments. This technology could keep students on task and allow for them to have a learning environment that they could thirve in. This technology could also create a better world in general by enhancing the future generations knowledge.

Body 1-Technolgy has become a everyday thing in our lives and has created many distractions for students. With this new technology students could continue focusing on what's important, their school work. This would make students grades improve and allow them to have a better oppurtunity in the real world. Occording to the text, the technology would also allow ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This means the technology could adjust itself to learn how the student works, instead of the other way around. Also ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" meaning that the technology would work for each student around the world.

Body 2- This technology would also create a better living environment across the globe. This is because computers could explain lessons to students in ways a human couldn't. The computer could analzye the students face, see any confusion, and change the lesson plan into what the individual student needs. This is all plausible because the text omits that the technology ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This could make jobs easier for teachers, and increase the future generations knowledge by teaching them more than a human could.

Conclusion- This technology could seriosly improve schools for the better and allow them to forever change how we learn. Students could be individually taught, and they would always learn because the computer would still know if the student is confused or not.

Cons of the driverless cars are common sense you will nees a whole lot of sensors which cost a whole lot of money. The driver would still need to be on alert the whole time while driving. Another thing is what if the car just glitchs and there is not enough time for myself to stop. New laws will be coming some will be changing in case of an accident. What if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is a fault the driver or the manufacturer is the question.

In conclusion this is my opinion and my position on ""Diverless Cars Are Coming"". I just feel like it is a dangerest issue that the world does not need to worry about.     ",2
5f23fdb,"I personally am all for the driverless cars idea. Through time, everything has evolved and is still eveolving to newer and better ideas of the original. For example, we started with little shacks, now we have skyscrapers, we rode horses now we have cars, we had mail, now we have email or texting, the point I am trying to make is everything needs to evolve for us to improve anything. Technology is a big part of our lives today and we rely on it for most of anything and everything.

Every year we have thousands maybe millions of deaths and injuries resulting from car crashes, the fact of the matter is, people are irresponsible and reckless. We have drunk driving, texting and driving, and simply just not paying attention that causes all these wrecks and I believe that driverless cars could solve all these problems and save a lot of lives.

Driverless cars could also solve other problems such as gas prices. In the story it mentions that driverless cars use half the amount of gas as taxis do and they are way more efficient. People could have a lot more money spending half the amount of money they usually do on gas. Do you know how much money people spend on gas? A lot. So these are the reasons that I am all for driverless cars, it's the next big thing, why would we say no to that?  ",3
699ce8c,"Driverless cars seem like a neat and fun idea but they are not as great as they seem. Driverless cars can be dangerous and are not more efficient then a normal car. These cars seem to have many good things about them but actually have plenty of negative effects. The diverless cars ahould not be developed.

Driverless cars are not practical because the cars are not 100% driverless. The driverless cars can only be alone in 25 mph conditions. The car also can not be alone in traffic or near construction. As stated in paragraph 7 ""the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" The human in the car can not even relax while the car drives itself because he/she must still watch the road and be ready to drive when the car can not. Then the driver will be nervous waiting for their turn to drive when it is time. The driver will just feel much more stressed. Is it not better for the driver to just drive at all times and avoid stress about getting on the wheel on time?

Some might say that the driverless cars are great because you are much safer in them. These cars have a lot of new and smart technology that helps in making a car trip much safer for the driver and its passengers. Also it alows the driver to multitask while the car drives. Drivers can be on their phones or finish up their hair and/or makeup. When the driver is in a tough situation they can just let their cars get through it and take back the wheel whenever he/she is ready..

The driverless cars are not as safe as they seem with all its technology. The number one reason people get into car crashes is because they were distracted ,usally by their phones and encouriging drivers to be on their phones in a ""driverless "" car is very dangerous. With these new cars it will be very hard to try and even multitask. Since they are not self-efficient the driver must pay attention to the road at all times ,therefore making it very hard to safetly turn around and do something else. Drivers when trying to do something ,in a hurry will have to leave what they are doing to attend to the wheel when the car can no longer drive. Since the car will only be able to drive in specific conditions the driver must attend to the wheel constantly.

The driverless cars are in fact not so ""driverless"" and beat their own and only purpose. These cars have many negative sides to them and should definitely not take the place of normal and safe cars. Driverless cars should not be developed by car manufacturers!",4
c4d0651,"The author says that studies Venus would be beneficial to the world. He says this because Venus is sometimes the closest planet to us and would give us insight to other planets outside our solar system. We could learn about how water works on planets and if Venus ever hosted life. If Venus did at one point have life on its surface that would be the greatest discovery ever made. Next is how we would explore Venus.

If we were to explore Venus NASA would allow scientists to float above the roiling Venusian landscape by having you in a blimp like vehicle above 30 miles. We already know the Venus has had oceans in the past. We know this because of the valleys, mountain, and craters. The valleys are by the oceans Venus had. The mountains are caused by the movement of tectonic plates, and the craters are caused by space debris and asteroids hitting Venus. Furthermore is the life that could have been on Venus in it's oceans.

Now if there was life on Venus that would be the biggest discovery of mankind. There was definatly a possibility of life on Venus in the oceans. Basic life was found on Earth as far back as almost 3 billion years ago, that would have been a good time for Venus to support life on its surface as well. The surface of Venus is so inhospitable now that spacecrafts sent to study Venus haven't survived for more than a few hours. That's because of the atmosphere of Venus which ia almost 97 percent carbon dioxcide. The pressure of Venus is higher than the pressure in the deepest parts of our oceans.

In conclusion, Venus is a really good place to research despite the dangers. We could find life outside Earth for the first time on Venus. NASA has offered a way for scientists to research Venus by putting them into a blimp like vehicle that would be hovering at around 30 miles high. THe only danger is the pressure but in that vehicle NASA would provide it would be like a submarine in our oceans. That is why and how the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.   ",2
aca3239,"We humans have been trying to discover aliens for more than a million years. Why have we not found them yet? We have been up in space multiple times and we have had yet another more multipe times sent space robots that went into orbital. So ask your self this question why have we not found aliens yet?

I think due to evidence that it is a natural landform. I think it is a natural landform because in paragraph one it states that ""...when it spotted the shadowly likeness of a human face."" When I read this I then concluded that it only really looked like a human because of the shadows that make up the ""eyes, nose and mouth"" in which makes this rock figure looking as if it has a face. I do think that is a natural rock landform because God created the earth so that only people would live on earth. Also God never created aliens as it states in the begining of Genisis in the bible. Another example of why that the ""face"" on Mars is a natural landform is because it states in the text on paragraph seven that ""There was no alien monument after all."" This is poroving that even scienctists have conculuded that there was no landform on mars. Then on April 8, 2001 the space station found to ""face landform"". Though due to the pixalation i think that it did not look like a face anymore. The scientists should have put each photo in the same pixilation because it would have been an accurate demonstration over the years and how this rock landform has formed.

Based on the evidence from the article and my past knowleadge I have conculded that this rock landform is in fact a natural landform that aliens have not created/ made this face looking landform. So what do you think?",3
8159b69,"Do you think aliens are real? If they are can they make landforms and make them look natural? IN 1976 NASA captured a photo on Mars that looked like a face. Some people thin that aliens made the face. I know that the face is not made by aleins and is a natural landform. The reasons I know this is because there are things like this that happen on Earth. Also NASA says that the face was only shawdos that made it look like a face and they also sent other ships with better cameras to take pictures.

First is that things like this happen on Earth too. The Grand Canyon was a natural thing that happened. Landfroms are common in the west U.S. Rock formations hapen everywhere on earth. Also NASA says this is the equivalent to a mesa. People still did not belive it was natural.

Another reason I know this is natural is because NASA says that the eyes, nose, and, mouth where only shawdos and where not there. People still belived that is was aleins. NASA sent another space ship up to mars to take pictures. So they sent the Mars Global Surveyor up. It can takes picture up to 10 times better than the Viking 1.

Last is the Mars Globoal Surveyor. It flew over cydonia and snapped a photo that was 10 times better than the Viking 1. In the photo you can see that it is only a rock formation. Also in the photo you can see it has not dark spots that where the eyes,nose,and mouth as you can see in the Viking photo. You can still see a what appears to be a mouth in he rock though. In 2001 the MGS took a photo and it has no markings that llok like a face.

In conclusion the face on Mars was proven wrong by Nasa's Mgs. The face is not real and it was only a formation with shadows.Aliens did not make the face. With better technology you can see that the face is not there and aleins did not make it.",3
7630d04,"The author thinks that people should not stop what there doing because something is dangerous and has risks. The author thinks that venus should still be studied so we can find out why its like the way it is and see if anything is on the planet. The author wants people to keep studying despite the dangers and risks.

The author talks about how scientist are trying to make things that can make it to venus and say on the planet for a while and come back. They were thinking of making a giant blimp-like spacecraft that could fly 30 miles over venus and they couls study the planet from there. They could also make a simplified electronics that are made of silicon carbide. They are wrking on ays to continue studying venus.

I agree with the author, people should not stop studying it because of the dangers and the risks. They should continue to study it so they can find out if there is anything knw about the planet that we dont know.

Now why in the world would they make driveless cars? Can anybody answer that for me cause i want to know and i want to know now.They cant even figure out what should help the car drive by its self.So WHY? WHY? and WHY?

I got so many questions and one of them is.What would this car look like?Would it look like an old fashion car? Would it look like one of the cars from recent years.Or would it just look like a disfromed car.They say they got to put this and that in the car so to me it seems like the car is going to be a weird shaped car.Thats my opinion an dimma stick to it.

Now is this car safe?Cause to me they dont know what it is.They say it could be accidents and all that nonsense that i dont want to hear.So why would I MyKale want to waste money on a car that i cant controll and that i might get

into an accudent with.Cause I would never ever want to waste that much money on garbage cause theres no reason to.These car sthese day sare safe and i know all this.I know im not bout to to get in no reck and brake anything.Because from my knowledge i know these regular cars now days is safe and are under my controll.I can controll the car the car does not controll me.

A driverless car.Now like i said why would they make a such thing like that.What was going through they heads when they thought about it.Or did they even think on it.Cause to me they didnt.Cause i would never think of an diverless car.Its just too much to think about to much to figure out and how much is going to be in the car how is it going ot run.How fast will it go.How far until you got to take control.

If you going to make a diverless car nobody should be putting their hands on anything.To me we could be concentrated on our phones or doing some other stuff.But instead we got to pay attention the whole time just incase we got to put our hands on the steering wheel.But NO! i dont want to put my hands on nothing if yall want to make a diverless car make sure yall do it right to where my hands dont have to go on nothing.Its a diverless car right well get it together.

We shouldnt have to look at the road the whole time.We should be able to do something and look up and not be in a car reck.The car suppose to be protecting us and steering us to our destinnation.And making sure we get there on time.If the car got to go an certain speed and it makes me late.Im burning that car down for good.Driverless car shouldnt be making nobody late.Cause if so we can just buy a regular car and call it a day.

So to me this Driverless Car is pointless it shouldnt never been in they heads.Theres no safety no nothing.I just dont understand the concept of the vehicle.So me MyKale is not on the list of buying a DRIVERLESS CAR!",3

7c16669,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to know exactly what your friend is feeling 24/7? Well, now you can be somewhat omnscient and know exactly what their emotions are. Isn't that neat?

I believe that the use of FACS, Facial Action Coding System, woud be very helpful and advantageous in the classroom setting. For instance, if you were teaching a complex Calculus lesson, wouldn't you want to know if your students were comprehending your lesson? Dr. Huang of the University of Illinois predicts, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming cofused or bored. Then, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

This newly developed technology can also be applied outside of the classroom. Some examples of the numerous applications are internet advertisements and video games. The article also states that FACS could make computer-generated faces more lifelike, like in video games and video surgery.

Of course, this technology has its disadvantages. For instance, some people would argue that this technology is, in fact, an invasion of privacy because no one should know what you're feeling every single hour of the day.

Also, this technology is a new innovation, and the article states that your home PC wouldn't be able to process the complex algorithms FACS uses. If a home PC can't handle, how do we know a computer at school can?

All in all, I strongly believe the use of FACS in a school setting would be highly beneficial. Even with its disadvantages, FACS will be usefule in school institutions.

If it makes math easier to learn, why wouldn't we use it? ",3
0c09020,"You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. The program will allow you to experience many different adventures and go to many unique and eccentric places. One time my friend, Don Reist, and I went to New Orleans after the Pacific War had ended. We boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, and we headed to Greece with the cargo of 335 horses with enough oats and hay to feed them. That was my first order, and I had fun.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, such as myself. Besides getting to help others, I had the side benefit of getting to see Europe and China. When I first went to Greece, I saw the Acropolis. I had also toured an excavated castle in Crete, and I marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. See, there are many adventures you can take on side of joining the Seagoing Cowboys program.

One time when I was going to China, it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings always kept me busy. The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Stalls had to be cleaned. Luckily for me, helping my aunt Katie out on her farm as a boy had prepared me for hard work, just not for the dangers of the sea. As another example, if you had the experience I did of helping on the farm you have been slightly prepared with hard work.

One dark rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as I shot my feet torward an opening on side of the ship. The only thing keeping me from falling overboard into the deep, dark, and dangerous Atlantic Ocean was a small strip of metal along the edge. I was really happy to still be alive. But, I couldn't work for a couple of days because of some cracked ribs. I'll admit it, there some dangers working as a Seagoing Cowboy. But, the people there really look after you, and they care about you.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. Participating in the program opened up a whole new world for me. I am really grateful for the opportunity. The program helped make me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. That awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.                 ",4
a784f51,"Ever scence the invintion of cars people have been making advancements and modifications all to revolutionize them and make them better than the last model. Well what if I told you that the next model you buy might even drive itself? With todays technology self driving cars are no longer just the fantasy of a persons imagination. Self driving cars exist right now in fact google has had self driving cars scence 2009. Don't get the wrong idea however, the self driving cars have a ways to go before they hit the streets of America.

Cars that drive without the use of humans will have a much bigger impact than just not having to remotly drive it. A resurcher named Sergey Brin envisions a future with fleets of self driving cars transporting the public. Humans will no longer need to buy cars wich could save a lot of money for ordanary people who dont have alot of it. With less human driven cars Sergey foresees that the fuel used will be half of what is used today. That will have a huge impact on our environment and natural resources. Having to import less fuel means that America can spend that big chunk of money some were else.

The self driving cars of the future will be equiped with the latiest and greatiest technology. Todays cars already have radars that can stop your car from backing up into an object or even emergancy stop for you. Motion sensors can now beam lasers that form a constantly updating 3D model of the cars surroundings. A self driving car could use those 3D images to know when there is on coming trafic, See road blocks up ahead and even stop if a deer were to run out into the road.

Some people do not like the idea of a self driving car because it takes the controle out of there own hands. The Self driving cars that are currantly in use right now still give the driver controle over the vehicle. The cars even need some human help. The cars have been equiped to tell the driver to take over when human help is requred. Some cars will have a vibrating seat or flash light on the wind shield, or the car might even just tell you to take over.

Over all a self driving car in my opinion would be a helpfull thing. Once all the bugs are worked out and proper laws are made total human controled cars will be a thing of the past.",4
320f4d3,"Dear, State sentaor

Juding by this artical ""Does the Electoral College Work?"",  readers would agree that electoral colleges should be changed. This artical explains what electoral colleges are, how they help voting, and how they are bad. These three things give the reader the opion about this artical.

Source one ""What is the Electoral College Work? "" by the Office of the Federal Register explains what an electoral college is "" The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"". The founding fathers intended to help with elections but later people want it to go away so their votes matter.

Since electoral colleges have been formed they have been disliked because they are thought of as ""an anachronism, and a non-democratic method of selecting a president"". Another is ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". In most of the passage it talks about how the readers demise the electoral college.

To sum up this passage the readers would agree electoral colleges are unwanted, and not need. This is supported by many quotes in all of the sources. The best quote to prove this point is "" Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense ... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.                                                                                  ",3
12e8e0b,"I am in favor of chaging to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Your vote would contribute to a president even greater than an Electoral Vote. Also, it provides a ""voice"" for a citizen.

In an election by popular vote my vote would make a difference because it is considered its own vote. When you in an Electoral College your vote is only a contribution. In Source 2:

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong it says, ""each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" This is one way to make you vote worth less than full vote.

Some believe that their vote won't make a differnece. The reality is that their vote wouldn't potentially assist their candidate towards winning the election as much as your own standing vote. In Source 3:

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President it is said, ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote ...."" And in a popular vote it provides you your ""voice"".

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced with election by popular vote. The Electoral College makes your vote less of a vote. In an election by popular vote your vote would mean more. And you will be able to have your ""voice"" to say that you voted for the candidate you wanted.    ",3
df3c776,"Car, bikes, walking and such are many forms of transportation. Cars are the main favorite overall. But as time continues we see that the drastic need for cars is growing smaller and smaller because we are now seeing the bigger picture; limiting car usage is a bigger plus than a negative.

In Vauban,German the surburb is going ""car-free"". Rosenthal speaks about how Vauban allows cars but there are only two locations where they may park these cars. If you want to park your car you must buy a space for $40,000, and a home along with your parking space. Due to these facts 70% of Vauban families do not own a car. An advantage of this limited car usage is that people like Heidrum Walter speak about how she is much happier and less tense without her car.

Vauban is in an area that is more accesible to public transportation and closer to stores.  The closeness allows people easier accessablity to buses, or walking and biking places.  With everything close its easier to get to point A to B. Also reduces pollution and greenhouse gases due to the fact they aren't using cars to get to there locations.

In Source 2 Duffer, speaks about how in Paris bans are being placed against the usage against cars, due to the fact Paris has a high level of smog. Paris had motorists with even-numbered license plates on Mondays leave there cars home or suffer a fine. On Tuesday motorists with odd-numbered license plates were to leave cars home or suffer a fine. The advantage of this ban is that having so many people leave there cars home on Monday allowed the smog to clear enough that the ban for Tuesday was rescind. If Paris were to do this ban for a couple of years there smog issue would be completely gone. This would be a major advantage for them, it would give them less pollution, not as many people getting sick due to the smog, and a less car dependent city.

An event was created in Bogota, Colombia called A Day Without Cars. Which was to have people go car-free for a day. Colombians used many other transportations such as biking, buses, and hiking. This event allowed smog to be reduced due to the fact Colombians could not use a car this day or be fined. Also this event helped spark other areas want to pertake in this event. This was a huge advantage having many other places join A Day Without Cars; this meant more areas helping reduce smog and helping many more areas become aware of the fact cars dont have to be the only form of transportation people use.

All in all if areas become less car dependent, there shall be less smog, pollutions and lastly people wont have to travel as far due to the fact everything will be closer. The smaller amount of cars we have, the more positive outcomes.             ",4
dd4c541,"Facial Action Coding System is a potential and valuable way to read students' emotions while in class. Through the use of this technology, it could bring forth various opportunites. The system could open doors to the genuine thoughts of students to let adults better understand a view into their minds . Utilizing this technology will illustrate a positive change to the school by giving instructors insight to a students mental health, engagment with certain topics, and learning style.

The mental health of a student is a vital piece of information that a teacher should know. In the text, the author states that, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication...So computers need to understand that too"" (Alto 6). By writing this, he conveys to readers that the software can process your emotions. Therefore, if a student demonstrates a pattern of unhappy emotion, an administrator can then speak to the student and find out what might be going on in their home life or if they need to see a counselor. If a computer could give insight to happy or sad emotions, what other emotions could it detect?

The knowledge of how a student learns or the level of engagment they have within the classroom is a key component to modifying lessons and ensuring the most enriching education for a certain individual. Within the article, Alto inserts a quote from Thomas Huang, a professor, in which he says, ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (Alto 6). This means that opportuinities for a student to get a more indivualized education increase, and teachers will have the ability to revise lessons in order to adjust to level of understanding majority of students have. It would also create a tremendous chance for the students who are falling below average to be identified and recieve the propering tutoring needed. Would these new adjustments then lead to a better understanding of learning styles?

Each individual in a classroom has a unique way of learning that requires attention and adaption on the lesson in order to fully let the student reach their potential to excell with their education. The author claims that the technology could, ""...modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Alto 6). This gives the information that the system could be able to analyze the way students learn, and give access to various learning styles of their student. This would enable them to then adhere to the students education needs, and therefore open doors to make break throughs with children that had been struggling.

There are many factors to consider when contemplating the use of this technology in the classroom. Although, the overall result of putting this system in place would be positive. The ability to detect students emotions will enable instructors to teach more attentively to each indivdual student, causing the childs achievement level to rise snd their education to strengthen. Enriching education and making it personal to the student will in time increase passing test scores, the number of college graduates, and literacy rate. Schools should consider encorperating the FACS technology in order to obtain a brighter, better future for their kids and country. ",5
3a27c7e,"Imagine having a teacher that always helps you because they know how you feel about the class. Well this dream might not be too far away because prefessor Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, and his colleagues have made software that can precisely calculate human emotions. This technology can be especially beneficial to us students because it conveys our exact feelings and emotions to our teachers who can then help us and give us feedback on the material. This new breakthrough in technology could mean massive changes in modern education.

As Dr. Huang coherantly demonstrates, there is no reason to doubt that computers can accurately read your emotions. People say things like ""Computers will never know feeling"" or ""Emotions aren't just ones and zeros"" but the facts hold true, this new mathmatically based software is both trustworthy and accurate. This new technology is a game changer because as Dr. Huang says,

""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" (Huang) and to students that might be shy or not clear when they talk, this means that they will be heard. This means that nobody is left to figure it out on their own.

As we all know, there are some teachers that are not the best. But with Dr. Huang's new software, every classroom could be at maximum efficiency. Dr. Huang ensures us that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and that this would cause immediate action because it would then ""Modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Huang). The time of students suffering through class is over, personalized lesson planning is in.

As you reflect on this article, try to imagine how easy it would be to communicate with your teachers if they could read your emotions. New technology is the future of the classroom and as shown, it can be more than beneficial to both teachers and students when it comes to conveying emotions. Nobody should have to make a big effort to tell someone how they feel, and nobody should be left behind because their teacher can't understand what they are trying to tell them.",4

Lastly the author proves her argument rigt because he/she presents a challange at the end of the article that makes you want to take action. The author says, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginaton and innvoation."" This is the last sentence of the article and the writer did a very nice job using it as a challenge to face and a call-to-action. This sentence will make reasearchers accept the challenge, which will prover her argument correct.

Overall, the author did an excellent job of presenting the argument and being able to support it with different types of evidence and even a challenge. The method he/she used was very effetive and proved a point very well.      ",4
01d2df1,"The Future of Driverless Cars

Could you think about yourself not having to worry about driving your car anymore? This is becoming a possibility with all the new technology automobile companies are using to make this happen. But, there are some people that are opposed to this idea becasue of some problems that could come from this This idea also has a majority of supporters too which myself is one of them. There is some bad things about it dealing with traffic and accidents but there is stress relief for not having to drive and not worrying about the road. Also you would be able to do whatever you want while the car is driving to your destination.

I support the idea of the self driving car for many reasons that will soon help all drivers. ""The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" With the cars technology ability to be able to mimic the human driver is a huge factor for self driving because it can do all the driving that a human does normally. Some people especially hate driving because it casues them stress and anger so I think if every car was self driving there would be no problems, no traffic, and no accidents to worry about. ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This quote is talking about how only few states let companies test autonomous cars which hinders the developement of the cars and their safety for all of us because how can you make a better car if you cant test in in real situations. This is a problem with the testing becaus ethe car cant become better and solve the problems if there is not testing done.

On the other hand of the argument there is many things still wrong with the cars and their saftey. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a big problem witht he cars because technology usually fails at some points in time and if this causes a big accident and people are hurt it will cause so much frustration and confusion on everyone invloved. Another point about the problems of the car is ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" The quote has a big meaning because whats the point of having self driving cars that you need to worry about while its driving? ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" The whole point of the self driving cars is its ability to be able to do these things so it should be able to switch could be developed later on.

So in conclusion the self driving cars in my perspective are a good idea but it will come with soem complications as does everythign else. This would be a huge step for the human race and would benefit alot of people. The technology will grow and the problems will become less until we have reached the point where there is no problems with the cars and their abilities.      ",4
99e37ba,"Dear state senator I feel like we do not need to keep the Electoal College and we need to change the election to popular vote. Even Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on abolishing the Electoral College and I agree with them. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. Most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown in the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote for the vice president. The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. It's offical the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best known arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. It's ghard to say this but Bob Dole was right, we should abolish the electoral college.

The electoral college is a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocate of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense, it is the electors that elect the president, not the people. when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidates share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.    ",2
3a05703,"Some people think that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens. Yes I can see what perspective they're comming from because the ""Face on Mars"" was up in space and space isnt just like a place here or there its our galaxy. Who knows what's going on up there everyday? Many people, even scientists believe that the ""Face of Mars"" was indeed infact created by aliens.

Then there was this article about the ""Face on Mars"" it was called, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". It stated that many people had the thought that aliens did in fact create the ""Face of Mars"" and NASA even had scientists go on a mission to unravel the truth about the ""Face on Mars"" with evidence. It stated exactly from the article, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Yes that is great that they were concluding the fact that maybe perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze but they're not sure it was just an assumption. But around April 5,1998 it stated from the article that, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" That is evidence that the ""Face on Mars"" was in fact a landform.

In conclution many people still think that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens. NASA even had special missions for the curiousity with the planet and its Face. Many evidence was found through those missions and concluded that it was a landform. Even though many assumed that the "" Face on Mars"" was created by aliens, an image on the JPL website reveals evidence of a natural landform of the ""Face of Mars"".",3
0467e2a,"Life without cars may seem like a distant dream, but dreams are becoming a reality with new expiremental towns,  banning of driving in some cities, and a national day without cars. Cars are causing, in some cases, more and more pollution everywhere. Although we ignore the signs of pollution everyday, we must face the fact that we are polluting our planet, and something needs to be done about it.

Vauban, Germany. A little city that has a strange law, to live in this city, you must give up your car or pay $40,000 to park it. As a result, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move here"" stated Source 1. Heidrun Walter, a mother of two and a media trainer stated, ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"".  This new form of seperate suburban life from auto use is called ""Smart Planning"".  passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissionsin Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States.  With Smart Planning, we can cut back on greenhouse gasses and start to breathe cleaner, healthier air.

Another example of over pollution problems due to cars is Paris, France. Source Two states, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"".  Congestion was down 60 percent for those five days. The reason there was so much smog in the air was due to the diesel fuel. Diesel fuel is the mail fuel used in France, 67 percent of the people there use it.  Another factor could be the climate there. With ""cold nights and warm days caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" Stated in Source Two.

Europe isn't the only continent seeing change. Bogota, Colombia was celebrating its 3rd straight year of, Day Without Cars. The Day Without Cars is a banning of cars and only busses and taxis are permitted.  Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". For the first time this year, two more Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar are taking part in this Day Without Cars.

America too is seeing change with cars.  The number of miles driven in the US peaked in 2005, but has been steadily dropping after. As of April 2013, 'the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the county was in January 1995"", states Source four.  Although the drop in car usage will have a benificial effect on the environment, it will have negitave implications for car industries.  Ford and Mercedes are already taking steps to rebrand themselves to ""mobility"" companies.  Although car companies aren't the only ones changing their ways due to the drop in car usage.  New York started a new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing.  They have started building more bike paths and tunnel tolls are reflecting the new priorities.

Cars have done enough damage to this earth and its time we fix what we have caused. With all these new eco-friendly and car lacking ideas, we are so close to the isea where we can live without cars taking over our life.    ",4
ed42697,"Driverless cars would be a good aspect to our world. It would be a great experience for poeple all around the world to try. Google cofounders are already envisioning the future car and are trying to create them as soon as posibly.

First off, driverless cars would be a good aspect to our world because there is no cars out that is driverless. In the article it says, "" In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" That states that Google cofounders need to make and test there driverless cars until its 100% driverless.

Secondly, bringing driverless cars to the world would be a great experience for poeple to try while being safe.

This states that car will alarm person when need to take control over the wheel.

1cd6fae,"Based on what I have read o do not think self riving cars should be allowed. The law is right based on what they say these cars eventhough they have sensos to make the driver aware of situations in need of a human. The person in the car may become to focused on what they are doing and ignore the sensor. The idea of self driven cars is too risky. Even though they are going for safety a car cant drive like a human or have the response time of a human and even computers make mistakes.

Even in a simple GPS they tend to make mistakes often. So what happens if the cars GPS is off on its calculations and the car drives through a house. Will they blame that on the driver. I would hope not. It shouldnt be the drivers mistake if the car messes up. You cant always rely on computers.

So no I highly disagree with this. Computers arent perfect, and there are just some things only humans can do. Driving might just be one of those things. What these people are visualizing are just things they have seen on t. v that does not mean it will happen the same as it does on t. v.",3
6bd6591,"Venus, other wise known as Earth's sister planet. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" they talk about may parts of Venus good and bad. Home to alot of hostile enviroments such as a 97% carbon dioxide atmosphere and temperatures at around 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Believe it or not though, Venus could have been like earth many years ago. With similar geographical features like mountians, vallys and craters, may suggest that life could have lived there. The author say that it would be worth our time to study Venus despite its dangers. The author does a very good job supporting this quote by saying how we can study it and why we should study it.

Venus has a atmosphere that is very hot and acidic. With sulfuric acid strong enough to melt your phone from your hands, none of the robots we have sent have ever made it back. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) may have a solution to these enviotments that may help us get some more information on Venus despite its hostility. Which makes for a why for how we could study the planet. In the text it states, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"" (Paragraph 5). Even though the tempaturese at this altitude would be still 170 degrees Fahrenheit, the atmosphere pressure would be normal, and we would have solar power. Then we could study the landscape of the planet more and we could learn more about the enviorment. With this knowledge, Venus would be worthy to study even though it have dangerous conditions.

Another way we could study the planet is with new and old tecnology. It says that if we used the computers we use today which are fast and powerful, then we could risk them getting damaged or lost becuase of how delicate they are. NASA has though of another solution to this problem too. Insted of using these comupters, why not use the mehanical computer. In the text it says, ""By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" (Paragraph 7). This way, we could use the computers to find out much more about the planet then just what it looks like too. We could study the mass of the planet, what it is made of, and so on. Which proves that studying venus is worth it.

Even with some of these things support his idea of studying the planet, he does take away from his idea. The text states, ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface tempature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun"" (Paragraph 3). This take away from the idea that we should study it. This thought makes it seem overwhelming to go and study Venus. They do a nice job recovering by using NASA's idea of a ""blimp-like structure"" to take care of some of the heat issue. He also supports his idea by clearly stating that this would make the planet easy to study.

Venus, the Roman God of love, may not seem so kind on the looks of the planet, but with the new ideas scientists are coming up with and the testing that NASA is doing, the idea of a closer study of Venus might not be so far after all. Even though we've been presented with the struggles of the planets hostile enviorment, we as humans have been intrigued with the planet and won't stop untill we know the planet. We have the ideas of how to study it and why we should, we just need to do it. These, as stated from the author, are the reasons we should should study Venus.",5
94e7de9,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smiles,"" the author tells us how this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System allows computers to recognize human emotions. For many that would be shocking and interesting. This news has certainly peaked my interest. This new technology could be a major breakthough in many cases. The author gave us many examples to go off of but their are so many more. I believe that this Facial Action Coding System can be used for good when it comes to internal or personal problems, helping to improve students learning process', and to improve the overall way we communicate with our computer.

This new technology as I hope, can be used to solve many issues. When it comes to internal or personal issues or problems that occur, it can be quite stressful or upsetting some times. We could use this technology to read the emotions of a student and identify the changes in there mood. This technology, as Dr. Eckman said in the passage, can detect happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Suppose a student's family member was in a car accident. This technology could identify that something wrong has happened by the sadness on the student's face. Suppose a student suffers from depression. We could code these computers to not only identy emotions but again, alert to us that something is wrong. This, in turn, allows the student to get proper treatment and help.

Another way that this new technology could help, as Dr. Huang stated, is if it could recognize when a student becomes bored or confused. This is a sure fire way to help thousands, if not millions of students stay focused in school and learn. When the program recognizes the students boredom or agitation or confusion, it could make things simpler or change the way they are learning to best keep them entertained and on board. A lot of students in my very own school are hit with such boredom that they doze off in class. With this new technology that can change.

Have you ever had times where you got frustrated because your computer wouldn't cooperate or do the right thing you requested? I sure have and it is quite often. This Facial Action Coding System could help in those situations as well. If more emotions are put into this system it could detect and find a way to change those emotions if negative. They have technology where you can command your computer or device with your voice, but sometimes that does not work either. This new technology combined with the voice commands could help us communicate or requests and objectives clearly so the computer can understand. Although our devices may not be flesh and blood, they do indeed have brains. Uncapable of many things, but never the less it has a control center. We could better communicate with our devices through this new technology.

This technology, like I have described, can have many good and positive uses. I'm sure you could come up with many just as well as the rest of us. As technology advances we learn to accept it and adapt to it. We use it in everyday life. As you can see, I believe this technology could improve humanity and student's lives by identifying problems and finding ways to fix them, improve learning process', and better our communication with computers and such devices.",5
a5ba699,"Driverless cars are a smart idea in my opinion. There are multiple benefits of having a driverless car, and even though there are disadvantages as well, the pros out weigh the cons in this case. The inventors of these types are cars are extremely bright people and know what they are doing. There have been studies shown how beneficial driverless cars can be and I agree with them.

The next new thing in technology car wise would be a driverless car. Sebastian Thrun said that it would not have been possible to make something this interesting before 2000 because we did not possess the equipment and tools we needed to accomplish much. However, as time has gone on and technology has become better, we are able to make driverless cars now. The people that are working on the driverless cars are making them as safe as possible. The cars contain many sensors to warn the driver when assistance is needed. For example, in the passage it says, that the drivers seat will vibrate in case the vehicle may back over something. There are also flashing lights on the windshield as a warning sign. The inventors have also created cameras to make sure the car can watch the driver to be sure they are alert. A driverless car would be an amazing accomplishment but as of right now the car cannot do everything by itself. The drivers would still need to pay attention and be ready to take the wheel at any moment. Since the driverless car is still a work in progress, it cannot drive through construction or accident cites easily. The inventors of the car are making it safe with all the sensors and warning signals needed, but sometimes that is not enough, accidents still could occur. If an accident were to occur I do not believe that the manufacturers should be blamed. They have made the car the best they can and would not allow people to drive it without warning them about how the car works. In my opinion it would most likely be the drivers fault for not paying attention or neglecting the warnings of the car. A driverless car will be a fantastic accomplishment to be made. However, we as the potential drivers have to take caution and understand completely how to handle the car.

I know that someday there will be driverless cars that can travel through accident and construction cites without any help. However, until then we must work with what we have and try our best not to jeopardize the chances of building an actual driverless car. We as drivers can accomplish this by being alert when riding in a driverless car and being understanding if an accident were to occur. ",4
f4c2c4c,"In this writing prompt the topic that is going to be disscused is that if the Idea of technology going to be able to predict what humans are feeling an a emotional level.

The Idea of a facial expression reading computer is a good idea but for as long it is used for the right intentions such as using it to read picture of families to know how they are feeling, or using it for a class that is not interested into a subject so the computer alters the lesson to change up the lesson to make more entertaining for the students, but for advertisements that is not very good way to use technology in that way. If the human race is going to use technology like it should be used responsibily and used to help man kind to strive to become better.

The technology for this is remarkable and how we are going this far to use technolgy like this for only medical purposes, for learning, and to see if some one is lying or telling the truth. If it is going to be used to fill companies pockets full of cash for advertisements it shouldn't be allowed cause taking photos or using technology to invade on peoples privacy just to adjust their own benefits, and I can see it being used for purposes like art work just like the Mona Lisa .

The Facial Action Coding System(FACS) and really what makes it remarkable it tells you all of the emotions that they are feeling rather than just one specific emotion. It tells you from the emotion they feel the most to the one they feel the least about.

It is outstanding how technology could come so far in a short amount of time and their is a saying that comes with it comes great power, comes great responsibility and their is technology that is either taken for granted or it is misused for the all of the wrong reasons. The FACS or the facial action coding system it could be very useful in for medical research or it can help detectives to tell them what are witnesses or patients feeling so that they could help them get through their isssues in life.",3

It's important that it has it so that it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. According to the article Does the Electoral College worksource three states,In the 2012 election,for example Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the elcetoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney.I also what to keep the Electoral College so that nothing goes wrong if it gets changed. For example, if one thing in the electoral college is gone, then the whole thing may be affected by it.

45b6989,"The author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" he provides a lot of information about venus. The author also provides ways we could get people on venus without getting them injured.

The author wants to study venus because it is basically the Earth's ""twin"". Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. It also is occasionally the closest in distance. It is not always the closest because mars and venus moves at different speeds so one might be closer than the other.

Another reason why the author wants to study venus is because not one spacecraft has touched down on venus in more than three decades. Thats because the spacecrafts cannot handle the temperature. Venus temperature average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. Those conditions would liquefy many metals.

The author provided facts from the National Aernautics and Space Administration (NASA) on one of there ideas to get people to venus to study it. There idea was to create a vehicle that can hover 30 or so miles above the venusian landscape. The conditions would not be as harsh the temperature would only be around 170 degrees fahrenheit and the air pressure would be close to sea level on earth. Those condition are much easier for a human to survive in.

The three reason i stated are why the author thinks that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. They could create a vehicle that could avoid touching the surface . That also helps with the temperatures so humans can survive while studying.",3
d3bb699,"To begin, I feel like the Facial Action Coding System would start a big argument if it should be used or not. Most people are going to question the the software. For example, What if a student didn't want everyone to know thier emotions? Also, Isn't that kind of invation of privacy? But i can see the positive side of the new software to.

First of all, the new software ""Facial Action Coding System"", has a lot of positive sides about it. In paragraph six it says, ""A classroom computer recognizes when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This will modify the lesson it the computer reads that the student is confused or bored. Also, If the new system reads student emotions this could stop a lot of school shootings. Furthermore, If the new software doesn't recognize the student or person it could send an alert to the office and other classroom so the could lock their doors an hide.

Secondly, there are some negitives about the system. For example, in paragraph six it says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This shows that the computer needs to understand that too. Also, Isn't the new software kind of invading your privacy? Because, What if you don't want anyone to know your emotions? Is this really going to help students learn or lose human emotions?

All in all, I personally think the new software should be used only in schools for the students, teachers, and staffs around the world. If this system can recognize students and teachers then doing the attendance should be quick. This new software could save students lives and stop school shooting. Do you want your childrens lives safer at school than a dead zone of kids? ",3
abc1902,"This story talks about your facial emotions like Dr. Huang observed. He observed that the artisit such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enought to convey specific emotions. It helps them because if you're feeling sad you might go to the art muesum and see a picture that has a happy family and they can put a smile on your face. Another thing is that there is a muscle called Orbicularis Oculi Parrs Palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes if you didn't know about that. But also, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce. Also, in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the Zygomatic major and a different muscle called The Risorius. But to an expert, faces don't lie, these muscles clues are somtimes used tto spot a ""smiling"" politician or celbrity isn't being truthful. For example if you're feeling sad and your friend tells a funny joke you can fake a smile your friends won't even relize your faking a smile. Also a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, he had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowing (what a great way to practice) as a way of creating these emotions on stage and i think that's a really great way to practice because if they go up on stage and don't know how to do a really great emotion their drama teacher might get angry. In conclusion i think have a drama teacher teaching you how to do an emotion right and having computers to tell if your happy or sad or angry is a good thing to have in the world.",2
c201ec2,"In my own opinion I think driverless cars is a good and more effective idea than how we drive today. Driverless cars will make roads more safe for the driver, pedestrians, and other drivers on the road. Driverless cars is re-inventing how we've been driving for decades. The cars will use less gass and be more economy safe and they meet more people's needs unlike any bus or taxi ever could.

Study shows that a driverless car is less hazardous than any human driving. With a driverless car you don't have to worry about human mistakes, such as, someone picking up the phone and takings their eyes off the road; or someone putting on making up, brushing/combing their hair, or even eating while only keeping one hand attended to the wheel. A driverless car will alert the driver when there is danger ahead and will even come to a complete stop if necessary. Driverless cars won't run red lights, go over the speed limit, or even get out of control as a drunk driver would. Driverless cars is one of the many invention leading into the new world.

Cars that you won't have to drive is a good idea. I think they should be allowed in more states as long as they've been tested and proven to be safe. Driverless cars are hazardous free and economically beneficial, they would fundamentally change the world.",2
c1e3e01,"The Facial Coding System is a new computer that can recongize and calculate your emotions based on subtle facial movements. The software produced by Professor Huang and Professor Sebe works by constructing a 3-D model of a face and classifing it based on six basic emotions that humans typically express. The those emotions are then charaterised by movements of the facial muscles. In my opinion we should embrace new technology, but the question is, how will this change schools, marketing, and everyday life?

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" according to Dr. Huang. He goes on to say that the software can modify the lesson, like an ""effective human instructor. "" Imagaine being able to adjust a lesson to the liking of the majority of students, being able to create insteresting and engaging topics for students and teachers to enjoy. Not only that, many students will experience depression or anxiety during their middle school or high school life, this computer can help consulors help those students more effectively. Overall, schools could see a massive change in students moods after introducing this software.

Shcools wouldn't be the only ones to take advatange of this new technonlogy, companys that are trying to market and sell their product could calculate what is liked and disliked based on the emotions analyised after people view their products. Some people would make the claim that it is an invasion of priviacy, but wouldn't we want companys to sell the things we like, rather than the things we don't? Imagaine always having excatly what you like or excatly what you need pop up in an ad, or suddenly become available at the nearest store. Not only do you get what you need, companys will be able to make more money, helping the economy grow, and hopfully that money makes its way back to you someday.

Aside from schools and marketing, how can this effect everyday life? The articles states that

""we humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" everyday."" we may not be able to tell the precentage of a person sadness or happiness, but we can determine when a friend is excited or bored. Imagaine being able to calculate your own happiness like weighing your self on a scale. Imagine that the software not only measures your happiness, but analyises what may be causing your stress and how to improve as a person. The world may truly becoming a better place.

The Facial Action Coding System seems far from becoming wildy accessiable to the public, but to me this new computer software will one day change our lives. From school, to companys, and our own personal life, this technonlogy can one day make life a little bit happier.    ",5
89a457f,"Today in this essay, im going to tell you why we should us this on students. The should also use them on not only on the students, This new technology should be used on the teachers and staff as well.

The main reason i believe this should be used in schools, is to see how the students reaction is the they way teachers are teaching them. Think about it. If most of the students are 80 percent bored, 10 percent happy, and 10 percent angry because they aren't learning in a way they should in schools then, it might be time for change. The teachers should expirement with this new age technology. As they try to change there teaching style, they can use the facial reconizion to see if most student like they way he or she is teaching. If this were to be in schools then, the studend could be more like Mona Lisa, 83 percent happy, 9 percent discusted 6 percent ferful and 2 percent angry.

Not only should the students have to use it, the teachers should have to use it as well. Some people might wonder "" Why would the teachers have to use it, they aren't the ones learning?"" Ill tell you why they should have to us this facial emotion dector. If the teachers are grumpy all the time or, if they aren't happy at there carrer, they need fired. Now tell me this. If the teachers are always mad and hate there job, how do you expect the students to learn if the teacher is mad all the time. They'll just throw a paper at them and tell them to work. With this new equipment, you can use it to see if a teacher is happy. You can see if the teacher can make the class fun so the students will be happy.

In conclusion, I believe that the emothion reader should be in schools. This should be used not only for the students but, for the teachers as well. If the teacher isnt happy the teacher is always mad, the kids will be unhappy and bored in class. The student won't get the quality education that they could've from the start. Thank ypu for taking time out of your day to read my essay and, have a wonderful day.         ",3
fe7e9af,"Losing a privilege to drive a car is a risk. Some people use cars for there main transportation. In some places you will found countries and nations that dont limits you to drive a car anymore. Those places are Germany, Paris, and Bogota,Columbia. These cities limit the right of driving a car, but the citizens agree in many different ways.

In Vauban,Germany the  citizens are happy that most people dont have cars. The citizens think its an great idea no cars are on the street. They have certain places that you can park if you own a car. There's only two places you can park and those two places are the large garages at the edge of the development, and you have to buy a space for $40,000, along with a new home. There is 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. They think that cars wouldve been to much for them and that since the cars has been gone it has had a big impact in the German society thta has lower the transportation bills 80 percent down by the law.

In Paris, the cars have been moved off the street due to smog. The smog happened when the pollution started. There was almost 4,000 drivers fined for refusing to follow the orders. Paris has also created a new tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. The diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. Paris averages more smog than any other European capitals.'' Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compare with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found. The Paris people have come to a conclusion that its cars and diesel has effected its community and such more but its the main reasin why paris has the advantages of limiting car usage to the people.

In Bogota,columbia its a new program that sets to spread to other countries. After the program started Colombians have begin hiking, bike riding, and skating to reduce the traffic jams. Its the third straight year cars have been banned with just taking a bus and only taxis for a day. In the capital of 7 million people the goal is to try and promote an alternative transportation and reduce the smog pollution. The violators will have to face $25 fines.'' It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. For the first time ,two other colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, have joined the event. The Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota and joined the event. A day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid 1990s. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city.

Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" (paragraph 3) Yes, there are a lot of dangers and the human race can be hurt, but what happens when the earth runs out of supllies to support the human race? Where will we ge then?

It is important to explore all of the other options we have when it comes to places for the human race to go when we run out of supplies and options. Yes, Venus has a lot of risk but when it comes to saving the human race I think it's a risk worth taking. There are a couple things that the Earth and Venus have in common. ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" There are postive things about Venus as well. Every option is going to have it's negitives and it's postivies.

""NASA's possible soltins to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.

When is comes to the human race and having a plan B, I think this is something to consider.

Yes, there are quite a few risk when it comes to moving the human race to live on Venus. But NASA thinks that they have a way around that. There a couple things that Earth and Venus even have in common when it comes to the geographical aspects of the planets. Yes, living on Venus comes with changes and yes, it would be a big change.

d4d3041,"The new technology ""Facial Acting Coding System"" or FACS, would not be useful in a classroom enviroment today, the creator Eckman has this new technology set up with 6 main emotions; Happiness, Surprise, Anger, Fear, Sadness and Discust. The idea could be great for classroom use, but the way I feel that it would be exicuted seems ike a viloation of privacy and an unecissary cost to schools.

In the article it is said that the FACS technology could be used in a classroom setting, it could tell if a student was bored or confused to possibly change the lesson to be more interesting. This seems that it could also be an evasion of this students privacy. If they are really sad becuase of home problems or other things, the student may not want the program or the teacher to know about it. With this type of software you could really evaide someones privacy and there personal thoughts.

The article also says that a home computer can not compute the algorythims that this program is running, does that mean the school is going to have to get a ""super computer"" just to know if a student finds a topic in school intresting. I feel that the cost all together is not worth it, becuase why would someone who has spent so much time and money on the technology give it away for free. It seems like a lot of work for Eckman to give it out for free, even if it were to better education.

One other problem with this FACS technology is how accurate is it, could a student fake a emotion just to not learn a new subject that is hard. I'm sure that most people can fake an emotion to get something, a lot of people when they were children have faked an emotion to get something, weather that was candy or a new toy. Most people have done it, wether or not you have.

I do not feel that there is need for a program like this to be put into schools, if this program were to be put into advertising then it would be very profitable. But in a class room situation it is not needed at all, there is really no value to have this in our classrooms with all of the questions that we still have about it, along with the technology not being 100 percent accurate.",4
a107f0f,"I believe that there are many advantages when it comes to limiting car usage. Using cars for transportation has been around for nearly a decade, starting with the very first car to run on gas ever made. Many believe that having a car makes life more convenient. But there are many more cons that justify the right to limit car usage.

The first advantage to limiting car usage would be the most obvious one, which is economical purposes. Buying a car usually means spending thousands of dollars all at once or having to pay a bill every month until the full price of the car is payed. This does not include the price for gas or other needs the car could have. Things like oil changes, transmission failure, or even something as simple as a flat tire could cost well over a hundred dollars just to fix all depending on the situation. This is not even considering the chance that your car could just stop functioning and you would need to buy a new car, which would lead to the ugly circle of life you just went through with your old car.

Not only is limiting car use good economically, but also enviromentally friendly as well. Studys shown that cars and other vehicles like this are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. This could be very dangerous in a place where many people live.

Another advantage would be that if there are less cars, there would be less accidents as well. Many deaths that have been occuring over the pass year are all car related. Things like natural storms that destroy cars or drinking and driving could be prevented if car usage is limited. If car usage was limited, the death toll would definitly get smaller.

One last advantage limiting car usage would bring is the gift of excersise. Many believe a car is very convenient due to the fact that it can get you where you want to go in a small amount of time which, in fact, could be very useful for special occasions. However, when it comes to using a car limits to driving to a gas station 4 blocks away from where you live just for snacks, that's when things get out of hand. If you want to get somewhere, there are other ways besides cars that are safe and healthy for you. You could ride a bike, or even walk to where you want to go and still get the excersise you wouldn't get from using a car.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why car usage should be limited. However, that does not mean i don't beileve in the usage of cars. Cars are a advancement in technology for people to get to where they need to go without a hassle. A gift like that should not be taken advantage of. People can still use cars, but in moderation. And if we take the time to walk or ride a bike, you will be healthy, happy, and have a pocket full of money left over.                       ",4
8c67c23,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" i chosed to be on the maunufacturers side becuase the sensor is a good and safe idea for us people that drive. they can ster, accelerate,and break by themselves. There are some sensor that have a vibration in the seat it tells you when your vehicle is in danger backing into a danger.

object . Also using heads up displays when your driving like some thing are not available like trying to text and call someone on the phone.

The driverless car is a great idea beacuse the car tells you when you should break. Reason why this is a good ideas it can steer for you what if it really slippery out and you have no controll the sensor will help you keep calm of the car. The sensor tell you when you should go fast and slow down. this may reduce the amount of car crashes.

The senor that vibrate when you are driving is a well thought process because is your driving of the rode your seat will virbate telling you your off the road. also it tells you when you need to get back in your lane when you are driving. this will reduce car crashes because it helps indacte where you are driving.

lastley the camera and the beeping noise the car will make helps you move out the way. the sensor tells you when you are too close to a dangerous object so you should stop.            ",2
cf1d8ab,"The electoral college is a symbol of mockery and deprivation of our rights. Voting using this system to elect our leaders is proven null and serves to be removed. Implementing the popular vote in society will not only modernize it but give america its full name for democracy. For many years presidency has debated its ability to be renounced from Electoral college votes or the popular vote. The electoral college is a symbol of our rights as a US citizen being swept under our feet. More formally, this needs to be changed so the people of the U.S can have a greater say in our government, and those who run the country. Granting this power, we will not only modernize but become more democratic(Plumer-Paragraph-9).

According to the article "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, Not only do citizens agree with changing our system our own appointees do to. Major figures in politics like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole and the U.S Chambe or commerce all agree to the abolishment of electoral college voting privaleges. A poll of over 6/10 voters agree that a direct election should be implemented by the people. This topic can be contreversal though. The best argument that reinstates its purpose says "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"". So whats the contreversy about we elect them so they elect what we want. The best argument against this is the disaster factor. In the 1960's, segregationists in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing democratic electors by electing electors who oppose John F. Kennedy(Plumer-Paragraph-10-11)

There are numerous factors that contribute towards the banishment of the Electoral College. Ranged from the favoritism of big states with big populations hence the higher amount of electoral votes, to the possibility of a tie in electoral votes. The system is unfair and a symbol of non modern democracy. Direct voting offers a chance to citizens of the US the ability to exercise voting and become part of the government in which we follow. If we always lived in this system, improvements must go on as time progresses so we as a nation can improve to become better. Changing our government is just another major step in our progress to becoming the most sucessful nation.

Changing our system so the voters of the US governize america by direct election is a essential change. According to the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" numerous stories have been told that the Electoral college is an act of anachronism(Posner-Paragraph-15). If the people of the US work hard to remove this we can modernize society forever and make US a better democracy. If we fail to do so, we risk taking a major step backwards in time causing another seggregation act. We have been deprived of many of our rights for too long throughout history and now we have the ability to change. The electoral college has been a shaded act of seggregation and need to dperived of its rights and shut down at a notice.    ",4
1f94e33,"Thinking of the 21st century ideas of driving cars and SUV's around is considred fairly overrated now a day's. Opperating moto vehicle in city scapes and rural areas can get so overwhelming; the constant worry of oncomming traffic and pedestrians steering into your direction, dangerous pollution threatning to dystroy the ecosystems & surrounding landscapes, not to mention expenses that are strung along with the cost driving a car. By eliminating or limiting the use of cars, these unnessary issues would just simply....float away.

As we all know as a result of past generations: Global Warming is on the rise. This statement is esspecially true in the city of Paris, France...named to be the most polluted city in the world amoung tourist destinations in Europe. In a act to reduce these smog issues, ""On Monday motorist with even-numbred licence plates were ordred to leave their cars at home or suffera 22-euro fine"" says Robert Duffer who wrote from the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" in the

Chicago Tribune.

Ever since Paris officals had made this change in leglisation, pollution has gone down considerabley. Imagine driving through your city (for example I live in Jacksonville Beach), and there is no more smog, traffic is reduced, and the air you breathe is actually cleaner than before. From putting certian restraints like the city of Paris did on commuting, you too could experince all the wonders of ""cut-back driving"".

Moving onto another terrific viewpoint of limited car usage is a cut down on cost. Now how great does that sound, and in this expanding economy I'll be happy if gasoline prices drop below $2 dollars! On a serious note, the price tags of a car are extreamly heavy now as they were say two decades ago. There are matanince issues, speeding tickets, parking meter tickets, if you have a flat tire then you call a tow truck which....

COST MONEY!

""New York's new bike-sharing program and it's skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation"" says Elisabeth Rosenthal from ""The End of Car Culture"". Now in modern cities like New York, Miami, or even Jacksonville, many city officals have made this ninche of transportation much easier on civilans. Providing local trollys & public busses to help cut the cost of transportation for their residences. As exemplary from Rosenthal, its makes you happy not to drive a car as often... and makes you wallet happy too!

Although many critics are skeptical to obtain and enforce this idea, in actuallity this would be a tremendous favor to all if they participated. Sure if you don't have a car to use for example on a Saturday, then it may seem like a bummer but in perspective it's actually not! Getting around your local area and exploring all it has to offeroutside the four doors of you ""gas-hogger"" is a beautiful way to go through your day! Just think of all the cha-ching you'll be saving with every footstep you take.

NBC Nightly News . Can you imagine that happening to you, or has it already? Heidrun Walter a media trainer and mother of two says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" since making the change of on-foot commute and biking to distant locations. I live in a beautiful beach side town where almost everything is acessable by walking, biking, city bus, Beaches Trolly, or a surfboard! I myself have tried this and rode my bike up to Trader Joe's to get some ice cream. I can say I felt very stress-free by the whole experince. From simply switching to a non-automatic or mechanical form of transportation I not only relived my tension of road rage. I also had gained great deal of happiness from being outdoors.

In my last few final statements about the pros from limiting the usage of a vehicle, is it's just better. I dont know what other methods are so EASY to follow to get the results you want to the problems and issues people struggle with. Worry about the enviorment? Try limiting you car driving to every other day. Want more money in your pockets insted of in your car? Take the

transportation thats provided in your local area to get around you city in. Want to ease the stress that major highways and opperating a motor vehicle bring on? Get out and about by walking or biking to get from place to place. I can guarentee you'll love ti reap the rewards by limiting the usage of you car!    ",5
34ee3cc,"I believe that the face was land made because in the picture from 1976 in the fifth pharagraph, it looks like a face. But when you look at the other pictures at the top of the article you don't see any dips that point towards alien creation. I belive that like, in the article, it was just an effect of the light and shadows. The shadows could have been made by a higher point of the mesa and when the light hit it just right, it made it look like a face. In the last pharagraph, Jim Garvin, the cheif scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program said, "" It reminds me of Snake River Plain in Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

To me Garvin's idea of what the Face on Mars really is, seem very logical. There have been land formations that people say are made by aliens. But, for all we know it could have been man made millions of years ago. We will never know because we don't have strong enough evidence to prove if it was man made, a creation made by aliens, or was simply made over time. Looking at the third image at the top of the article, you can see that there is nothing on the surface of the Face on Mars. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern thins in a digital image 3 times bigger then the pixle size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shake, you could see what they were."" Garvin said in pharaghraph eleven.

From far away the Face looks like, well, a face. But, once you get a close up of it you can see that it was only a forplay of shadows. The things that we hear about on the news, in magazines, radio talk shows, films, and books get so blown out of praportion that people will read it and believe that there really is a face on mars that was created by aliens. I understand that there are some things that we really don't know about, and maybe never will. But, I believe that if there are aliens, that we would be given some strong evidence that they were on mars, earth or wherever.

But, for now, we will have to keep looking into things and discover more things about earth and the things that happened on earth and to earth millons of years ago. When technoligy advances and we get more chances to look at things and get deeper into research, we will know if there really are aliens or not.",4
a28eea6,"The elecotral college was a good solution many years ago to have a compromise between the election of President by Congress and to have the election of President by popular vote. Today, we have found flaws in the system.

To begin with, we fought many years to make voting right equal no matter your race, sex, or wealth. Shouldn't we keep that in mind, it would be more fair if everyone's individual vote counted. We shouln't have to let soemone vote for us. After we made this an equal country we should keep it that way.

In addition, some states have more people than others and if they only get a certain amount of voters not everyone really gets a say in the election. Therefor, if everyone gets their own vote the in the election the winner is truely who the citizens want to win. The number of electors can't make everybody in the state happy. Also, the ""My vote counted"" stickers you get after you vote aren't completly true in this system.

Next, we even have a name for what might happen... the disastor factor. You can't garuntee that the elector you vote for will elect who you want to really win. In this case you could elect oppent and not even realize it. If everyone's individual votes counted that would be solved, you know exactly who you are voting for.

In conclusion, the electoral college was a good idea many years ago. It made many years of voting easier but, now we see the flaws in it. The best way to elect the leader of our country is to have everyone have an equal vote.    ",3
d5bb5fc,"Richard Nion, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole and other companies have all agreed to abolish the Electoral College and I to agree for many reasons. One of the major issue is that the voters don't know what really happens to thier vote. Another issue to add is that ''the electoral collage is unfair, outdated, and irrational"".

Do the citizens that go and vote for their candidate actually choose for the candidate's electors? In the text is states that not only do I vote for candidate's electors but also '' help choose the state's electors when you vote for the president''. This meaning that my vote counts for several things, but was I aware? Maybe not because I simply think I'm voting for a candidate running for presidenty not the candidate's elector. The Electoral College was ment for a compromise between Congress and Citizens not all these extra people.

''This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could loose again''. Certainly this doesn't makes sence because how could the winner of the votes loose? Which is one of the reasons why the the Electoral College is unfair. Also in the beggining of the article it's said that '' A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President''. Meaning that the president already has an advance in the votes. I think that the Electoral College process should be gone for its unfairity and be replaced to a new way of election.

In the new way of electing our president should be in a few steps and also not worrying about the candidate already having an advanced amount of votes. Instead of the votes going place to place they should just be in the state and counted for equaly no ajustments, then after the election send to Congress or the National Archives as part of the offical records of the presidential election.

In conclusion the electoral College should be taken out permantly and be replaced by a new way or process when it comes to the citizens votes and the election of the cadidates.    ",3
3755a66,"The idea of driverless cars is astounding. The thought of people no longer needing to buy cars is wonderful. It would cut down on pollution and deaths/injuries caused by automobile accidents.

The use of autonomous cars will decrease the amount of pollution in the atmosphere. The amount of pollution will be cut down by simply cutting down the amount of cars. One proposal for this is using autonomous cars a type of taxi system. The text states, "" Google cofounder Segey Brin can. He envisions a future with a public transport system where fleets of autonomous cars form a public-transport taxi system."" This shows that some of the worlds leading investors are looking at making public transport of only driverless cars possible. Another way it would cut down on pollution would be the amount of fuel consumption. Driverless cars are predicted to need half as much fuel as conventional cars. The text illustrates, ""The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus."" This means that driverless cars, when used in a taxi-like situation, would be more fuel efficient and more practical than todays public transport system.

Another way autonomous cars would be beneficial is the safety they provide. Computers are more alert than humans and are always doing their job. This would mean that the nbumbe rof deaths and injuries because of car accidents would decrease. The text states, ""In 2013 BMW announced the developement of 'Traffic Jam Assistant.' The car can handle driving funtions at speeds of up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure that the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This shows that even though the car is doing majority of the driving, such as controlling speed and direction, the driver must remain alert while in the car in case of emergencies. Another way that autonomous cars make driving safer is onboard alerts. The car watches the road for hazards and if it finds one, alerts the driver. The text illustrates, ""While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" This shows htat even though the driver may be focused on the road the car is focused on making sure the driver is driving safely.

Both of these advances will greatly change the way we drive. They will also help our everyday lives and make life more enjoyable.",4

a950ff9,"Have you ever been confused on how the president is elected from two huendred and sevendy votes when you see more than a that many poeple a day.  Well I'm not because I can't vote, but I do think that the Electoral College should stay in action.  People may not like the Electoral College because it isn't there vote that really dessideds the winner of the eletion.  I am in favor for the Electoral College because it does help us out even if we don't always see it.

The Electoral College helps us by avioding run-off elctions, where the votes are too close to desside a clear winner. It does this by in most states the majority of the popular votes dessides where all the votes go.  ""That pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.""(Posner)  In the 2012 election the populor vote in Florida was very close and if the president was dessided form the popular vote Floride would have had little effect on the eletion, but since the Electoral College dessides the winner, Obama had tweinty nine more votes to his campaign.  ""Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all the winning presidental candidate.""(the Office of the Federal Register)

Some people may thing that the Electoral College sould be done away with so that the president can be dessided by popular votes.  If this were to happen then there would be the chance to have run-off elections, since there would be no clear winner if the votes were very close.  There would be the complete unbalance from state to state, Rhode Island would have little to no effect on the election, where as with the Electoral College it could be the state to choose the winner.

The Electoral College keeps it so that each state has a bigger impact on the election and saves us from run-off elections from a close number of votes.  If we didn't have the Electoral College in place then history would be different for better or for worse, but I think that the Electoral College should be here to stay.

In paragraph nine it states that ""our traffis laws for our states are under the assumpiton that the only safe way for a car is to have a human under control"", and thats beause our traffic laws are based on human error. So basically if a said law is broken then the human gets the bad end of the deal, but if its a driverless car who will get the blame for a traffic law being broken the company that made it or the owner of the driverless car? Also in paprgraph 7 it basically said the car can drive its self unless if it needs human help and that the driver must always has his or her hands on the wheel. Basically saying we are able to regain control if needed, but what if we couldn't because the car is acting up and then we get injured or get others hurt. So what I am trying to say is you never know if its safe.

c31558d,"Driverless cars could change the world. If we had cars that could do the driving for us, we could avoid wrecks and traffic jams. Googles driverless cars have drove over half a million miles without a single crash! Having driverless cabs would be amazing, especially if they took up less gas.

If we didnt have to worry about things like wrecks and traffic jams, life in cities could become much easier. Driving would become much more effecient if we didnt have to worry about human error. We could get to places much faster and safer.

The driverless cab idea would be amazing if we had the technology to do that. We need to be able to make driverless cars safer before being able to legalize them in the states. I'm sure in time that we will reach the technology. Once they are completely safe then there will be no reason for it to be illegal.

Being able to notify a driver in a sticky situation would be helpful as well. They could help us be more aware of our surroundings. Maybe they could even see blindspots.

b45db5f,"Facial Action Systems in Classrooms

Using facial action coding for students in a classroom is valuble. This is becuase it can be used to help better teach students. Its especially valuble becuase the software can modify lesson plans, as well as be used in simmulatons, and the software can be easily implemented in classrooms. This technology would also boost productivity in students.

Using facial recognition would be important because it can be used to modify lesson plans, based on the emotions detected. In other words if a student is bored or confused, the software can detect it and can make the lesson more attention grabbing, or use a different teaching method. An example of this was mentioned in the article when Dr. Huang said, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (D'alto, 1). This is important becuase it gives direct evidence of the plans for this technology, and a method it could be used effectivly on students.

The technology can be used in learning simulations. This is valuble becuase more human communication is non verbal. Dr. Huang notes, ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication...So computers need to understand that, too"" (D'alto, 1). In using this technology we can create more human like and responsive simulations, that can be implemented in classrooms. This could help create more life like surgery simulations or anything envolving human interaction or communication.

Some might argue that the technology would be difficult to implement, but despite popular belief it is relativly easy to implement. Despite most technology not being able to decode somewhat incripted messages in famous works of art such as the Mona Lisa it can still be used to encode different emotions. Nick D'Alto writes, ""we can still write down some simple instructions that 'encode' different emotions."" (page, 1). This quote shows that it's not difficult for a larger span of people to begin using this technology, and our schools education could be significantly changed at a relativly low expense.

To conclude facial action coding technology is valuble to classrooms. Not only can it be used to modify lesson plans, and improve simulations, despite common belief it can also be easily implemented. Overall it can be used to amplify productivity though easily implementing this Facial Action Coding System.          ",4
a62eb30,"The future technologies are improving, and the driverless car becomes popular these days. People dream about driving without the driver; car of course, taxi, bus, train, and air plane. It can bring us convenience. A lot of companies already started working on their driverless vehicles project, it will take huge part of the market in the future.

Driverless car can lead our future technology. It seems useful and practical. However, everything has their pros and cons, so does driverless car. In my opinion, driverless car can't driving without the driver, but it can help drivers drive easily and safely. Here is my articles to support my opinion.

First, it can ruin people's job. A lot people make money from working in the transportation company, if driverless car gets popular, nobody will need a taxi driver or a bus driver anymore. Pilots of trains and planes will no longer needed as well. It is hard to get a job these days even if you graduate the decent college, the driverless car will make this worse.

Second, the sensors and auto systems can help the drivers to drive, but it can't control all process of driving. Sometimes the computer doesn't work properly as our desktops or laptops do, it can cause errors any time. Sometimes driving needs human's ability, especial it's a sudden situation.

Third, the problem of responsibility. For example, if your driverless car hits the person in front of you, it is ambiguous to figure out who has the responsible for the accident. The car company, and the customers will argue to blame each other.

Driverless car can bring convenience to us. It seems very helpful, but it also has obivous problems. People are improving technologies right now at this time as well. But the important thing is people should think more carefully of pros and cons of the future technologies rather than just chasing the benefit in front of them. ",3

11cf6b8,"Do you think the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) should be used in any technology today? I think that the Facial Action Coding System isn't a value because all technology is NOT 100% correct. There ould be a time when the computer glitches and mess up. Its not just a computer that glitches, its all electronics. Such as phones,tablets,video games and any other electronics you can think of. The FACS has no use because you can tell when a person is sad or mad or even angry.

Even if a person dont show facial expressions on how they feel they will feel that way deep inside. For example, students could be happy coming to school talking to their friends,just be in happy mood but when they get home they are depress and they start to act different. As days go on this student is changing as a person and people start to notice when you change. Everbody has different facial expressions each day if a person is not feeling that day they will show it. You can't use a computer just to show how people feel. The computer can tell people that your happy just because you smile all day but really your mad,sad,and depressesd but no one will ever know because of the way that the technology is set up. i still feel like the FACS shouldnt have never been created.

i still feel that way because,like the text stated ""you can probably tell how a friend is looking simply by the look on their face."" you can also tell when you hang around a certain person everyday and they start to change and their facial expression start to change, their body language will also start to change. Just because you smile alot dont mean your happy .When you smile you muscles in your smile starts to change but that don't mean your happy your still sad. if your were to get tested on the machine they would considered you happy just because you smile alot but really you just depressed .

i know all of this imformation because when im at school i get serious and focus on my school work. During lunch i laugh and play with my friends and giggle all the time but when im at home its a different story. By me being the middle child i get treated differently so i always look angry when im at home . 95% of the time i try to keep a smile on my face but the other 5% i try to stay away from, because i dont want to be angry all the time i wanna be happy and make other people happy too. if i was to get tested the computer would say 100% happy.

No one should use the FACS if they know how they feel. Everybody know what wrong with them and what their issue is. You shouldn't need a machine to tell you something you already know. I know im not the only one that feel this way but everybody has their own opinion. This concludes on why i feel like the FACS should of NEVER been created.",3
0072128,"Imagine a world without garages, gastations, or parkinglots. The problem with today's world is our lives revovle around cars to get us where we want to be and they have become a status symbol for many.  The thought of being without a car scares most people, but limiting car usage is becoming more popular in cities, and has shown many advantages in the enviorment and in the communities.  For example, the residents of Vauban, Germany have given up their cars compltely (Rosenthal).  On the otherhand, Paris, France banded driving due to smog-only odd license plates could drive one day and even numbered plates could drive the next day (Duffer).  Many advantages came with limiting driving in these cities such as, less air poplution from tailpipes, congestion lessened, and indroduced alternative ways of transportaion into differnet communities.

""Passenger cars are 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the Unites States"" (Rosenthal).  This means if car usauge was limited than we could cut back on almost 50 percent of our polution in the United States.  ""Transportation is the second largest source for America's emissions"" (Rosenthal).  The limiting of car usage would also help and knock down cars as being the second biggest emissions source in the U.S.  Without so much air polution in the United States we could live healthier and better lives.  We would be able to ruduce global warmimg if we reduce the amount of driving we do.

Another advantage with limiting car usage would be the decrease in congestion around our city and towns.  ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog"" (Duffer). This means that traffic would die down as well, there would be no more rush hour after work, and the roads would be safer because there would be less people driving on them.

Lastly, limiting car usage would bring people to find alternative and healthier ways to get to where they need to be.  In Bogota, Colombia every year for one day millions of people bike, skateboard, or take public transport to get where they want to be (Selsky).  With people using alternative ways to get to work it would not only  benefit the enviorment as well as benefiting their health.

The answer is clear, we need to limit the usage of cars in America.  Other countries are doing it and now is our time to jump on board with the movement of less car movement.  So the next time you get in the car and buckle your seatbelt think about the advantages that could come from not driving today.         ",4

""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navagating through work zones and around accidence.""

Also if people were interested in buying the diverless car would an average person be able to affort it? In paragragh number 4 it clearly says that the car needs many tools and special equitment to be able to be a driverless car. ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an intertial motion sensor.""

Not only would the car itself cost alot, it would also take millions to be able to fix all the roads in order for the car to be able to drive on the roads. In paragragh number 3 it states that the car requies magnets in the road to be able to read the messages in binary code, but would be too expensive. ""These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they require massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.""

Finally one of my biggest concerns is that if the driverless car does not need the driver at all times would it make it easier for younger kids to get in the car, start it, and take off? In paragragh number 7 it says that all it takes is the drivers hands to be on the wheel for the car to go. ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" Since the driverless car can do alot on its own the car could make it easy for a young child to get in it and leave while not being watched properly.

In conclusion, I belive that people should keep driverless cars off the road for many reasons. For example, people are not having full control of the car. The car may not be afordable to the average person. It would take millions for the road to be fixed and be able to have driverless cars to work on the roads. Finally it would be seriously dangerouse for a young child to get in the car and the car start driving on its own. ",4
1f30de7,"Have have you ever wanted to learn more about something like about a person or maybe... a planet? This essay is on unmasking the face on Mars, is it real? or fake?

Well is is in fact real in here are the reasons why.

First, it is real because Twenty five years ago we spotted something weird happening on Mars. One of our spacecrafts, The Viking 1, was getting pictures of what may be possible land sites for its sister ship, The Viking 2. It was then that we noticed something strange, it was like a shadowy likeness of a human face. It had an ENORMOUS head nearly almost two miles end to end. it ALMOST looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Next, a few days later we unveiled the image for everyone to see...even though we were not sure how everyone would react. But to NASA's surpise, everyone loved it it was in movies, books,magazines etc. There were some people out there who didn't belive it, said it was probably fake and that we were just trying to scare people into thinking aliens were real. But it was real alright and we have the evidence to prove it.

Third, even though few scientists believed it to the Face of an alien artifact, the photos of Cydonia became important to NASA when the Global Surveyor (MGS) to the Mars in September. After 18 years, the Viking missions ended. Not every one was okay with though. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north latitude, it was winter in April 1998. It was a cloudy time of the year on Mars. We tried to take a look at it one more time but it was to late. When the cloudiness ended on mars we had put another spacecraft on Mars. when we got pictures back you could then all the detail and more on the face.

Even though some people may still not ever believe it, we just want them to just acknowledge the thought of '' What If?''. Then maybe they could see that this really is an anicent alien mark.  ",3
da09d2f,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests the opinion that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Throughout the article, the author brings up many of those dangers but also many ways to prevent them and all the upsides to visiting the planet. The author supports the idea very well throuhout the article.

The author begins the article by stating all of the dangers of actually having a human visit or land on Venus. The article mentions that no spacecraft has survived more than a few hours because of such harsh conditions. Those harsh conditions begin with the temperature. On Earth it is rare to get much higher than 110 degrees Fahrenheit, but on Venus, the average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahreheit. Venus is closer than Earth to the sun, with an atmosphere made up of about 97 percent carbon dioxide and with clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The author also mentions to worsen the conditions, it is common to have erupting volcanoes, major earth quakes, and big lightning strikes across the planet. To put these conditions into perspective, the author mentions that even Earth's deepest submarines would be crushed when placed on Venus.

After the author mentions all the horrible dangers of studying and visiting Venus, all the good that would come from the trip is brought up. For example, the author mentions that the planet is the most like Earth and it would be incredibly helpful to NASA and the whole world to research Venus and actually send someone to visit the planet. The author also mentions that at certain times, Venus is the closest to Earth which would make for a shorter travel time than visiting another planet. The author also highlights that Venus very well could hvae supported forms of life many years ago.

Lastly, to prove the opinion of the article, the author brings up counter arguments to all of the current dangers many people have about sending someone to Venus. The temperature issue is solved along with the air pressure issue when the author suggests the idea that NASA has to possibly send a blimp-like spacecraft to float around Venus, just 30 miles up and off the surface. The author states that this would reduce te temperature to around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, which is actually phisically possible to live with, and a similar air pressure to the Earth's. Although this blimp idea will provide limited insight, a human could actually survive this trip.

In conclusion, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The article supports this by first giving a list of dangers, then giving reasons to go through with the idea, and lastly presenting a way to fix previous issues. The author knows what he is talking about, addresses each issue strongly and confidently, and supports his idea very successfully.   ",4
4b47532,"Driverless cars are the future. No matter which side you are on they will make there way on to hte treets in this lifetime. There is a downside to this. There is no more joy in driving. The car can malfunction and crash. Lastly the cars can misintepret the maps and send people way off course. These are a few reasons why I believe

that self-driving cars shouldnt be a reality till we can confim that the risks are lower than the rewards.

The first reason why i believe driverless cars shouldnt be a thing is because there is no joy in driving anymore. If we have cars that drive for us why would kids want to be excited to get a licence. Why would engineers want to build cars that go faster if no one is going to drive them. Another reason is why would people even buy a car if they can just rent a self driving car or call a driverless taxi to take them where they need to go.

My second reason for why i think driverless cars shouldn't happen at this point and time is because the car can malfunction and crash. Not only can

the car malfunction it also relies on the driver to pay attention. If the car malfunctions and goes off course who is to blame the manufacturer or the driver. This was a question from the article the makes me wonder what will happen if the car has a promblem and hurts many people. Another point I want to

make is that the car still requires the attention and

as drivers we already have distractions and a car buzzing and beeping everytime you look away could be the one to cause the driver to an accident.

The last reason why I dont agree with driverless cars is because the car might misread the maps and send people of coures or they might even be seriuosly or fatialy injured. If people rely on the cars sensors to update for them what happens when the sensor malfuctions and the car doesnt alert the driver. What will happen when the car's maps arent up to date and the car runs 69 mph into a constrution site or a police officer making a traffic stop. This is just a few circumstances that could turn into a reality with driverless car.

For these reasons that I believe that the driverless car shouldn't

be on the streets. There is no joy in driving. The car malfuntion and crash. Lastly the car can misread the maps and senosrs and cause serious injury. Thaty is why driverless cars shouldn't be the way of the future.       ",4
0f81127,"It is often said that ""change is good."" This saying is one way to describe my feelings towards the Electoral College. The sources ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefinsible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wronga' by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner show the pros and cons of the Electoral College. The Electoral College should be taken over by popular votes because all Americans should have a say in who their next leader will be.

The Electoral College may disregard what their voters say and vote for another candidate to be our next President. In paragraph 11 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it is declared that ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate."" Voting citizens of America vote for a reason. They vote for who they want to be President, not who the party's electives want to be President. Voters should be able to trust their electors, otherwise their votes are going to a candidate they voted against. Another key point of this unjust way of voting is that people have to put their trust into unknown electors. It is stated in paragraph 16 of ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner ""each of the party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee."" These electors may be ""trusted"", but to the unknowing voters of America they are ordinary people who could betray someone very easily. All it takes is one elector disobeying his promise to the candidate he chose to represent to have the fate of American changed.

The winner of the election may lose by popular vote and win by electoral votes. This is an unfair advantage that the Electoral College has to the common voters. Voters expect to vote for who they selected, not who the Electoral College selects. It is empahsized in paragraph 10 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plummer in which ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors."" In simpler terms, this is saying you don't vote for the next leader, you vote for people who may choose the next leader. The people of America vote for a reason, to choose our next leader who will support our country. They don't vote to have a College of unknown Electors choose the next President. It should also be noted that you're techniacally not even voting for a President. It is disputed in paragraph six of ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" In other words, you don't even choose your candidate, just people who are trusted to vote for them. American voters want to for the nex president, not a board of Electors that they are unsure will trust them.

On the contrary, there is the possibilty of it being a very close election where it would require the Electoral College to choose a President. In paragraph 18 of the source ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" Richard A. Posner states ""a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" The popular vote might be back and forth between the Presidents, but an electoral vote would create more of a landslide win. In the end, the cons of the Electoral College outweigh the pros of it.

The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing our country's next leader. The change of this ancient voting would be a very good and appreciatef one. If America really let the people of America choose, they would let the popular vote be the deciding factor for our next President of the United States.               ",5
4a40a03,"I think that driverless car will be pretty cool, but I don't know I would feel safe with them. Eventhrough, the human driver can take over when requires to, I still don't feel safe with a carmera being in the car and the car watching me. Also, if the car does start to break down and the signals don't go off, what will have to that humand driver and other passagers? Will ther be insurance for them? Will it happen to other cars? And what happens when other people found out what happened to the car the broke down and caused an accident? Because I doubt they are going to want to keep driving that driverless car. These are things the manufacturers have to watch out for and many others.

I am not say I don't like that idea of a driverless car, I am just saying that they need to put everyting that can happen into concerteration. Not everyone is going to want a driverless car. Some people are going to want to keep their human driven cars. But I do thing it can be done and it will be done, someday in the near future.

Therefore, driverless cars are not impossible, but I don't think that today is that day is the day. We need to research ever possiblity before it happens. We also need to get othe peoples oppinion on this, such as the elderly. So yes, I do think think driverless cars are a good idea, and hopefully one day soon they will be a part of this world.

378b941,"From Luke's piont of view covincing others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

There are three reasons why you and others should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One of them is taking care of animals, the other one is having unbelievable trips, the last one is the jobs you do and the free time.

The first one were going to talk about are taking care of the animals.

When you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you have to care the horses until they go to a different person.

Another supporting detail is about the cows, you need the cows to get the milk from or what are the others participates going to drink.

The last supporting detail is the mules that were shipped overseas.

Those were all the supporting details for the reason about taking care of animals.

The other reason that were going to support is the unbelievable trips they travel by.

The first supporting detail is about the cattle-boat trips they get when they participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Also, we get to tour an excavated castle in Crete.

they also marveled at the Panama Canal on there way to China. That is another reason why you and the others should participate.

The other reason you should join is you got to do many jobs so you won't be bored, and you also get free time.

One job you get is being a night watchman you get to check on all the animals every hour.

Another one is cleaning up. You have to feed and water the animals two or three times. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship, and also the stalls had to be cleaned.

Those were all the reasons and supporting details of why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

There were three things to support my reasons in each paragraph.

That is why people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.",3
4347687,"The develop of the driverless cars is not a good idea. In the article ""Driverless cars are coming,"" there is more negative outcomes about this idea. Driving for some people may be boring and very hard to stay awake when driving. It's better to control your own car then to get into an accident because your car didn't drive right or something bad happened. I think this idea of driverless cars is not good for our future.

There may be some positive things about a driverless car. Like it can drive for a long time and you don't have to control it. In the text,"" The car can handle driving functions at speeds of 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold on the wheel."" Meaning the car will drive for a long time only if the driver has his hand on the wheel. But what if they don't they might end up in a crash or something worst. Another thing is that it tells you when you need to control it again. In the text it says,"" GM had developed driver's seats that vibrate attention whenever a problem occurs."" That's good even though there can be bad things about that. Especially if the driver is not paying attention.

In the other hand, the idea of driverless cars has more negative parts about it. For example the drivers need to be attective just incase they need to drive the car. In the text it says,"" This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" Which means the driver must always have their attention on the road if they are not driving. Another thing is that as a driver you must drive when you near accident sight or a traffic area. in the text,"" they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues.""The cars may control themselves but when there is a accident or traffic the owner must drive it which isn't really nice.If an accident happens the owner can be accused. In the text,"" If the technology fails and someone is injuried, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer."" That is not good at all because it may not be the owner's fault but he still gonna get accused of the accident.

Having a driverless is not a really good idea at all. The car may control itself but there's still times when a driver needs to control it. Some people are to busy yelling at their kids, changing their kids diapers, getting ready for work, and texting on their phone. They are not going to have time to control the car just because it can't drive through areas where they is accidents. They bought the car because it drives by itself, not to drive when it was in a bad area. In the text it says,"" This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" People may not have the time or be ready to driver leading them to a accident or worst.

The idea of having driverless cars is not a good idea. It may have some good things about the car but there is more negative things to the idea of a driveless car. Not everyone has the time to drive the car when it needs to be controlled. Having driveless cars is not good it may cause more accidents or other problems. ",4
f7a6888,"The future is much closer than we think. Imagine being able to drive a car without actually driving it. Many different manufacturers have been looking for ways to make this possible. Driverless cars would be good for reducing gas usage, making driving easier, and bringing the things scientist do to a whole new level. Caring about our Earth is just one very close step we need to take.

Driverless cars would be good for reducing gas usage all around the world. In many places, people spend a large percent of their income on paying for gas alone. By introducing driverless cars, people wouldn't really need to have their own cars. So they wouldn't need to pay for the gas. In recent years, global warming has become a big topic of discussion; by eliminating almost half of the gas usage this creates much safer air that isn't warming up the atmosphere. Something like this could be the first tiny step in avoiding global warming from actually happening. Ideas like this are what will make smarter cars a very good option to turn to in the near future.

Looking towards more personal matters, driverless cars would also make driving much easier for many people. Many people suffer from things that could make it hard for them to drive. Some may not be able to see at night, or just be bad at driving. The driverless car would take care of everything for you. Only requiring the human to drive on roads of serious construction or car accidents. It would also prevent you from being lost. If the car already knows where to drive there's a very small chance you'll end up at the wrong place or lost. These cars could also be used on very long car trips. Once something like this gets approved and all of the bugs are gone, you could use this to travel long places in a car. Say Californina to New York, only needing to take over when there's construction. The more advanced these cars become the more likely people will start to accept them.

Science is getting more and more important over the years, and this could be a good way to get people more on board with science. Something like this in science has never been done before, and couldn't be done. Founder of Google Car project, Sebastian Thurn, said ""There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting..."" This is very new to science and it's something that could encourage many people questioning what they want to do, to maybe try to be apart of science. Education is so important nowadays and this could encourage someone that maybe this project is for them. This could bring many jobs to upcoming scientists and people who become attracted to science after an idea like this could be possible. While also providing jobs for people who need to make the cars. Smarter cars are great for bringing science to a new level, which is what we should do.

Smarter cars would be a great idea for our future. They would be good for reducing gas, making driving easier, and taking science to a whole new level. This could reduce global problems, personal problems, and create new jobs for people getting interseted in science. Caring about the Earth and actually doing something for the Earth are very different. If you're someone who wants to take care of the Earth, this is an amzaing idea I think you should really consider. ",5
d31b83c,"This could be very vaulable. It could change the way things are being taught in class, when a student is bored the computer could pick up on it and find a way to make it more fun, also while letting teacher's know how their student's are feeling so they can find ways to make the class more upbeat and fun to learn in.

This techonlogy could be very useful to teacher's and students alike.

Teacher's could understand how their student's are feeling and find way to help them and figure out what it is they need, and how soon they need it.

Some student's are not very open, with their emotions or even their home life, this could help teacher's help student's that may be in need of social servies and such. With that being said, yes this could be very useful to other's and provide how student's feel in a class room on a daily bases. Even though, some may think that, that is the most stupiest thing ever to be told. Nobody in this day and age is very open with each other, they all feel the need to be one man for himself, nobody cares about how anyone else might feel, not even younger teachers, they think that because they are older they are more vauble and whatever they do is correct, if soemone who truly cared about their job, had techonogly like this. I feel they would be all means use this in the best way possible. Student's would have more fun and interesting school days, they would have more to come home and tell their parent's about all the cool and intresting stuff they learned that week and how their teacher's made them feel very welcomed and at home. Instead in 2018, almost every student is tested and made to feel dumb because all of these test, that are pushed on them, they won't remember tomorrow because it won't be something that's important.

In conclusion, school doesn't come easy to everyone. Some students really struggle but won't speak up because some teacher's and other student's make them feel stupid and that, they shouldn't be there. I think this techonogly would further help teachers, maybe, just maybe understand their own student's.

cc751c6,"Although a motorized vehicle provides the opportunity to transport citizens from place to place, limiting the usage of a car may be considered more beneficial. Car usage limitations allow the citizens to feel less stressed, show a decrease in air pollution and a promotion towards alternative transportation, and a decrease in habit.

The article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" (Source One), suburban pioneers have decided to permently give up cars. Although the usage of cars are generally forbidden in Vauban, its fellow citizens express that they were ""always tense... [are] much happier this way"" without the use of a car in their lives. When individuals are stressed, they're constantly worrying and not fully paying attention to surroundings; therefore, stress is considered one of the causes of vehicle crashes. Also, the congestion of traffic (if not awful enough already) will become worse with the crash which causes more individuals to become stressedl. Without the use of cars, citizens are less stressed and can go about their daily lives. Vauban is considered to be ""the most advanced experiment in low-car suburband life"" because of the attempt to make the city denser and a better place for walking has succeed.

""Paris bans driving due to smog"" (Source Two), mainly focuses on the environmental issues that car usage has been causing throughout the city. After a near-record, pollution, Paris strictly enforced a driving ban to ""clear the air of the global city"". The smog from the motorized vehicles is hazardous to our environment which therefore can be damaging to us and our bodies if we only inhale smog. Therefore, health problems are presented among the population and causes an endless loop of health concerns to be dealt with. These can be considered ""solved"" if the environmental issues are presented and dealt with immediately and effectively. Luckily, with Paris going in the right direction with the ban, health concerns will decrease as well as the smog in the air. Because of the ban that Paris has plaaced, congestion was ""down 60 percent in the capital of France"". Presented later, the smog in the city has began to clear enough. Two beneficial causes have been brought forth all because of limitations on the usage of cars.

""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" (Source Three),  explains how Bogota has a dedication day to the use without cars. According to a business man, Carlos Arturo, he explains how the day of dedication relieves stress and lowers the pollution. In order to transport oneself from place to place, citizens can walk or ride bicycles. Because of the large impact that Bogota has made, ""municipal authorites from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic"". In summary, this city has made quite an influencial mark on others. With prediction, this event could end up carrying throughout the world because of the incredible benefit that it has on our planet: the decrease of air pollution. It not only helps us, but it provides help to the world. Another article, ""The End of Car Culture"" (Source 4), explains that a study has been made on the American drivers: ""... are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". If this pattern continues, it'll provide implications for carbon emissions and the environment, seeing as ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"". If we could reduce this, our lives and breathing conditions can be improved dramatically. The quote, ""people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit"", means that if we can break the habit of buying cars, there will be no more habit to continue with.

In conclusion, the reduction and limitations of car usage will not only be beneficial to us, but it'll become greatly beneficial to our environment; which becomes an endless loop of helping one another out.    ",4

By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Lukes favriot thing was seeing the Acropolis in Greece. Luke also took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. Luke had a lot of work like clean the stables feed the horses two or three times a day. Luke also found time to have fun on borad, especiallyon the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

As I got to the end of the reading my thoughts were more near the negtive side than the positive side. I mean the world today is and always will be coming up with newer things, but I personally feel that we are taking, ""The sky is our only limit,"" a little too far.

In the artical, Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver admits,"" We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" Today almost everywhere you go, you happen to hear about people texting and driving, which produces the trama of an innocent life being taken away because of some little thing that distracts a majority of us today. How are we supposed to introduce this ""fun new way of driving"", when there are people who aren't even responsible to drive on the road the right way? Some may say, ""Well that's another good reason for driverless cars!"", but in reality, it's not.

Also a question that is stated in the artical is,""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacture?"" that question right there is also a major scare to a lot of us in society. On a day to day basis, we are dealing with wars in third world countries, people dying because of hunger, a new disease that can wipe out any country, and so many more things that an everyday individual doesn't even know about or think about. Introducing a driverless car, will only add to that stress and drama. Most people would say that it's another bad idea that car manucturers have pitched.

Finally I'd like to say, It may sound like I'm bashing this entire idea, but really I'm just thinking about it realistically. Another statement that supports my argument is that television and movies have long been fascinated with the cars that could drive themselves. Another projection that many could inturprut the wrong way, especially new drivers. Teens today see crazy things done in movies and/or television shows and go and say,""Well if that actor can do it, so can I!"" If they see a driverless car, who knows what's going to happen.

In conclusion, driverless cars aren't the best idea. Throughout the entire artical there are roadblocks and warning signs that show, diverless cars are simpily a pleasure and not a neccesity. Therefore the idea of driverless cars isn't so great.               ",3
8e65d52,"I'm against this car idea. So many people get hurt or even killed because of technology and trying to put technology in a car would just make it worse. Yes it would be better on gas because it would be electric, but thats the only positive thing I see out of this. Like the article says ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?"" Someting like this could start a lot of fights with car companys and inserince. I would be easy to blame the car because of ""tech problems"" so the car company looks bad to other people. So the car company losses custemers. The car always needs a real human to drive the car. Yes the car can be quick, but what if the car just swerves off the rode so many people would get hurt from a car thats doesnt have a human drining the car. People hate when there kids text and drive. Why would a parent what there kid having a car that drives it self and just full of technology? That just make the parents more nevers for there kid to go out on any day. Plus people tht arent good with technology in the frist place and they get a car like that that would be crazy. To have some one who can't use a high tech phone like the Iphone would be unsafe to the world. If the world had a car that didn't need a human driver a lot of taxi drivers would loss out of a job. The only reason they got the job because they can't do school very well, so their last resort was to become a taxi driver. With these cars people would losse thier jobs. So thats all the reasons that I think about the cars I don't think we should have them it just to risky.",3
dae9832,"The face of mars is a discovery of the centary because our spacecrart from nasa captured a strange object from 1976- 2001. Since then nasa has been doing more and more research on this strange object on mars. We took a clear photo of the object and it appeard to be a face, looking straight at our spacecraft.

Scientists figured that the face had unusual shadows that made it look, like an Egyption pharaoh. A few days later NASA wanted to unveil the image for the whole world to see, they exlained the face of mars on movies, tv shows, magazines, and radio talk shows. People thought that the foce of mars was created by an alien space craft or an alien ship has crash land on to, mars to make ith look like a face. NASA is wishing that there could be an ancient civilization on mars, that NASA dosn't know about.

Days later web surfers have provine that the was no alien monument after all I claim that there is no face on mars. I beleive that there are shadows, on mars that make it look like a face i argue that there was no, alien monument on mars that it is just a illusion caused from the shadows on mars. this face on mars could just be another Martian mesa which are usually common enough in cydonia.

5e41d79,"Limiting car usage can have many beneficial outcomes for the environment around us. Avoiding car usage will drastically lower greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, cut pollution in big cities, and make rush-hour easier for human beings.

The first thing that decreasing car usage will do is that it will lower our greenhouse gas emissions. In Source 1: ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Rosenthal explained that because automobiles are very neccessary to middle-class families all around the world,""it is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes..."". Without cars there wouldn't be so many greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and global-warming could be evaded much easier. According to Source 4: ""The End of Car Culture"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Rosenthal again shows information which states that, because recent studies suggest Americans are using fewer cars, ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior"". With less and less Americans getting licenses and buying cars, greenhouses gases will start plummeting at a faster rate than ever before.

Also, lowering the use of cars will decrease pollution in big cities which are usually sorrounded by clouds of smoke. From the information in Source 2: ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", by Robert Duffer, Duffer said that because of the amount of congestion in the city of Paris, ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". Paris could have easily avoided the ban on driving if they stopped using cars so much, which would in turn decrease the amount of pollution in the sky. There was a similar situation in Source 3: ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", by Andrew Selsky, where in Bogota, Colombia the government created a car-free day where no cars were used at all and people like Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman, said that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"". Another big city is lowering their amount of pollution as well just because they are using cars less.

In addition, an environment less reliant on automobiles creates easier traffic and a more relaxing road to travel upon. In Source 1, a media trainer and mother of two called Heidrun Walter, recalled that ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"". Now, more people won't have the same stress they had in the morning when they had to worry about the amount of cars on the road. In Source 4, Selsky explained that the new car-free day will be ""leaving the sreets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"". Without the everyday clutter of cars, streets will easily be more open and easier to drive upon.

Although limiting car use seems a bit distant at the moment and very hard to accomplish all around the world, with less cars there will be less greenhouse gases, pollution, and traffic on the road.                                         ",4
e4c81e7,"NASA has gotten so many questions about this face on mars. Is it created by aliens , is it a sign ? So many question unanswered to world about this face made about the unknown. People have wanted answers and

I'm a NASA scientist will give it to them as truthful as I can.

First question , Is this face made by aliens ? Most common question of all , NASA isn't really for sure if aliens made this becuase we still don't have proof of alien life or life on Mars. We haven't went to down on Mars to detect it or scan it . See if it was a rock formed by Mars itself or was it just there before and we haven't noticed it .

Next question, Is this an sign by the unknown and if it is what would earth do

or NASA ? NASA has already think that

this face remind this of a natural landform on earth but we are not sure if this is an sign from what you may call it the unknown. If is was an sign from the unknow , we would probably go check it out and see if there any life on Mars form this to appear.

Finally question , Do you NASA scientist believe that Mars made this on it own ? Mars could have made this on it own, but we are going with that thorie until we go check it out scan it , run test the whole nine yard before we go with something we are not sure about . Mars have made rock own it own before or it can be just an meator land then and made it.             ",1
c190ff7,"When you're thinking of the future, you are probably thinking of new technology.

Cars are going to be one of the biggest advances in technology withing the next couple of years.

Scientists have been working on these prototype cars that can drive themselves.

There are very many reasons that they have been coming up with this new idea.

First order of business is that with this new invention, there will be a lot less accidents on the roads.

The cars can save a lot of money that is washed away every year through drivers ed classes for teens.

It will be a safer environment for beginner drivers.

Instead of being fully in control, and being fully liable for an accident, the car will be the one in charge.

This car saves money, and saves lives.

Drinking and driving, this is a very familiar phrase to people nowadays.

This phrase does not bring joy, but brings out the worst in people.

There are over 100,000 accidents every year due to drunk driving.

So many lives are lost due to the lack of intelligence these people have.

With this car you will not have to deal with the stupidity of these people, you will not have to deal with worrying about a loved one coming home safely, these cars save families.

Texting and driving, another phrase among with brings sullen faces.

As a teenager, your life revolves around your phone.

Again, the stastics do not lie when they say that one of the top learders in death is due to automobile accients.

You know why there are so many automobile accidents?

Another characteristic of ruthless behavior.

With these self driving cars, you can text will the cars drives.

It is a win-win situation.

A lot of people take roadtrips.

Typically the people will take turns at the wheel, but of course, there is always that one that gets stuck with the night shift.

I do not believe anyone would care to be driving instead of getting a good nights rest.

You will save tons of money on going to hotels, because these cars drive for you at night while you get to sleep.

With these cars, they'll do the driving for you, you save money, and you get to your destination faster.

My fourth, and final statement is that technology is advancing more and more every day, one day we will have these self driving automobiles.

We might as well start know and get to know how to use them and learn their strenghts and weaknessess sooner rather than later.

Our kids will look back on how we used to actually drive ourself and be flaberghasted at the thought of that.

We will have to satisfaction of knowing that our children are safer on the roads with these cars.

In conclusion, these cars are the future of driving.

Whethere we like it or not, we will just have to deal with it.

You have to look at the positives of the situation, which overrule the negatives.

These cars are safer, and more reliable than the average car.

They are the car of tomorrow. ",2
f6ae317,"I think that having driverless cars would be fun yeah, but i dont know if i would trust them at all times. Like what if you wanted to go to sleep? Would you trust a car with your family, or friends in it? I dont know if i would completly trust a car to get me where i want to be without it wrecking. I mean yeah i guess you can trust the smart people who made it, but i don't know if you could fully trust the car itself. Anything could go wrong.

My opinon is my opinon, other people may think differntly. But oh well. Most people would probaly buy this exspensive car just to look cool, but i mean would you rahter risk your safety? I dont know if i would. I mean look at all the people who do drugs, and other things just to look cool. They risk their lives, waist their money, and time just to impress somebody else. That's stupid! People can take over when they want to, so i think that that's kind of good to be able to have that protection. If somethings going wrong, then the car would make noises basically saying "" hey something wrong here"".

I think its honestly up to the people, and how they feel about getting in a car that drives on its own. Yes, i kind of do think it would be fun to be able to have a car drive me, but on the other hand, it would be kind of scary too. There are some reasons why i'd pick to own one. I would own one, because they would be nice to own. It'd be interesting too! I think i could get use to having a car driving me around. Another reason why i think people would perchase this car, is to have it drive them home, or around place to place when they can't drive because they are drunk. I think that's smart really, because their not risking other people lives, when their out getting drunk, and try to drive themselves home. So yeah im 50/50 about driverless cars. I kind of have my opinon on owning one, and not owning them. So im not really against it, and im not fully sure about ever owning one. If the world decides to drive driveless cars, then i'd probally be more willing to own one myslef. I think i'd rather see how driverless cars go with other people before i purchase one. That would be smart to watch before you waist your money on smomething that might break, or you could possibly get hurt by or die in. I'd rahher be able to trust the car a little more, and see how things go, before i accually buy one for myself.        ",2
4867a46,"the author supports this idea because venus has many mysterious questions that we need to figure it out. the athor even tells what kind of vehicle and tools to use if venus itself had plants,water,and even animals.the author even said that earth and venus were almost identicle in past billions of years.in the past years we tried to seek the mysteries of venus by using technology,vehichles,and probes just to see what happened to venus when it was processing life.

even scientists doing further visits to its surface and Astronomers are facinated by venus.NASA are still working on other approaches to studying Venus.plus were still curious about venus and its like a challenge for us.sure its dangerous to set foot in venus but that takes away the fun and our curiosity.plus the author says that venus was Earth's ""twin"" because Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like earth.venus even have simularities to earth like valleys,mountains,and craters.

f46ea2c,"How challenging it is exploring venus? Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. Sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to venus. on other planets surface temperatures are way to high they are over 800 degrees which is really bad for human being to be up there. Taking electronics up to thoes plants would melt them.

In Vensus the teampeture is really high and it most likely human being or anything thing in general could live up there because of how high the teampeture is which is 800 degrees. NASA workers are studying Venus but they cant really work on it because anything that lands in Venus will just melt because of how hot it is up there. Nobody has gone up there in three decades. Earth is sometimes closer to mar and sometimes closer to Vensus depending on how fast they are going. NASA is working on something to last longer up there instead of melting so they can get more information on whts going up their instead of sending people out there and dying just to get information back.

The atmospheric presure is 90 times greater than what we are used to on our planet.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. The most challenging part is that the clouds of high corrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere.

I strongly belive that they shouln't really be worried about Venus because we already know a little bit about it and we already know we arre not gonna be able to grow stuff up their or be able to live up their so NASA shouldn't be foucs in that. So how challenging is it to explore vensus?",2

e5565a7,"Dear Mr. Senator,

My name is Jacob and I would like to discuss with you some of the problems with the way the presidential election works. I believe the system using the Electoral College is unfair and can have its negative outcomes. In my opinion, the President should be chosen through the popular vote. There have been several times to date where presidents have one the popular vote but still lost the election due to the Electoral college. Often the President will have won by both Electoral votes and the popular votes but that isnt always the case. The electoral which has 538 electors are people as well. What is to stop them from voting who they want and not what the popular vote says in that state? They are people that are put in a position of power to choose who the next president will be. The obvious choice would be for them to pick who they want as president. Voters may also get confused about how the system works. They may thinkn that their vote doesnt count, that only the electors votes count. I believe that using a system where the popular vote is what chooses the election. This can solve several problems such as confusion and biased electors. If people felt that their vote counted, they might even want to get more involved.

Sincerely,

Jacob    ",3

All of us together make 44 nations that have joined together to help the people in need. The Seagoing Cowboys were part of the UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) organization. A Seagoing Cowboy will take care of the animals including the horses, young cows, and mules that are on board. You get to see amazing monuments and you get to sight see and have fun. This is an opportunity of a lifetime so you should join this amazing program.

One of the reasons that you should join the program is because while you are working, you get to enjoy the wonderful views that the ocean gives you and you get to see building that you would have to pay a lot of money for. I got to see Europe, China, and the Acropolis in Greece. When you are having a bad day you can just look out and see the beautiful sunset and marvel the sights that you can look upon.

Another reason is once the animals are unloaded, you are able to find some time to yourself and have fun on the ship. You are able to play baseball, volleyball, and tennis. The Cowboys also did fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to pass time. You would find an empty stable and gather a few people to play with you.

Plus the they sent to mars was just taking pictures of a landing site for viking 1's sister viking 2. The first time they saw the face was when it was all shadowy so you could barely see it but as time past by it was 1998 when they went back up to mars with oe of the vikings to take another picture and it was more clear. They had to 12 years to go back up to mars and I dont think that aliens could build it that fast, it would've at least taken more time to make a good face. Then at the year 2001 they took another picture and it was fading away and I honestly dont think that the aliens would be able to take the face down that fast and why would they have to take it down. It has to be natural because there are no suh things as aliens, because no one from nasa has ever seen one and if they would've Nasa would've told everybody that they have found aliens and that they are real. Also I know its natural because even nasa said that the face had a nose,eyes,mouth, and looked exactly like a humans face.

f5ff900,"Can less driving or having no car at all help you and the Earth? In this eassy it will review how an experiment in Germany and many other plasces are trying to have car-free cites. Also how in Paris, France they try to ban cars because of so much smog and air pollution. Last it will review, car-free day in Bogota, Colombia.

In Germany on the out skirts of Freibury, there was an experiment for a community to have less cars. Many people who moved there said that it changed their lives in a very good way. Many people sold their car just so that they could have enough money to buy a house in the car-free strees of Vauban. Only very few people have a car because you have to buy a $40,000 car garage to keep your car. As a result of the really high price, 70% of people dont own a car, which is helping the pollution rate go down. The community is home to over 5,500 car-less people. Finally, some other countries have even deicided to take on this action to help the pollution rate go down.

Next, in Paris, France on a Monday Paris enfored a partial driving ban in order to help smog and/or pollution rates go down. People who were caught driving were given a 22-eurofine ($31 US), which then unfortunatly almost 4,000 people were fined the ticket. Even almost about 30 people had their car impounded for having a bad reaction over the small fine. On the good side, the traffic was down 60% in Paris. They kept blaming diesel engines becase about 67% of vehicles in France are diesel. Finally, due to giving free public transit, they did the parcial ban the next day.

Bogota, Colombia starts a car-free day, that even spreads to other countries. During the car-free day, millions of people hicked, biked, skated or even took the pubic bus to work. The goal of this is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog and/or pollution. On the car-free day only buses and taxies were the only ones able to drive, anyone who violated the rule was fined $25. Even a businessman said, "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The event was so great and powerful, people from other countries were comimg to celebrate too. Last, The car free day has been a major improvment since the mid-1990s, bicyle paths have been constructed and even many sidewalks have been replaced with newer ones too.

In conclusion, it is belived that the car culture is slowly coming to an end. As each year goes by less and less people are getting cars, licenses, and/or even driving much less. in America, in 2013 the number of miles driven per person was down but 9% than of 1995. Many people are now car-pooling which has a result in less cars being used to go to the same place. Last, even a study show from 2001 to 2009 young people driving decreased by 23%.    ",3

Like i was saying i was driving and next thing you know BOOM!! I collided with a nasty old rusty out fo style truckand ruine my car. I called 1800-411-pain and they will handle it. I guess i have usage for this car anymore and I can just walk. my point i""m making is that you don't need a car to get you where you go all the time. citizens can use other sources of transportations. Citizens need to take advantages of limting car usage for the u. s. and the world. i'm going to i'm inform citizens about advantages of limiting car usage.

First of all, a lot of citizens love their cars like i did. What some citizens don't know that cars are dangrous. Well I think everybody know that because of all the accidents and crash but I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the pollutions. That the air is being polluted. Secondly, That is not the only thing. Riding bikes, walking, taking the bus, and taking a cab can help stop pollution. Now I'm not talking about taking away all cars. We have to take advantages of limiting the car usage.

Honestly, walking is not that bad and so is riding a bike. It is really good workout. It is also safer than cars if you don't trip or fall off your bike.

Also citizens won't cause congestion. Citizens don't also have pay bill and loans for their cars if you don't have one. Now i know some people have job to get to, so all you have to do is to wake up early for work ride a bike or take the bus arrive to work on time. If you was late and something comes up just make up a lie about why you are. At least you are helping out the world. Most of all, when you drive a car then a cop stops you and give you a ticket even though you didn't do nothing wrong. You can avoid that by just taking a bus. Also going to waste money on gas and the bus only 2 dollars. Like I said I'm saying that you should get rid of your car. i'm saying take advantage of limiting car usage.

Venus is extremely dangerous because of it's hot temperatures that can average 800 degrees farenheit.But there are many things astronomers can learn about venus. The astronomers could learn how close the density and size of venus is to earth.They could see why carbon dixiode blankets venus if there is no form of life there.They could test what things will melt on venus.Lastly,they could find out why there are no longer oceans on venus.

Venus is the Earth's twin acording to the author,venus is the closet planet to earth in terms of density and size.The astronomers could examine why 97 percent of carbon dixiode blankets venus.They could go to diferent parts of venus and see if the temeperature rises or lowers due to the high temperatures on venus.They could see how long it will take venus to destory a vehicle used to tavel to venus.They could see what metals will melt on venus so they could use osmething else on the ship that will not melt.Finally,those are all the reasons astronomers should explore venus.

In all based on the evidence venus seems like a worthy pursuit.there will be many great things that will come out of a trip to venus.Astronomers will have more knowledge to share about venus.People could get their questions about venus answered.In conclusion,that is why venus is a worthy pursuit.",3
4c133e4,"Throughout Americas history, people have always owned cars. They use them to travel into the city or long distances. But now it looks as if the tides may be turning for automobiles. Studies have shown that car ownership and average miles driven by citizens have decreased dramatically in the past ten years. Not only is the the case for the United States, but all around the world.

Cars every year release emissions that are harmful to the enviroment. The emissions pollute crowded cities, which makes it dangerous for citizens to live there. In Paris, days of near-record pollutuion made the city partially ban driving for two days. Even number license plates wouldn't drive on one chosen day and odd numbered the next. If the citzens did not comply to this, they were fined twenty two euros. Four thousand drivers had to pay that fine for not leaving their vehicles at home. The other citizens that did comply with the city helped dramtically reduce the smog in Paris. And during the partial driving ban, congestion was down nearly sixty percent.

The decrease in automobile use is not only being used to decrease pollution, people also say that not driving a vehicle helps reduce stress. Heidrun Walter of Vauban, Germany said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". She lives in Germany's experimental suburb that is ""car free"". Automobiles are not banned in this area, per say. But if you want to own a vehicle in this neighborhood, you must buy a parking spot for 40,000 dollars and a home. This neighboorhood is helping shape the way for a future wihtout cars.

One of the main benefits that would directly improve the qaulity of life for humans by decreasing car usage would be exercise. Obesity in the world, especially in America, has been an evergrowing problem in the past twenty years. People have become so busy in their lives where exercise is not one of their top priorities. Without the use of automobiles, citizens would have to either walk, bike, skate, or jog to their destination. This way they would exercise while traveling, wherever that may be.

Overall, the world is preparing for an inspirational future without cars. This would help the world in many areas like Paris or Hong Kong for decreasing pollution or help America with the battle against obesity. No one can predict the future, whether it contains automobiles or not. But the world is certainly becoming less dependant on them, who knows, one day they may become obsolete.    ",3
6ed8d86,"With the new technology coming upon society, there are many new ideas coming abroad. There have been companies promoting the idea of a

""smart car"" that is driverless. The idea has sparked arguements whether or not the idea is actually smart or may cause more issues. My opinion on the idea is that smart cars are a good idea because they can replace taxis and would be cheaper and convienent, could relatively be more safe than a regular driver, and that it's still not totally driverless.

The smart car would be cheaper because, in the article it says, ""The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis..."" So by that statement it would cost less and actually polute less. It also would be alot more convient. The article says, ""Offer more flexibility than a bus."" Which many people around the world use daily. So this idea would be more convienent for the people so they could travel easier and cheaper to where they need to go.

Google has had a car that could drive by itself since 2009. In the article it says, ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" So that proves that the smart cars could relatively be more safe . Also in the article it says, ""They needed a whole lot of sensors."" Which includes, ""Position-estamating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and a inertial motion sensor."" After that big list could u still doubt that it is not safe. I am sure they will even add more sensors in the future to be safer .

Even if u dont want to rely on the smart car to do everything it is not totally driverless. The smart cars require you to be on standby and ready to take control when it is needed. In the article it says, ""Special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel.""

There have been many ideas on how to keep the driver more alert from announcing that the driver needs to take control to flashing lights on the windshield.

With all these reasons combined and more I beleive that a driverless vehicle should be in the future , readily available for the public. ",3

56e11a2,"Have you ever wanted to know exactly how somone is feeling? What if you were telling your friend a story and you truly wanted to know if they found it interesting? The latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe can detect the emotions of someone by calculating the way the subject's facial structure and muscles form the six basic emotions, which are happiness, surpries, anger, disgust, and fear. This system is called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and can be used for many different reasons. One example is in the cassroom. With the FACS, teachers will be able to read the emotional state of their students, plan/adjust lessons based on the readings, and bring a happier, more interesting experience to the classroom.

The FACS has the ability to read emotions based on muscles and face composition. Tests have been done on one of the most famous paintings in history, ""Mona Lisa"". While this technology can be trivial, as reading a painting-woman's face is not completely productive, it can be helpful towards teachers and students. If the teacher has the ability to truly understand and read their student's emotions, the teacher can switch up and have the ability to try something new. For example, if a student's structure reads that (s)he is confused, the teacher can either go more in depth into the lesson and explain further as to avoid any more confusion. This is exactly what Dr. Huang has predicted, saying that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson"" in paragraph 6.

Bringing the FACS into the classroom will not only allow teachers to see how bored and confused their students are, it can force the teacher to be innovative and creative in their lesson plans. If the teacher truly cares for their students' attention, (s)he would have to implement new ways to teach boring subjects, in which most students would clock out of otherwise. Most students dread long lectures and usually either stop paying attention, thus wasting both the teacher's and student's time, or forget most of the information. With the FACS, teachers will be able to detect signs of boredom and dread and then capitalize on their emotions with a new activity or fun game to lighten the students' moods, while also giving them the proper amount of information.

Much like the example above, there are ways for teachers to bring a lighter-toned, more fun energy to the classroom with this system. If the teacher sees that the students are boerd, in a lecture for exapmle, the teacher could implement a game or fun activity. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, as explained in paragraph 9, if someone is putting on a happy face, even if they do not mean it, they are subconciously happy and are having a good time. If the students are doing a fun activity together, they are surely going to smile, giving off positive vibes and general happiness in response to an otherwise boring lesson.

The FACS is a revolutionary way of processing emotions and can be really helpful for any student-teahcer learning environment. The system can allow teachers to read what their students are feeling, and can either hcange a lesson plan to reduce confusion, or implement activities or games to increase happiness and positivity during a dreadful lecture. The FACS in the classroom will help both teachers and students alike.",6
f705dc1,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a recent advancement in technology that can read emotions from facial expressions. Many people speculate where it could be used, from marketing to video games. Some might wonder whether it could be used in classrooms, which is a definitive ""No."" FACS is not valuable to read student's emotional expressions because the classroom shouldn't include emotion, it has better uses elsewhere, and is invasive of privacy.

Emotion shouldn't dictate the lesson in schools. In the passage, Mr. D'Alto quotes, "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" (6). Everyone has walked into class one day, seen the lesson and then silently grumbled to themselves. This type of emotion shouldn't change what the lesson is or how it is taught. The goal of teaching techniques is to effectively teach the broadest audience. This type of system would switch up the lesson for the few people who get confused easily, but then it hurts the majority's learning experience. This is why the classroom shouldn't include emotion.

Systems such as FACS have better economical value elsewhere. In the passage, Mr. D'Alto says, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" (6). This is one example of other industries that could utilize this type of technology. In the classroom, there is no economical value of being able to read the students emotions. Mr. D'Alto goes on to say, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery."" These are other industries that would love FACS-like technology. It's a better investment to use FACS elsewhere other than the classroom.

Privacy is held dear by many. FACS can be invasive of this. Some students may wish to save their grief for a counselor, therapy, or simply a designated time to cry. FACS completely disrespects this fact and exposes an individual to everyone else. In the passage, D'Alto quotes, "" 'Most human communication is nonverbal, uncluding emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too.' "" (6). This quote implies that computers are not yet able to comprehend whether or not the individual wishes to be ""scanned"", for a lack of a better term. This can be invasive. Until technology reaches a point until this changes, FACS should stay out of the classroom where students may not wish to have their emotions expressed involuntarily.

In conclusion, FACS is not only worthless, but harmful to the learning quality of students. This is because it has better uses elsewhere, is a breach of privacy and includes emotion into the classroom. FACS is, and may never be suitable for a classroom environment.",5
c45ff55,"The ""face"" on Mars is indeed a natural landform. The ""face"" could have been formed by multiple things. Such as being hit by other rocks, or it may even be the formation of some kind of sand. A lava dome could be another option of what it is. The picture is sharp enough to catch any living evidence. The article states, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times biggerthan the pixel size,"" (NASA, 12). What they are stating here is that if some kind of living evidence was in the picture they would be able to recognize it instantly.

A so called ""face"" formation on mars, even showed up as a natural landform. as stated in the text,

""a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"" (NASA, 7). What they are stating in that paragraph is that it may have looked like a alien monument but it was never a ""alien monument"", it was just a natural landform. That which could have been made by many different occasions that may have happen. Scientist are always searching for more and more explanations everyday.

If there was any objects in the first picture taken, any sciencetist or any citizen could have noticed the picture was sharp enough to pinpoint any living evidence or so called ""aliens"". Even if there was transportation such as cars airplanes or any shelter as known as ""Egyptian-Style Pyramids"" or even ""Small Shacks"", you would have been able to make out an tell what the objects are. As started from the text ""unmasking the face on mars"", ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egytian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were"" (NASA, 12)!

The so called ""face"" on the planet ""Cydonia"" could have been formed by lava and may even be a ""lava dome"". Yeah some people qont always agree with the evidence, but you have to look at the facts. You also might not agree there is lava on the planet Cydonia but honestly tell me have you ever been to Cydonia to prove to me 100%, aliens made the monument and its not a natural landform? once you show me that proof ill take another look and maybe turn my point of veiw from your side. Until then ill believe its a lava dome or some kind of natural resource. As stated in ""unmasking the face on mars"", ""What the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.""it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,""says garvin"" (NASA,12) what they are saying is the ""face"" is a natural landform which they can compare to many different landform and monuments on earth.

NASA can compare the so called ""face on the red planet"" to many different things on earth. They can compare height, shape, color, texture, etc. as stated in ""unmasking the face on mars"", ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars""(NASA, 12) In that evidence from the text they are saying they can take the height and compare it to the Face on Mars and it will be almost exactly the same. I believe the ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform, not every person in the world may agree but if you look at the facts and evidence together you will be able to comprehend the ""Face"" is not an aliens monument, it is a natural landform.",4

The car industry is ah huge industry , racking up billions every year but now there to start something new that will take the world by storm and the car industry will changed as we know it . The driveless car. People beileve this is what america and the world needs, but is it really?

In the late 1950s, General motors created a concept car that could run on a

special test track. the track was embedded with an electrical cable that send radio signals to receiver on the front of the car. engineerd at berkeley tried something with magnets with alternating polarity. This lead to the all luxury , well balcned , and smarter cars of today ,but can they get even smarter ? Srbastian thrun , founder of the Google car project , believes that the technology has finally caught up to began his dream. But before 2000, ""there was no way"" said thrun , to make something interesting . but now he is on his way to his dream , but is that dream reallt needed and was it safe as well.

In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""traffic Jam assistant"". The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch srnsors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. n fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. they can steer , accelerate , and brake themselves, but allare deigned to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills , such as navigating through work zones and around accidents .

49ef06a,"I think that the Electoral College is a bad way of picking a president, because as Americans , we have the freedom of speech and that should include voting as well. the Electoral College system works and for some states it ""fits the shoe,"" for example California, they have 55 representatives .

The Electoral College allows the electoral votes to be given out by the voters and the population in that state may never actually honestly choose who they want in office . in other cases itthe presidential canidates have  more intrest in the bigger states such as Florida. that could boost in the jobs, and advanteges in the bigger states.

In defense of the Electoral College , it can be a faster way to elect a new president , it also allows people to lose intrest since their votes don't effect much in the long run. the votes of the people should effect who should be in office because with what I know about the Electoral College, it could break a country. It takes away freedom of speech. But helps the canidate(s) from your state , which can possibly help your state in the long run .

The popular votes allows you to choose who you want to be in office and if the person you voted for lost , at least you had your vote. You can easily have had you vote given to someone and they could have had cheated you out .

If the Electoral College is kept going then there should be some changes to how it is done. For example , the small states have less say in what happens compaired to the bigger states like California and Florida . It should balance out so that it can be fair but also equaled out.                            ",3
dc02c32,"Thomas Huang has created an software that can recongnize your emotions from an computer and I dont think its a good or bad idea. Here are some why its not valuable.

People shouldnt always know how others feel. They shouldnt have to be worried about if a computer knows there sad or not. Most students come to class to get away from there emotions so why would you bring them back up?

Although this computer could be valuable in some ways like helping your friend feel happy. As they said in the passage "" it could recognize when a student is becoming confused and bored"" which would get them back on track. It also modifies the lesson for you. Making it easier on the person that is on the computer.

So is the emtional expressions of students in a classroom valuable? I would have to save thats all up to you. Some people would like others knowing if they are sad or not. Personally I woud not like them knowing I was sad all the time.            ",2
6c762a7,"Our, planet Earth has created landforms in weird shapes and sizes. Could Mars have been capable to sculpture the ""Face on Mars?"" I definitley think so. The ""Face on Mars,"" was not created by aliens. Here are my reasons why.

My first reason is that the face might just be an illusion. According to the article, the ""Face on Mars,"" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter. This is a cloudy time of year. The sun could be making the unusual shadows giving you the illusion. Also the height of the so called ""nose,"" could be making shadows that form the ""eyes,"" tricking theorist, thinking it looks like a face.

My second reason is that there was no form of life seen near this landform. Building the Face could have taken years and years. NASA would probably have witnessed an alien or aliens during the process of construction. No tools or artifacts were left behind. As said in the passage, "" No alien monument at all.""

My last and final reason is that the Face is just another martian equivalent of a bette or mesa. They are very common around the America West. This could have been the case for Mars.

Jim Garvin from the passage says that the Face reminds him of Middle Butte that is the same height as the face.

You might think there is no way Mars could have created the face so percise and accurately. Its is possible that a meterorite could have hit Mar's surface and coincidentally made it look like a face. Earth does have landforms that are odd as well which can go the same for Mars.

Those were my reaons why the Face is just another natural landform. As you can see that ""Face on Mars,""

was not built by aliens. Conspiracy theorist are in a misunderstanding. Aliens may not have been capable to create a human face. Just rethink all the real life facts and dont jump to any conclusions.  ",3
fe6b86c,"Dear. State Senator

Electoral College should we keep it or change it, to election by popular vote? Well alot of people dislike it and some like the electoral college. There are certian asspects about both electoral college and election by popular vote that should be looked at closey before you choose which one works and wich one dosen`t.

Keeping electoral college I believe its best for our voting proccess.

Why because in 2012 Oboma received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes. His percentage with popular vote was 51.3 percent, so if you voted for him electoral college bumped up his percent by a good amount. The electoral college also helps avoid problems of the elections such as no candidat receives a majority of the votes that were cast. Electoral college also restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states lose by vitue of the ma-apportionment, witch means to me that larger states have larger percentages and between the two candidates the percents can be close so the electoral college just helps us pick one of the candidates.

Popular vote has some good asspects to it aswell. Popular vote helps bump up your percentage of votes before electoral college is added, so it makes it an even better chance for the candidate you voted for to win the election. I believe people perfer popular vote because to me if I'm correct popular vote is the amount of votes acandidate got from the people and I know alot of people like it when their choice gets picked and no one else tried to i guess you could say meess with the votes.

Electoral to me is the way to go so I believe you should keep it. It seems that it gives candidates a better chance of their percentage going up so the have a better chance of winning.                                                               ",2
be5caee,"Voting for a President is an extremly big deal and needs to be decided properly. People argue the subject that the Electoral College is unfair opposed to an election that is held by popular vote. However, I disagree. The Electoral College is a process in which the most popular vote gets decided on and goes to Congress for the aproval. Voting for a president is a big deal, especially when the decisson is sealed for four years. The Electoral College has had people question it due to its inncodent in 2000 but overall, it is the best voting option.

Many citizens believe that when they vote that is the final process, no other descissons need to be made, but they are wrong. When qualified citizens vote for a president they also help choose their state's electors. The Electoral College process includes the selection of electors, the vote between who should be President or Vice President and then sent to Congress. Many people argue that the process of the Electoral College is unfair because the electors decide, not the citizens. What people dont understand is the Electoral College are actually deciding for us and thats what makes voters ""iffy.""

Under the Electoral College system, voters vote for the electors that actually decide who the president will be. (Plumer, 10) The issue that gets faced to the voting citizens is they cant control whom their electors vote for. This can be an issue because of whats known as the disaster factor. (Plumer, 11). The most known disaster factor was the big election crisis of 2000. The 2000 campaign was not held very properly, infact seventeen states didnt see the canidates at all. People say that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational but in all actuality it is the best way to vote for who will become president. Bob Dole made the comment ""Abolish the Electoral College!"" but if we had just a popular vote, without Congress having a say in the decisson, the process wouldnt be as organized.

In the year 2000 the Electoral College faced a big issue with the ""fairness"" of the voting process. At the time Al Gore and George W. Bush were running for president but Bush won receiving 271 electoral votes and Gore 266. (Plumer, 1) This made citizens furious because they saw the Electoral College being unfair to voters. Despite that particular campaign, the Electoral College has not shown much faults. All in all the Electoral College process gets the decisons made faster and more efficenty opposed to if it was just by the overall most popular vote.

The argument of the Electoral College method of choosing their president and loosing voters is very popular. Voters knowning their vote will not have any effect, the less voters choose to participate and listen to the campaign. But in all actuality one voters vote will not swich or make the election any different, that is why we have the Electoral College. The Electors make the decison for us, taking the most popular votes and looking them over putting in their extra votes. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" (Posner, 23). Despite the negative views on the Electoral College, it is actually the most organized ""fair"" voting process.    ",4
d6277a3,"In my opinion about the passage ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" i think its a reasonable to give driverless cars a chance. They are many reasonings why i think my opinion matters. In one cass the future is ahead of us and a good part of the world goes with the new and out with the old. Once something new such as driverless cars comes out the buying of regular cars will derease. Television and movies who promote cars will catch the eyes of numerous people which will increase the buying of driverless cars. In the past studys since 2009 drivers less cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash which im my opinion i find fairly good.

Another reasoning behind my opinion is driverless cars has already came a long way they have already made plenty of parts a driverless car needs such as rotating sensor on the roof , video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automative radar sensors, gps receiver and an inertial motion sensor and the most important part a driverless car needs ""spinning sensor on the roof"" what else could go wrong ?

My third reasoning is senors have been around since 1980's and have only inproved since , further improvements in sensors and cumputer hardware and software to make driving safer are leading to cars that can handle driving tasks on their own.

lastly another reasoning is Many people may look at driverless cars as a non fun way to drive since they wait around while a smart car does all the work. There is a positive side of this some people may not see most people tend to text and drive or sometimes call and drive which can lead to accidents even death, with the availbilty of smart cars to drive on thier own would let you do things such things as text and drive with out any leading accidents.

In conclusion for my reasonings , is the fact that taking a chance with driverless cars is a smart thing to do with all the positive outcomes that come with it , Automakers are continuing thier work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be salved ",3
df23b1d,"People do not need cars that can drive themselves. If people were to 'drive' a

car that has the capability to drive by itself.If that same car got in an accident then taht

would mean that the driver is releaing more in the car.

That would also mean that the dirver is not paying attention to the most important thing when driving; the road. Driving laws focus on people safety when people around them are 'driving' and give justice to those who need it; but how can people do that when other would not know who to blame-- the driver or the manucfacturer of that car.

Traffic law was something long ago and it was invented, for human purposes. Majority of people are always careless when driving. Those drivers think that driving is a game and those people don't release their mistake until they have to pay the price. For the actions of those people and for the security and safety of other law where made, specifically driving laws. "" Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe......As a result, in most states it is illgal even to test computer-driven cars"" The author of the article even implies about cars not driving themselves being a concern and even a threat to others. When people make laws they do not do it just for fun. Most states that value their citizens make laws as harsh as they may be to keep people safe. Something everyone mostly people who are parents want for their kids. Parents may not be very happy to see many or even a few drivers distrated because they have a car that drives itself. thay would mostly see it as a threat for their family safety.

Laws change all the time, but just because they change does not mean it always for the best cause or that verything will turn out as people were hoping they would. ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover........-the driver or the manufacturer?""

In this detail the author is implying that if they could change the laws as many time as peoplecould.

The question people should be asking is that will that change anything in the way people would rely on the car. Will the laws decrease the numbers of careless drivers and the amount of accidents cause by those careless drivers. Driving laws would be much harder to control with all of those thing in hand. For example if a person that had a car that could 'drive by itself', which cause the driver to not pay attention to the road. Then the car would start malfunction and cause a huge accident in which cause a life of another. Who would be at fault and the careless driver or the mechanic of the car that malfunction.

Many Television show and movies have invision the future with car that can drive and do other amaxing stuff. Those are pretty cool stuff to do. ""television and movies have long fascinated with cars that could drive themselves."" Now that something to wish for, right? Whrong if you are fascinated with car that could drive themselves that okay, but have theyv stop and look the negative side of this. ""Automakers are .......car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time."" Would sane peron really rely on that 90 percent when there is a 10 percent chance that something could go wrong. If a person values their life when it comes to a surgery which could save their life. Woudn't it be reasonable that person would think twice about putting risk to themselves and even there family. When that a 90 percent chance of not living.

In conclusion people should have fun with things that enginners bring. Though just because it is fun and many peopldo it and look at the consequences that could cause does not mean anyone should rely on it. Remeber that when a person see's a positive that perosn who ever it may be MUST look at the negatives and see if it really worth everything. Is 90 percent really capable of car driving itself. Are traffic laws really going to stop all people and would changing the laws really protect others that are careful and value their lifes? That would be up to the audience.",4

I think our focus should be exploring Mars, I think it's a more realistic mission. The author does have some good evidence to back up on why there's a possibility to explore Venus.

The author said that Venus is Earth's ""twin"" and that is true! Venus is the, ""closest planet to Eartth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."". Venus probably had what Earth has right now which are oceans. Even now, Venus is similar to Earth in terms of surface. The planet has a rocky surface and sediment and also similar valleys, mountains, etc but it's not all good stuff about Venus, the planet also has enviroments that are not suitable for human life and I don't think it will anytime soon in my life time. The author does talk about it and gives facts on why it's hard to explore Venus. It has ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide"". The clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid, the surface of Venus is a flaming 800+ degrees Fahrenheit. That's hot! The pressure alone is 90 times greater than Earth. A submarine accustomed to dive into our deep ocean would be crushed on the Venus surface. We won't be able to see through the thick clouds even if we hovered the planet. Therefore, it would be nearly impossible to et samples of anything!

After all, I think NASA and other private rocket organizations should just focus on going to Mars which like Venus, it's going to be hard. They should see it as a challenge which im sure they do but Mars should be our focus. The author gave good reasons on why we should and shouldn't explore Venus. Which ever planet gets explored first really won't matter. It's history being made for humans and that's what matters in my opinion.",3
e4ff739,"Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system so what made it able to sustain life in the past or even have the qualities that it did? Many scientist ask themselves this question but realize it is too dangerous to find the answer. This author believes that if technology keeps advancing like it is and the innovations keep coming, that one day we will be able to find ways to explore Venus. The author in this article states all the reasons on why we should explore Venus.

The author states that, ""Venus is earths sister,"" he says this because of how closely in shape they are to each other and how close they can become during orbit. Venus has many earth-like qualities that makes us think that it wasn't always as dangerous as it is today. Scientist believe that Venus used to be able to sustain life just like earth and the author gives a great job at telling everyone about it.

With new technologies and innovations scientist will one day be able to see Venus up close. Even though the planets temperature is over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit, scientist believe that we should still explore it because of testing that we can not do from a distance. They believe once we find more out about one planet the more history we will learn from it.

We all hope that one day we can finally find the answers so many people are looking for about Venus. Future innovations will help us in testing when we find a way to figure out all the mysterys of Venus. According to the article, it is extremely dangerous to be close to venus because the atmospheric pressure is 90 times stronger than what we are used to but we still need to find a way down there. No challenges we can not face when it comes to the future because of the advances everyone makes in technology. ",4
c9c5c3b,"Dear Senator Adams,

Voting for a president is not what it seems to be. The electoral college makes the people's votes so that the electors are actually voted. These electors vote for the president in favor of their party which is not always trustworthy or reliable. The popularity winner can also lose, due to lack in electoral votes. Many voters are still confused or don't know how the system works. In reality, electoral system is outdated and should be tweaked of how it would work today.

To begin with, Electors that are voted for by the people are not always trustworthy. They're hand picked by their politcal party but sometimes,""-state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsiblilties are...""(Does The Electoral). Voters can't control who their electors vote for president. The electoral college should be changed to popularity votes because, ""-(the) electors could always defy the will of people""(The Indefensible Electoral). This is unreliable and the way of voting by the people can be easily swayed by the electors.

Additionally, the popularity winner can lose by having less electoral votes. Voters can be discouraged to elect their president when really the electors do the job. This situation has happened when,""-Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes-""(In Defense Of). Any election, voters can expect another close election in which the popular winner could again lose the presidency. The electoral college is unstable and this major downside is a factor.

More over, many voters are still confused or don't know how the system works. In this article it states that, ""-voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate""(The Indefensible Electoral). The electoral college does not clarify to voters on what the people are actually voting for. In another article it explains that people actually voted for a slate of electors. This would mean that the author had to reassure the right understanding. Readers of that article who've voted are now in disbelief or shocked.

In conclusion, the electoral college should be addressed to a win by popularity. The electors in favor of their political party are not always trustworthy. The popularity winner can lose due to lack in electoral votes. Also, many voters are confused or don't know how the electoral college works in presidential elections. These facts add on to more cons than pros of the idea of electoral college.    ",4
b013adf,"When cars were first introduced into society it was the most awestruck phenomenon to occur. There was nothing better than the sight of a person's first car and the feeling of independence that came with it. But now that technology has shorten distances between countries and has made telecommuncation so much more accessible. People should engage in limiting their car usage becuase it betters personal health, improves the enivronment, and leads to economic prosperity while still gaining all the benefits that come from using a car.

When the usage of cars is limited it often leads to better health benefits. This is true becuase when people are restricted on their driving it forces them to resort to healthier, more proactive altertnatives. For example, instead of driving somewhere people are now having to get out and walk or ride a bike. This leads to regular exercise without having to think about it and decreases overall stress levels. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" Heidrum Walter, a media trainer and mother of two explained, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way"". Heidrum, a citizen of the Vauban community in which everyone has given up their cars, describes how the non-usage of cars has bettered her life and in turn has actually made her a happier person. In addition, when a high usage of cars is present it creates brutual smog that can perpetuate health issues. In the aricle ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Robert Duffer states how congestion lead to smog in Beijing in which he states ""Beijing, China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". The impact of this is that when people are more active and choose not to exasterbate their driving usage, it will lead to global decreases in smog and in fat related illnesses such as obesity, high blood plessure, diabetes, and other various things that have plagued the nation and taken the lives of so many people.

Limiting Motor Vehicles usage reduces the amount of carbon emissions and pollution in the air. Cars exert so much greenhouse gas emissions that degrades the air in the environment. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars"" Elisabeth Rosenthal gives the analogy that, ""...an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middles class are choking cities"". Elisabeth Rosenthal further quantifies the extent to which cars have increasing become the culprit of pollution, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"". The impact of this is that when cars are used less often it betters the environment which is what mankind relies on for survival.

An increase in a healthy workforce and better environmental communities leads to greater economic prosperity. When people choose to drive less it often creates a riple effect. This is true because a healthier workforce is present it leads to more productivity. In addition, a more prosperous environment and less pollution exerted decreases operational costs. As a result Andrew Selsky in his article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" explains the various economic effects that less car usage has made, ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city.....and new restaurants and upscale shopping distrcits have cropped up"". The impact of this is that with more economic leverage communities are more equipped to invest and strengthen other areas such as education and job creation.

In conclusion, people should limit their driving and/or car usage because it provides three benefits. First, when people have to resort to proactive alternatives it improves their person health and decreases stress levels. Second, not using cars eliminates all the environmental harms that come from a car such as greenhouse gas emissions. And lastly, when people are more active and the enivronment is no longer depleted, communities experience greater economic longevity.    ",5
9cc68b6,"Venus is like earth with just worser conditions to living. It's the closet planet to earth in terms of density and size. Studying Venus isn't easy. You can not really sample things on the ground there, that's why NASA is trying to come up with new inventions to help us study Venus.

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because if you meet the challenge presented by Venus you see the value of it, it will lead human curiosity into many equally intimidating endeavors.

In paragraph 4 the text states "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth "" this meaning that back then Earth and Venus were some what the same even to now they still are. Venus can be sometimes be the nearest option visit for a planetary visit. When NASA sends humans to study Venus they face hostile conditions on the surface of Venus, and if they go Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. It wont be easy conditions but it is survivable for hor humans. It is good and bad because they are hovering over the ground safetly but at the same time they cant take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Due to trying to study more on Venus, NASA is working on other ways to approach studying Venus.

This is how it is when NASA tries studying for Venus, it's hard for them because when Venus is sometimes around the corner ( in space terms ),humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land. No spacecraft sruvived the landning for more then a few hours. But hopefully they come out with successful ways to study Venus one day.  ",3
aca684e,"The technology to read emotions should not be used in classrooms. The reson I say it shouldnt be used is because in the passage it describes how if your lips tighten up it shows anger, but what if you smile with your lips closed as you are smiling your lips are getting tighter but you are happy and not angry so the emotion reader would be wrong. Anouther reson why the emotion reader shouldnt be in a classroom is because what if you came into school realy sad because someone had just passed away or something you wouldnt want the teacher coming up to you

trying to put this computer in your face trying to tell if your sad or not then you would be mad. I dont feel like people should know the way im feeling by having a computer tell me if someone wants to know the way i am feeling they can look at my face ans see they dont have to have a computer to tell them how im feeling. that is why the emotion readers should not be in a classroom.",2
54765c3,"The face that you seem to see on Mars is just a big misunderstanding. Many conspiracy theorists have made up stories about this face in order to get money and popularity. Even though it is actually just a mesa in the middle of Mars, located in Cydonia. There are many mesas in the western United States and aren't made from any alien race.

This article states that the Face is,""formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This illusion is what conspiracy theorists use to make it viral. It also proves how there is no face at all. It is all just a big shadow of a mesa in Cydonia.

On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. Michael Malin and his team used the Mars Orbiter Camera to take photographs of the face. These photographs were ten times sharper than those of the previous Viking missions. They revealed that is was just a natural mesa and there wasn't anything to do with aliens at all.

April 8, 2001 was a day that completely changed and confirmed that there was nothing more than a mesa in Cydonia. The Mars Orbiter Surveyor can take pictures with one pixel being 1.56 meters, while the early Viking photographs had pixels that were 43 meters. This high definition camera took a picture of the face again. Being able to zoom in up to 3 times larger than the normal picture, the team found out there weren't any structures or figures on the face.

There is plenty of evidence that can prove there isn't anything wrong with the area in Cydonia. Going from high defintion photographs with modern technology to zoom in and spot out evidence or old photos showing shadows of the mesa walls. There are plenty of conspiracies that have been proven false by these photos and research of the NASA workers. This has proven that the Face on Mars was never actually a face or alien structure, but a normal everyday mesa.",3
89dba36,"First, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Venus can have a lot of dangers, since it's closer to the sun and the sun is really hot all 365 days a year. Venus is never going to be like Earth, it has all four types of weather all year around and Venus has only dangerous weathers all year around.

Secondly, a piece of evidence that supports my claim is in paragraph 3 it says, "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. "" That piece of evidence shows that Venus has a lot of chemicals in their air pollution and that's why barely any people go visit the planet. Next, another piece of evidence that supports my claim is in paragraph 3 it says, "" On the planet's surface, temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. "" That piece of evidence shows that Venus is a very hot planet since it close to the sun too, that means of one day you would go to Venus you would have to drink a lot of water to stay hydrated. Lastly, a piece of evidence that supports my claim in paragraph 3 it says, "" Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments liking erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. "" That piece of evidence shows that Venus can have any type of weather every sinlge day that is different acorrding to the temperature.

In conclusion, that's why I think the author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The conditions in Venus are too extreme for humans to handle. People that would go to Venus probably would only last maybe a day. The next day they would want to go back to Earth and never come back to Venus again. ",3
29fa6eb,"Not driving cars sounds like a crazy idea; How will soccer moms get their kids to soccer practice; How will commuting executives get to their offices? Although driving a car is an easier way of getting around, the amount of pollution a car throws out into the atmosphere just isn't worth it. When people stop driving cars, they start to drastically reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that's being sent out through a car's tailpipes, reduces traffic congestion, and is satisfying a lot of people world wide.

Europe alone is responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, following the United States' 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, in some car-intensive areas. Paris, the capital of France that champions the use of diesel fuels typically has more smog than other European capitals, having 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. Although the bans on cars may receive complaints for delivery companies, there are exceptions such as; Plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more people.

As a result of Paris's partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city, almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and some even had their cars impounded. This partial ban led 60% decrease in traffic congestion. In Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians hiked,biked,skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of the capital city devoid of traffic jams. Rush-hour restrictions in Bogota have also dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have sprung up.

The reactions towards the idea of limiting car usage has been taken with great satisfaction and support. In the city of Bogota,Colombia, a city of 7 million people, millions of colombians participated in a car-free day by either skating,biking, or even hiking to work. Althought it rained, Mayor Antanas Mockus of Bogota explains, ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"". Mayor Antanas's quote just shows what people are willing to do, rather than taking the easier, and lazier way of simply taking their cars to work; In a sense, it shows dedication to the event. Even a high-society man like Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business man from Bogota describes this event as a, ""Good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". This idea; the idea of limiting the usage of cars can be excersized by any class of society, be it poor, middle class, upper class, even rich, can participate, anyone can participate.

In the end, the advantages of limiting car usage includes, reducing the amount of greenhouse gases, reducing traffic congestion, and satisfaction.                                    ",3

we would have saw it with the sattlites. So please belive me when i say that this rock was not created by alines at all! okay so i heard someone thought there was alines on mars. now im going to be honest from what weve seen there is no such thing yes there may be life on mars but small life. Nothing big enough to build something like this.

The only life on mars may be bacteria Now please whoever is saying there are alines please stop. That will be all today proving another myth There is no such thing as aliens on mars. in the article it says that they were made by shadows bealive me when i say its true. If there was such thangs as aliens dont you think we would have found them by now? like honestly we have been looking for them fo years. and nothing trust me there is no alien life on mars. the face in the photo is even blury and doesnt look right this is becasue of sand and dust all over this. it causes an allusion to make u think that there is a face but in reality its not! the photo in 1976 people say its Not just a coquencedence there is a human face on mars. Picture this looking up in the clouds and seeing an animal its just clouds grouped together to make that image. Aleins didnt make that it happened naturally just like on mars.

now that i have explained that there is no life on maars people will now know the truth. And hopefully i dont have to hear about this again because all people are worried about is are there aliens if there were aliens i think we would have known by now.

bf348d8,"On May 24, 2001, Mars was the topic of conversation with those at NASA and other space stations who were included on the Viking 1 and Viking 2 space mission. On that day, the Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars. On the other hand, its sister ship, Viking 2, spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. According to Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, the face on Mars resembles Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. But one argument leaves many citizens guessing: Is the face on Mars a true natural landform?

Most at the NASA space station argue that the face is in fact a true natural landform. The face would be considered a natural landform because there isn't actual proof that aliens had created the landform. This statement meaning that there isn't, for example, video footage proof of the landform being created by aliens, which could have been something that could prove that the face is either natural or unnatural. Another reason why this face could be a natural landform is that no one has actually lived on Mars, so no one could stand up and say whether or not it's natural. For the face to be natural, Mars itself would've had to go through natural causes such as erosion or a quake for the face to be created.

On the other hand, it's easy to see why people would think that the face was created by aliens. In the history of the world, many peculiar events have happened where nobody knew how they happened. For example, all over the Earth, there have been cases of weird patterns appearing in corn fields and mazes. People would say that the patterns were created by aliens, so many just say that weird occurences are due to weird, foreign beings: Aliens. Furthermore, another reason why people would think that the face was created by aliens that ties into the other side of the argument is that since no human being has lived on Mars, there is no factual evidence that states that the face was created by natural causes or by aliens; but since aliens live on Mars and other planets in space, people are forced to make the conclusion that aliens made them.

In conclusion, some people don't even have an opinion and they just believe the scientific evidence over the belief that aliens had created them. People might believe this evidence because some people, in fact, don't even believe in aliens at all. But the face could very well be a natural landform due to natural causes such as erosion of the planet or quakes in Mars that formed the face. Or if there are aliens on Mars, the face-according to some people- could've also been created by aliens that lived on Mars. But according to the scientists and chiefs at NASA, the Mars Exploration Program, and other space stations involved in the Viking 1 and Viking 2 space mission, the face on Mars was only created by natural occurrences and they try to get people to believe it by plastering it all over Hollywood movies, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines.

e1d687a,"Scientists have studied and implored the idea of understanding the solar system, specifically the Milky Way.

In investigating the solar system, Venus shows promises of exploration.

Though Venus itself is denser and hotter than Earth, both planets are one in the same.

The author of the passage utilizes this in explaining as to why investing into the research of this particular planet in the Milky Way is worth it.

The author does this by comparing Venus to Earth within Venus's geometric structures as well as its weather patterns.

Venus can be said to be Earth's twin.

Known as the second planet from the sun, Venus was once like how our planet is today based on scientists' knowledge.

According to the passage the planet,""...(W)as probably covered largely with oceans..."".

Earth contains 70% of water and has life on it and with this quote describing that Venus had water at one point in time, it too might have supported life forms which is what the author is attempting to explain in his writings.

Like Earth, Venus obtains the same landformations.

Another detail provided from the article states,""...surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" indicating not only that this planet once held water but, also sustains land structures identicle to Earth's.

In the final section of paragraph 3 it enscribes,""...(G)eology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerfull earthquakes, and...lighting strikes..."".

Along with the planets identicle features to Earth's, It also features weather patterns and conditions that are compatible too.

Combining all of this information, Venus can be idealized as Earth.

The author gets to the point by comparing the various landforms, weather, and natural disasters of the two space rocks.

Researching Venus could not only mean furthering the understanding of this particular planet but, also Earth too.

Lastly, continuing the study on Venus is so vital that by doing so, man could possibly land another planet. ",3
268f950,"Many people use cars to get around every day.  It's become a common form of transportation and a way of life.  But with this, there are also negative effects of having the widespread use of cars.  It pollutes the earth with substances like smog and uses up more resources from the earth that it needs to, taking from the resources later generations may need.  There are several benefits to reducing the use of cars, such as a cleaner and less polluted earth, and we as people will start to become smarter about our resources.

There are several countries where smog is a serious issue, making it warmer than it should be and dimming the area. not only this, it destroys the Earth's atmosphere.  There are cities where they hold days where nothing but public transportation is allowed, and people who violate will be fined.  Days like these decrease pollution and create a better environment for ours and other generations to come.  If cities all around the world took stands such as this and began to have multiple days of no cars or even ban them, the world may become a cleaner and less polluted place, and the atmosphere may not be destoyed as easily.  What it seems, is that all it really takes is just some effort from us to make the world a better place.

With the banning of car use comes the knowledge of how much of our resources we have wasted on them.  We may start to realize what we have done to the earth, and in turn, ourselves.  It is an extreme pollution to the earth, destroying the atmosphere and depleting the metals and materials used to make and drive these cars.  With the reduction of the use of cars comes the fact that we will no longer destroy the earth with gasoline and diesel fuel, but instead try to keeo if clean and preserve what we still have left.

So, if we try to reduce the usage of cars worldwide, we will stop the massive polution we have created and will gain the knowledge of what we have done, instead of living in blissful ignorance.  There is something we can learn with this. Without cars, smog would almost not be caused by us, and we as a race will no longer destroy our home.    ",3
a0da0ef,"From the very start the author explains the pure beuty of venus, it's nicknamed the ""evening star"" because its one of the brightest points of light in the sky. Another name for this planet would be Earths ""twin"" giving the planet a more welcoming and safer tone. The planet is nearly identical in density and size and in distance, Because of its close range you would think studying such a planet would be easy. the only problem is that earth, venus, and mars orbit the sun at difrent speeds making venus sometimes farther from the earth than mars. Venus is, in space terms, ""right around the corner"" so humans have sent numerous spacecraft, all unmanned, to go and inspect the planet to see if it's safe for human contact. The only problem has been that all the spacecrafts sent have only lasted a couple of hours so to our knowledge it is un-inhabitable. This could explain why we havent had a single spacecraft explore the area in over three decades.

The info we have gathered also contributes to the dangerous nature of venus's reputation as a planet, the atmosphere is described as thick with a blanket of 97% carbon dioxide. A even more challenging factor is the fact that the clouds of venus are highly carosive. Temperatures are over 800 degrees farenheit, the surface temperature of venus is the hottest out of all the plaenets in our solar system.

There's other factor that make venus sound nearly inhospitable but if thats the case why do we still strive to learn more about this vishious planet? Well its because this planet was most likely one of the closest planets related to earth, and still is, it says ""long ago, Venus was probobly covered largely with oceans and could have suported various forms of life, just like earth."" It is our sister planet and theres many fweatures of the planet that are undisputably analougous to those on earth. SInce the planet is so close it is a crucial factor in play giving how long it takes for spacecraft to reach its destination, saving us time and more reaserch.

Now the only question is making reserch safe and scientifically productive, which National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has already been discusing and they have a compeling idea. What theyre discusing is a spacecraft that can hover over the planets fray ,30 miles or so, out of harms way, safe for scientists to examine from afar and quicker to send spacecrafts to the surface. Solar power would run the spacecraft and radiation from that distance would not exceed that of earths. Conditions wont be easy but they would be managable enough for humans to survive. Here on earth even theyres plenty of studies in the works on seing what technology would work best for surviving on venus. This includes a simple electronic made of silicone tested in a chamber simulating that of venus's harsh surface condition, this simple electronic has lasted three weks under these harsh conditions. With thechnology advancing and humans more and more eager to discover our sister planet, if we keep at it we should one day be able to survive on earths twin. ",3
bcb885a,"Being a part of the Seagoing Cowboys was a great experience. I had no idea that it would be as much fun as it turned out to be. For me, this opportuninty meant being able to witness extraordinary places, while being able to help others. For others and yourself it could mean just the same.

I had a great deal of fun on my trip. It gave me an opportunity to see many countries that I may not have seen on any other basis, such as Venice, Italy as well as parts of China, Europe, and Greece. I also chose to spend my off time playing sports and games whenever the chance came along. Your down time; however, would be entirely up to you though, but these are some unique places and things to consider exploring.

My down time was not the most important part of the trip though. It also gave me an opportuntiy to aid others as well as animals, who's homes where left in ruins. After getting this chance to so something more in my life, I knew that this was a great thing that I had invested my time into.

Extensively, I would recomend this as a career path to any who are interested. The years that I was a Seagoing Cowboy, were a great few years in my life.

296e7b0,"A life filled to the brim of better days is what we all want, and limiting car usage has some of these advantages. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter. The sound of children outside of the pollution free community is much more satisfying then getting somewhere with dangers involved. A life without cars is less stressful and more free to explore in safety. Driving tends to make drivers uneasy for fear or crash or being late to work from traffic.

""Mr. Sivak's son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving."" Clearly being late to work and stressed is not something people favor espically when getting to work for free is possible. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC."" Instead of spending thousands of dollars expecting an easier lifestyle your neck rests on the chopping block with the blade ever silently above until it completes is mission. Having this ability feels like freedom but it's actually just a fear inducing, death causing machine. A simple healthier life on a bike seems more enjoyable, and even more so when it promotes good health and your life.

""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Not one person can really enjoy a twenty or fourty minute drive to a mall or anywhere for that matter. It's a waste of time, money, and life. Taking a 5 minute walk to a mall is much more beneficial to your body and health than adding gas to your lungs, and it's quicker too. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Children playing outside instead of inside on their new tablet could be our future again. Parents don't have enough time to spend thirty minutes driving to a park when their child seems content on their fancy iPhone 6. Shopping is also a favorite anywhere, but it seems to be drifting online. Taking five minutes to walk to the mall and save money on not buying a car or spending money on shipping will give more money to buy stuff! A bonus is no more wrong clothing sizes or ordering a lotion that smells like toliet water. Ease of lifestyle is a desire that can be fulfilled when waving goodbye to miles of road and hello to a new jeans that fit for once.

Pollution is a horrible topic that everyone wants to stop, however everyone is ignoring one of its sources. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" It sounds like Earth is becoming like the movie Wall-E, and next stop is a ship in space leaving this trashed planet behind. Paris is setting a great example at trying to remove pollution for healthier living and a better environment. The United States has clearly been challanged and in its effort to be the best it followed suit, ""...It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the evironment."" It is hard to imagine a healthy ecosystem with flourishing plant and animal life in our current situation. With Paris and the United States assisting in the idea of other transpot methods not only will animals have a better chance at not becoming extinct but so will the human race. Dying of pollution will no longer be a concern and money spent on poison can go to lifes other pleasures.

Happiness, fast travel, no pollution, and more new stuff sounds like owning a car right? Carlos Arturo has a taste of the sweet life, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Sadly this is not what a car provides because in fact it only reverses these good things. Despair sets in with fourty minutes waiting in traffic while clouds of gray swirl into the sky returning a shirt that didn't fit. Reconsidering the advantages of having a car and considering the advantages of limiting car usage is the right way to live a perfect life.    ",5
6b6da28,"I think that driveless cars should not be allowed in the U.S becuse, they can be a danger to the citicens, or people on this planet or they might start messing up and might cost a lot of money to repair.

First I think that driveless cars should not be allowed because they can be a danger to the people of america, they can develop a mind of their own or they ,ight cost too much money to fix or mechanics may not be able to fix them, they weren't trained to do those type of cars.

Another reason, is that companies might stp making that much gas because we would have robotic cars and they might not run on gas so companies might not make that much money so they might slow down on producing gas and it would just cause a lot of problems.

Also, why driveless cars should not be allowed is because what if thr robotic driver and a human get into a car accident the judge or whoever is handlling the case wouldnt know who to believe so probably the human would be at fault most likely.",2
60deae4,"Dear Senator:

Our country, the United States of America, needs and deserves a grand president who will work hard and inspire the citizens of this counttry to perservere like our fore-fathers have; and this president needs to be voted by popular vote by his/her citezens in the United States. The presidential elections need to be of popular vote and to be voted by the citizens of America, not by some electoral college. The reason for this is that for one: the candidates ignore the smaller states, two: electors who are chosen can, and possibly will, go against the will of the people; the Electoral College shows signs of inequality amongst the states, unpatrioticism, and unfairness.

If we continue to go by the electoral college, the smaller states who hold inadequite populations will continue to be ignored by the candidates running for presidency. In source 1 paragraph No. 3, it states:""Your states allotment of the electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives and 2 for your Senators."" Also, in paragraph 13 of Source No.2, it states,"" Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning."" So, the candidates ignore the smaller states because of their smaller population and this is a sign of unfairness and inequality amongst the people of America. The future president should address and obtain votes that are from all 50 states of the United States. That is how we treat and show that every person and every state are equal to one another, and that the candidates get an honest and fair vote. The way the Electoral College does things during the presidencial election is everything against how our country came to be- through hardwork, a desire and wish to be equal to one another, and to ensure fairness amongst the people; this Electoral College projects an unpatriotic feel and that itself should not be a process that the United States holds.

The Electoral College is unfair in the fact that the electors chosen by our state legislature can, and possibly will go against the will of the people. With the Electoral College those who vote aren't actually voting for the president but for a slate of electors that elect the president. In Source No.2 paragraph 11, it states: ""In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" This is unfair and a disrespect to a persons choice. It is an act that is untrustworthy and it could happen at any time, people might not even know it. That action practically takes away a citizens right of opinion (speech) which is part of the Bill of Rights, the very basis of what we have a right to have. That in itself is un-American and unpatriotic. This system should be overruled and abandoned for it doesn't go with the basis of our country's ways.

However, the Electoral College does have a some-what strict rule that is rarely broken. In Source No.3 paragraph 16, it states:"" But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for that party's nominee (and that trust is rarely broken)..""

The Electoral College does have some points that it is not totally untrustworthy. But, this point can be broken and can be unfair for the people.

Senator, I hope these points have shown that the Electoral College needs to be voted against due to its unfairness, unpatrioticness, and its act of inequality amongst the states. This country needs it's people to vote for it's president, not a slate of electors.                                                                                                                                                                            ",4
eb8206b,"Do you believe in aliens? An abundance of people in America think there are others among us from other planets and galaxies. They believe this for a variety of reasons, such as UFO sightings or because of the so-called ""Face"" in Cydonia on the Red Planet Mars. Throughout the years since 1976 we have worked at NASA to discover the secrets of the face, uncovering that it is indeed just a landform with suspicious shadows. The ""Face"" is just an ordinary landform on Mars with unusual shadowing because of recent pictures taken of the natural landform, scientific evidence, and measurements taken.

To start, NASA has taken recent picture of Cydonia in 2001 that shows it is just a natural landform that has developed on the Red Planet Mars. ""On April 8. 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia--Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degreesto center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel inv the best 1976 Viking photo."" (p. 10). This shows that NASA has gotten a clear photo of the Face with much better photo quality then the first time iit was photographed.

As discussed before, NASA has taken a new and better quality photo of the Face in Cydonia. Using our scientific equiopment at NASA, we have proven just how much better the resolution is on the new phototgraph taken is. """"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size,"" he added. So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the gtround or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"""" (p. 11). This quote from the article shows it has been scientifically proven there is no markings, indentations, or objects around the Face that would make it be a human skull.

Finally, NASA compares the Face landform with similar landforms on Earth in America. The scientist compares the Face with a landform called a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West. ""it reminds me of Middle Buttle in the Snake ZRiver Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" (p. 12). This uses a real-life example and measurements to compare the two landforms. The scientist Garvin poinmts out that both landforms--the Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and the Face on Mars-- are around the height and shape,

On the contrary, some people believe that the face is """"Bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars--evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists"" (p. 5). In defense, NASA has scientifically proven the ""Face"" is just a natural landform created on Mars. ""What the picture really shows is the Martien equivalent of a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" (p.12).

In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.",5
00e047b,"A car is considered by many a nessecity for everyday life; however, limited usage of our cars has many positive advantages. Emissions from cars create greenhouse gasses, which are detrimental to our enviroment, and limiting the use of our cars can greatly cut down these emissions. Also, many people say that using alternant modes of transportation cut down on the stress they expireinced whilst using a car. In fact, many people are no longer conserned with cars, and young people are begining to stop getting liscenses.

The smog, which is caused by car emissions, in Paris, France was so intense that the city had to place a partial ban on drivers. Those with even number plates faced a fine if they drove on Monday; and, on Tuesday those ith odd number plates would face the same fine if they drove. The ban was so successful in cutting down the smog that the ban was lifted in time for those with odd number plates to drive unrestricted on Tuesday.( source 2) Paris isn't the only city to place bans on driving, in Bogota, Columbia one day a year the city celebrates the 'Day Without Cars'. The idea of this day is to help reduce smog and has even caught on in Cali and Valledupar, also in Columbia.( source 3)

Vauban, Germany makes owning a car unappealing to residents by only allowing two places to park and creating a city plan that facilitates alternative modes of transportation. Many of the residents as a result dont own cars and are happier this way! ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way,"" said resident Heidrun Walter. Cities like Vauban are result of a growing trend in Europe called smart planning, which seprates auto use from suburban life.(source 1) People all around the world also feel positive after limited car use. During the Day Without Cars in Columbia Carlos Arturo Plaza states that the day is "" A good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" (source 3)

In 2013 the average miles driven per American was down 9% from the peak of car usage. This may because the Internet allow people to feel connected or possibly because many center cities renewal have made the suburbs less appealing. Whatever the reason, one things for sure, there has been a substancial drop in the amount of 16- to 39-year- olds getting a liscence. (source 4) America isnt the only place to expierence a drop in car usage. Vauban, Germany makes owning a car impractical and 57% of families sold their cars to live there, while 70% dont own cars. (source 1)

Limiting car usage has positive effects on the enviroment and has shown effective at lowering stress in people. Globally many are already starting to realize adavantages of cutting back on car usage. So while a car may seem like a nessecity, keep the advantages in mind.            ",4

5657bd7,"Cars are not the most important thing in our lives. Although cars are helpful, not having one can help you a lot in the long run. Having a car causes so much stress worrying about the traffic if you're going to be late for work or school, gas prices are not as low as people would like. If you had to walk everywhere or ride your bike, you could be getting a lot of exercise from it. People think having a car is so important but they dont see the positive side to it.

Many people stress out if they are not going to make it to work on time because of traffic, I know that I dont make it to school on time because of all the traffic trying to get into my school is horrible. Instead of stressing out, you can just go on a calm walk or bike ride to your destination. In the article written by, Elisabeth Rosenthal, there is a quote from Heidrun Walter saying, ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" because they had banned cars in his city. You can always find an alternative way of getting to where you need to go. If someone has a meeting to go to, they can always use the alternative of the Internet if they cant get their in time or the weather is not the best. Instead of stressing out about driving, you can walk to your destination and save money from not paying for gas.

We all know that gas prices are high and out of our budget. They've reached four dollars, that's insane! Why would anyone want to spend that money if they don't have to. There is a simple solution on saving your money that you waste on gas, and that is walking or riding your bike. Some people can afford the prices of gas but others are struggling in the economy but are to lazy to walk, nobody wants to get exercise so they drive everywhere.

Banning cars on the street is a good way to help people get exercise. If they know they can't drive, they would obviously walk or take a bike because they have places to be. It would be an effective way to get people to stop being lazy and helping their health. Some people would probably get frustrated because they have to walk everywhere but it's only helping them.

Walking or riding a bike is a good opportunity to realize the beauty of life without stressing out over bad drivers or traffic, saving money, and getting exercise. Most people would think banning cars on the street is a good idea for those few reasons. I know that it is super effective although some people may not see it until it actually changes.    ",4
bfbf91c,"Emotions are the most hardest things to understand from yourself or from others, usually people can identify them if they now the situation that has, had or is about to happen. But there are some emotions or facial expressions that people just don`t know or understand what it`s supose to be or mean. This can be said for any thing. This can be said for about anything, but what would happen if someone had a machine that can tell you, mathematically and calculate what emotions you are felling or have felt if it is a photo.

To explain the machine , it is a computer the constructs a 3-D computer model of a face. It reconizes all 44 major muscles in a face of a model and must move like human muscles. It roconizes the action unit of a more muscles in a face. the machine was created by DR. Paul who created the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) and Dr. Huang. It basically tracks and understands differnt empotions by tracking and understanding facial expressions, since people le understand how a person feels based on physical expressions of the face. The computer is then able to under stand a persons emotion.

This level of technology is advense, but what would happen if this kind of computer was mobile and was used in a school, by teachers to know what emotions a student was feeling, to and they used as if it were a lie detector. Well there are pros for the teachers, like if a student was lieing to them about an assignment or a use it to understand what happened in their class by simply scanning the students and use the information they have to esstimate an answer. It would be convenient for the teacher or even a priciple to figure out what the student is feeling. Usually a teacher would ask the student about what happened to the student. They would use the computer if they don`t care and only want the truth from the student as a positive answer they would understand. They computer would most likely idintify someone who is lying and get punishment. It could also help a teacher understand if the student is under stress and would be able to do something before the student does something that would their greatest mistake they could end up taking. Other reasons is being able to find out why a student is queit and not talking to everyone that are his or her friends. They would even be able to find out secrets that a student is keeping from them, if it`s good or bad the teacher would simply be able to figure out what it is.

With every pro there is a con that exist, for one how would the computer be able to be mobile, the computer that can calulate emotions would be huge and bulky to carry aroung. Plus there arew few apps that can tell emotions ,even if they have a few mistakes. Besides that it would be consider an invasion of privacy, since most people would want to keep something a secret, like love. It would even something that students would try to get away from it either try to keep it a truth and really saying that you did an assignment or risk it all and get caught.

From all this information having aving a computer that teel emotions would have it`s ups and down,some being able to find some who has lied and catch them and even helping someone who have problems with themselves or at home. The con is that people would try to avoid it, or if they had to understand something they could just ask the student and have a conversation with them about whats wrong ang why. Having an emotion computer have some percs, but would be use on rare occasions. ",3
5caf763,"We should continue the development for these self driving cars. They could prove safer than regular human driven cars and could reudce the cost of fuel.

These self driven cars are equiped with scanners that have become advanced enough to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids and rollovers. The scanners can use the information to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine. Thus allowing for a far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

Not only can self driving help prevents accidents caused by human error it can also help with another serious problem. While these cars will most likely still run on the same fuel supply as regular cars. If development continues these cars may be able to run on half the fuel of a regular car which in turn could lower gas immesions into the air. Not only will the self driving car be more energy suffient it will also be a more partical means of transportation if development is to cotinue.

""The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day."" Its only a matter of time until the self driving car reaches it's full potential. As long as development continues and laws are passed allowing the use of these cars. We should be seeing a big change in how we drive our cars in the next couple of years..              ",3
3dea620,"My position on the driverless cars is that they would be good to have. A big reason for this is because if they had driverless cars recks would decrease and people wouldnt get hit crossing the road.the reason I think this is because the cars would have computers that would be smarter and more observent about there surroundings. They would be able to respond to situations better than what humans can. This would also make distracted driving a thing of the past because humans would not be controling the caar but instead it would be a computer with sensorse.

A big problem we have now is destracted driving. It causes alot of accedents and caused deaths. a good way to have no distracted driving would be to have diverless cars. Not only would it stop accednts from acurring but also would minumize the deaths due to car crashes. The car would have a laser beam that forms a 3-D model of the cars surroundings.

Having a car that drives it self would also make parents less afraid of there kids being behind the wheel. If thes cars can drive themself then ther will be no reason parents should be afraid of there teen getting hurt. most car crashs are caused by teen drivers. if cars drive them selfs then teens wont get into car crashs and maybe saving there lives.

The only big problem of having driverless cars would be the price. if not every one can afford a driverless car it wont make crashs go aaway. yes it will make then less likly to happen but if not everyone can afford there will still be crashs. there will still be people driving and not just driverless cars. if they make driverless cars they should make it to where every one can afford them.

In conclusion i think that they should have driverless cars.It would help in many ways and make travleing safer for everyone.it would also reduce the number of car crashs. Also it could save lives of people. thats why i think we should have driverless cars.",4

How they way you live and do certain things in a regular basis would dramatically change. Scientists are now studying the planet Venus and they want to conduct experiments on how to ge there and what it would be to be there for days.

Venus is the second planet which makes it challenging for scientist to study because in the recents years they have sent spacecrafts to venus but none have had any luck. They usually will only last a few hours before it stops working and none of them has landed in Venus. It has been stated that Venus has very high temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we normally experience here on our own planet.

Studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that come along with it. Scientist could be studying Venus for years and years and their caculation could still not be right even if they are certain it is. They have been wanting to send humans to Venus and see how it is but they aren't sure yet. They could have proven that if a human steps on Venus nothing bad will happen but they could be completely wrong and not know that. Another good reason on why they continue to study is because Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Eath-like planet from our solar system.

In conclusion, I believe they should continue studying such an amazing planet but I don't think it will be worth it to send an actual human being not knowing the concequences of what will happen. I would prefer them send someone who already how studied everything about Venus and send the exact person and hopefully be able to come back with more gathered information and help scientist know more about Venus.

5e20c0f,"If you were a teacher trying to teach a class with over 20 people with different emotions, how efficent would it be to know how all of them feeling? You can do that with FACS (Facial Action Coding System), created by Dr. Pail Eckman. This system classifys 6 basic emotions. It can sense happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This is good for teacher who dont understand how their student are feeling about the assignment they assigned.

Dr. Huang, says in paragraph four, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" He says, "" even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" Using video imagery, the emotion-recongnition software tracks these facial movements on a real face or even a picture. The author uses an example of the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci. They used the emotion-recongnition on the painting and it showed how Mona Lisa was feeling. It not only looks at how your smiling or how your eye are placed, it also looks at the structure of ur face and how your muscles move.

This creation can help lots of teacher all around the world understand and help students learn more efficently. Every single student learns differently and using this system will help teacher use their teaching time wisely. When student dont understand somthing this system can scan your face and tell the teacher what needs to be fixed to help the student understand and enjoy what they are learning.

Instead of teachers trying to help one student at a time they can help multiple students at once.

You can also use FACS not only in school but other places too. You can use it in work and also in everyday life if you wanted too. In paragrah nine the author talks about a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky. He had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Just making different faces can revel a lot about the science of emotion.

FACS is the next big thing. Science has gone to a whole new level in helping our society. Using this system can help all kinds of people in different ways. I think this can help our world grow and learn new things. ",4
455511f,"A Car Free Future?

Is the car necessary in the 21st Century? Many city planners and government officals around the globe dont think so. Car free days are becoming common place in Europe and South America, and in the German town of Freiburg, an upscale neighborhood where cars are banned, has been a kind of experiment for larger towns and cities without cars. In Paris smog levels have gotten so high, that people have been asked not to drive their cars, in order to reduce pollution levels.

In the United States, the number of miles driven peaked in 2005, but has dropped nine percent since then. This is largely due to the 2008 recession, but also due to more people becoming educated about the effects that cars have on the environment. More people are choosing to take public transport, or carpool, because mainly it's cheap, and it's good for the environment.

Many key sociologists believe that this trend will continue. One of those sociologists is Professor Mimi Sheller, Diector of the Mobilities Research and Policy center at Drexel University. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift"" there are many factors that point to the ""major cultural shift"" that Proffesor Shelley referred to. For example,the renewal of city centers has made the suburbs seem less appealing, and has drawn many people into the cities. Many carpooling apps have appeared in the last 2 years.

Better cities, more public transport, and an increase in telecommunications is the start of a global movement to reduce pollution and increase efficiency. the age of the car is coming to an end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ",3

It's kind of cool but eveybody is'nt the same this might affend people because your going into someones personal life now. It states that ""Hold on! Can we actually ""calculate"" emotions like math homework? And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"" That was a great statement because, i could smile in a picture but actually be hurting inside how can a computer tell that?

I don't think that this will help in schools, or the future. Why would we need FACS when you have your own mindset that can tell you how your feeling? Also friends can tell when one is up or down there are many ways to know the humans emotions without using a computer. I think it's just going into someones personal life without asking and thats never ok. There are many things that we need on Earth but, the creating of FACS is not one.

61749b6,"Technology that can read your emotional expressions is very valuable to students in a classroom, because it can provide information on how you are feeling. It provides emotions that a humans eye cannot detect. A lot of people dont realize how others are feeling because they hide their emotions. Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) created a facial system to detect the emotions of a person's face. This system is very valuable because it gives better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

This software constructs a 3-D computer model of the face with all 44 major muscles in the model. Eckman classified six basic emotions-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness and he asscociated each with characteristic movements of facial muscles. A big amount of students dont focus because of the distraction around them. A teachers job is to keep them focused at all times, but sometimes it is hard for an individual person to keep track of so many students. This techonolgy can help students in many different ways. By weighting the different units, the software can identify mixed emotions, which can help the student by making the work they are doing simple or more difficult. For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. It modifies the lesson, like an effective human instructor.

The FACS is a very valuable techonolgy for students because it helps to guide them through a problem they might be facing. It can help a classroom full of students that are confused on a lesson. The software can detect their emotional expressions and switch up the lesson to make it more understandable. For example if a student does not undertsand the problem, the computer can detect his or her confusion, and it will modify to fit his or her understanding. The software is very valuable for the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.          ",3

a0ca798,"Dear state senator,

Im in favor of keeping the electoral college. This process might take a while but not as much as election by popular votes for the president of the united states.

The election by popular vote is saying that the electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. Well I think its not, it's widely regarded as a thing that seems to belong to the past but also not to fit in the president. The electors are the ones who elect for the president not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate we're basically voting for a slate of electors. The residents of the other regions are most likely feel that their votes don't count and that the new president will have no intersts, also that he really isn't  their president.

Keeping the electoral college is the best idea. Some people might not like it but some would. Others might not like the idea of voting by popular votes for who can be president. Also under the amendment of the constituation, the district of Columbia is allocated three elctors and treated like a state of purposes of the electral college. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Unlike the others. They just vote by how big the state is and by how many repesenitives there are.

The electors are picked by depending on the states which makes it fair enough. Back then the louisiana legislature barley succeeded in getting rid of and getting new democratic electors. If the election was a tie it would be handed over to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president beacuse each state casts olny one vote.

The winner of the take all method of awarding electral votes as a couples years ago. Election focuses their campagin efforts on toss up states. the voters in the toss up states are more likey to pay attention to the campaign, knowing their going to decide the elections. but the most thoughtful voters should be the ones the decides the elections not the electors.

8a45d93,"Hi, I'm Kelvin and I go against this technology to read students emotional expressions. This is totaly BS, Dr. Huang and Pro. Nicu made this really cool software called the Facial Action Coding System. Calculating emotions is diferent from coding your face with a 3-D mode of your face that could barely even look like you. Plus there are more than the basic six emotion everbody has. It is still a very cool idea but not for us students.

Dr. Huang said that every facial emotion is universaly the same in paragraph 4, but some people can feel emotions without making that facial emotion on thier face. This software can be an evasion of privacy for students who would not like to be disterb by this software showing it to your teacher and then the teacher would call or give you a private lesson in school. Mixed emotions are even more complecated for the software to know. There are 44 major muscles in our faces are realy cool but, technology is not yet advanced for this to be true. And the Mona Lisa could just be happy.

How can this ""Facial Action Coding System"" even tell the Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy. The technology is not advance enough to say what emotions we have. How can this software even know the emotions we have on a picture. The Mona Lisa is a painting not a picture, so that cannot be corect. Da Vinci Code is something different from Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms. Communication doesn't have to do anything with the software, but maybe us the students.

And finaly this stuff can't be used in public, who is going to use this sofware than the school. Video games are mostly the freedom of choice for most people . And emotional communication will still need to wait for technology to advance. Who is even gona use this. People do not caare what think about us the students. Making privat lessons based on our faces isn't a good idea. Many bad culd use this software to invade privacy from others.

And this is my reasons why I think this software sucks and should never be used.",3

He took a picture using the camera's maximum resolution. The photo showed that the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which are landforms common around the America West.

c62e70c,"In the article ""The Challenge Of Exploring Venus"" the author

has explained and backed up his idea of studying Venus excellently. The author used clear facts of the harms and conditions that Venus has and why we can't just enter without protection. While the author was stating these facts he also was coming up with ideas of what NASA and other scientist are doing to better the chances of human beings going there and studying the Earth-like planet. The author continuously kept stating ideas of what human being could do to study Venus and not once said that we couldnt. The author was also very confident about his idea everytime he tought of one idea another one was on deck, just in-case one plan didnt seem so possible to humans.

In Paragraphs 1-5 the author is constantly stating facts of what Venus

is now and the harms and conditions that it has. Paragraph 3 it stated mostly why humans can't be there to live or just to study. Paragraph 3 stated for example,''on the planets surface, temperature average pver 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our planet.'' It also stated, that ''these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.'' He/She is baisically stating that the atmoshere and surface temp. is far more for a human to be there studying or living without ssome use of technology.

As the author states harms and conditions he/she also starts to

think of some ways us humans can build some technology of some sort to get us the information we need from the studyings of this planet. He/She started explaining an idea that NASA has compelled to try to get us over to the planet without being harmed. Paragraph 5 it stated,'' Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles abover the roiling venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.'' In that statement he/she explained that it would risky but survivable for humans.

As i stated in the first paragraph above the author started

using conclusions of how we were going to use the technology and what other idea NASA may come up with incase one plan went left. In paragraph 6 it stated, ''we only have a limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomsphere.'' this is where the author starts using methods of how the mission will be preformed because of some road blocks we'll run into. Paragraph 7 it stated, ''NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in chamber simulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions.''

The author has done a fantastic job wit backing up his idea with

details, facts, road blocks and the way the missons should go. He/She did an amazingly, confident article of how us humans could study venus, if one plan went left he/she stated other plans NASA and other scientis are coming up with in the studying of Venus. The details in this article would surely help scientist out with procedure of studying Venus. I think the author did a fantastic job with supporting his idea of studying Venus. ",4
99f5857,"First, Face is just a natural landform because even if it was created by alians there should be some type of building or something some where a round the Face like a building. Think about it. Do you really think that some alian is going to build something like that and leave it there? There is so much things we don't know about Mars, but aliens are not real. According to the text,""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

Second, when we took a picture of the Face in 1976. It was because of the weather that it looked like a face. Another reason is because of the angle that we took a picture in. It might also have been the camera. Because of the angle that in took the picture in, the shadow of the mountains made it look like a face. According to the text,""The caotion noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth.""

Next, in 1998, we decided to take another picture of the Face. The tecnology became better and so we got a better view of the Face. It does't look as much like the face we took a picture of in 1976. This time it looked more like a crater. It wasn't a face after all.

Then, in 2001, we took another picture because it was so popular. According to the author,""It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" You might think that aliens are real. According to the text,""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" We have been searching Mars for a while now and if there was any life form on Mars we would have found it already.

Finally, Face is just another natural land form. According to the author,""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" So it wasn't created by any living thing. It was created by nature. Face is just another natural landform on Mars.",4
4666036,"In this essay, I will be showing how the face on Mars is just a plain everyday landform.

In 1976, a picture was taken by the satellite Viking 1. The picture on Mars was found to be what looked like the face of an Egyptian god. The pictures taken were blurry but showed to actually be a face indicating there was life on Mars sometime in the past or even here in the present. NASA kept studying this mask for years to come. A few years later, another satellite took pictures about 10 times sharper and clearer. But in this picture, the so called mask just looked like a normal everyday landform. The media was not happy with this picture. But this picture did show proof that there was just a landform just like on Earth, that was nothing special. Even one of NASA's global surveyor said that there are landforms on Mars just like on Earth.

In conclusion, the landform on Mars was just a simple regular crater that looked like a face in a poor quality, blurry picture.                 ",2

Though car ownership is still legal, places to park are very limited. Only 70% of Vauban's families don't own cars. 57% sold a car to move there. ""When I had a car  I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. (3) Vauban, home to 5,500 residents withtin a rectangular square milem may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life.

Paris has also done something similar to better the lives of their citizens. Paris, France's capital city has banned driving due to smog. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air. Paris has a strict schedule on when you can drive if you really have to. On Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-Euro. 22 Euros is equivilant to $31 in U.S currency. This ban has led to almost 4,000 drivers being fined. (12) And 27 people had their cars impounded due to their reaction to the fine. The amount of smog before this ban was applied was 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter. This is a significantly high difference in the amount of smog compared to Brussels with 114 micrograms and only 79.7 in London. Although, the ban has helped clear this smog, enough on Mondays to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

Vauban and Paris both have very excellent results in their experiments due to the changes in their environment with cars. Maybe more cities in the near future will join in on this ban against cars. Instead of driving your car to the nearest pharmacy to pick up some things, take a walk to save gas and to get some fresh air. Maybe this ban isn't for everyone, but even trying to limit car usage to minimal can help the environment. Instead of driving your car to the nearest pharmacy to pick up a few things, try walking there. You'll get some well needed excercise and fresh air.                                                     ",3
96b1038,"Transportation by a vehicle like a car is very common these days.  It's an efficient way to travel for the most part, and has been used as an option for traveling since the early 1900s.  Although cars have many upsides, they also have downsides too.  By limiting car usage in more places, there could be many advantages.  First, it could improve safety.  Also, it will conserve resources.  And lastly, limiting car usage will allow a tremendous decrease in pollution.

Limiting car usage will improve safety in a number of ways.  By limiting car usage, there will most likely be a decrease in deaths since many car accidents result in fatality.  It is not only cars colliding with other cars that is the issue; it is cars having the power to destroy most things it comes in contact with. Cars are not toys but rather death machines.  They have the ability to cause major damage which is why if limited usage is enforced, there will most likely be less accidents resulting in major/minor injuries or even death.  There are many options for getting around besides using a car.  For example, there are electric scooters, mopeds, skateboards, rollerskates, bicycles, and even good old-fashioned walking.  While some of these could potentially be dangerous, they are probably not as dangerous as driving a car.

Another reason limiting car usage could be beneficial is the conservation of resources.  Cars are heavy machinery and need an abundance of fuel to keep them going for years and years.  What powers most vehicles currently is fossil fuel.  Fossil fuel is not an everlasting resource and will be gone someday.  Now there are some cars that run on electricity, but for the most part, cars around the world run on fossil fuel.  Considering that there are about one to two cars per household nowadays, that would mean both cars are probably getting filled with gas or even being charged with electricity (which could run your electricity bill through the roof).  Since this applies to most people around the world, think of the resources being used daily.  This usage of resources could be lessened by just limiting the usage of cars.

The last benefit of limiting car usage is less air pollution.  Cars run on fossil fuel, as I stated in the previous paragraph.  When a car is being driven, that fuel exits the car in a gas state.  This gas form of fuel is very harmful to the environment.  With so many cars on the road today, the atmosphere is already polluted a great deal.

Usually you will see signs that read ""No Idling"" outside of a store or any public area where cars are allowed which means that when you are parked, and are going to be parked for an extended period of time, you should turn your car off so that it does not let out gas.  In Paris, a partial driving ban was actually enforced so that the amount of smog in the air would decrease.  That is how much the usage of cars can affect an environment.

Overall, setting a limitation on car usage in more places can have benefits.  It could improve safety, conserve resources, and allow for less pollution to the environment.  With these reasons, I don't see many reasons for people to frown upon this idea.    ",4
3040974,"Luke's participation in the Seagoing Cowboys effected his life and how he saw things. He got to see unique things, participate in the recovery of other countries during the war, and it impacted his life forever. Other people who want to help the world should definitely participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The first reason why other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program is because they would get to help recover other countries from the war.

The text states, by the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. On all of those trips, Luke was helping deliver cattle to other countries to recover their food and animal supply. Many countries were in ruins and they needed the help that the Seagoing Cowboys provided.

Next, more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because they would get to see and visit many unique and interesting places around the world. The text states, Luke was able to see the Acropolis in Greece. The text also states, on his many trips, Luke got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Finally, others should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it will change their lives. The text states, after his great adventures as a Seagoing Cowboy, Luke's family was lead to host a number of international students for many years. The text also states, this experience opened up the world to Luke. Luke also got to bond with new people on board the SS Charles W. Wooster. He got to spend lots of time with them including times of playing volleyball, baseball, fencing, and many more activities to help pass time.

This shows why more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. They would get to see unique things, participate in the recovery of other countries during the war, and impact thier lives forever.      ",4
a885751,"The Face is actually a natural landform. It's a huge rock formation which is also common in the American West. It's proven by Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbit Camera because it's ten time sharper than the orginal. All this mostly proves that it's not an alien monument.

When NASA reveal the image for everyone to see, the authors thought it's a good way to engage attention on Mars. According to the text, it stated, "" huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadoes giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This caption have brought attraction on Mars and books, magazines, radio talk shows, and Hollywood film has starred.

Most of the people thought of an alien comparacy but when Malin and his MOC team snapped a better view of it, it proves it wasn't an alien monument. According to the text, it stated, "" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a oicture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

If it's not an alien monument, what is it? Garvin said it was a landform which reminds him of mostly Middle Butte. According to the text it stated,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.""

The picture is a landform after all. Most might be disappointed that it's not an alien monument. It's also been proven by the pictures over the year they had taken of which mostly is not an alien monument. Again, it's a picture of a butte or mesa, which are common around the American West.",3

Not only student but also adulsts might not like it either when they go to work and there boss trys to scan them and see what emotion thier in. I don't think anybody will like that idea of have that kinda technology. I'll say it will not be a good idea because what if the scanner is wrong not saying it is but what about after multiple tests on the scanner and its scans a person and the scanner says thier in that mood and if the person might not be in that moods the machine will probably be giving the wrong information.

I can say that I don't believe that techology can always be right and always be right because theres been problems with other stuff that they have invented like cars,phones,computers,laptops,and droms. Some stuff can maunfunction not everything that has been invented turn out great. That why I said a scanner that can read emotional experssion is kinda of a bad.

I don't think techology is ment for that purpose I don't think will like the idea. People don't want technology reading thier emotions its thier life nobody just can go up to them and start scanning thier face.",2
b3e7677,"Should America really go out without the common everyday use of cars as transportation? Just think; which is more convenient? For some people, walking may do it... but there would be much difficulty without the utilization of cars during this modern era.

In

German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it is claimed that in VAUBAN, Germany, residents have given up their use of cars.

""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have no change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America.

Cars are, without a doubt the fastest means of transportation from street-to-highway; and very convenient in more ways than one. Sure, it may be alright to walk whenever you may feel to, but how will you be able to get to work faster if your job is many miles away? It surely will tire you out by then.

In

Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog, forces have banned cars from common usage and ordered the residents to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine.

""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters.""

This lets me know that many people disagree with the idea of not being able to have their own cars within their reach. In certain weather conditions, such as the cold, harsh winter, just the thought of traveling on a bicycle or walking does not do any good for us! And in the summer when the humidity conditions are so high and hot, we would be too exhausted to move a muscle and refuse to walk any more than what is the seven-eleven down the block from us. In addition, you can carry many personal belongings in the comfort of your car -- which is much simpler than having to stand on your legs or tire them out from excessive bicycle-riding, along with having to deal with five bags of groceries filling your hands. When convenience comes to us, it's a good idea not to reject that opportunity.

In

The End of Car Culture

(also by Elisabeth Rosenthal) it is discussed that President Obama agrees with the abomination of car transportation. The opposing argument may say,

""

Observations show that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...""

But I can certainly disagree and state that not only is transpotation through cars a great way to get around, but it's also entertaining. In the car, you can listen to the radio, whether its news or listening to music on the way back home from work, (which is sometimes stressful.) Atleast you know you'll be sitting in your car comfortably, while listening to music. Also, traffic jams may be problematic; but for some people, the overpopulation of many people being crammed up into your personal space in the outside air may be a real pain. Even excessive crowdedness that occurs on the bus may very well be a daily struggle for people who dislike crowds.

Cars will only continue to grow in a positive way in the future, and I believe that is something our past has brought to us, and only for the good of it. So why not use it? Driving is better than walking/bike riding. We shouldn't be working our way backward, but looking to our future, and that calls for the better and more advanced technology that the people have brought to us, that our nation shall continue only to improve--and cars would be one of them.

d007c8f,"I crossed the Atlantic Ocean over ten times. I crossed the Pacific twice to help people who were struggling from World War II. The article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" writtten by Peggy Reif Miller was not only a story for encouraging people who are down and need to do something, but it also gives the main charcter's point of veiw too. Miller tells us how daring the adventure can be over seas, but what I tell is totally different. When I was over seas I saw many beautiful things. Miller may thought it was scary, but I assure you it is not.

When I was out of high-school I was working two jobs. I worked at a grocery store and at a bank. Then my friend Don Reist gave me a call asking if I wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It was an opportunity of a life time. I said yes. It was 1945 and as you know World War II was going on. In August 1945, I received orders to report to New Orleans. We arrived the 14 of August, the day the Pacific War ended. I turned 18 before arriving in Greece. I could become apart of the army. The board saw I was apart of the cattle-boat trip. So they told me to stay on it. I was fine with it. By the time I discharged in 1947, I made nine trips. The most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Maybe one day you could become the Seagoing Cowboy to make the most trips. Maybe you could become apart of the army. If you become apart of the Seagoing Cowboy you can accomplish many things. I told you it's not scary. Your making exhilerating things happen.

The cattle-boats were an unbelievable opportunity for me. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis was very special though. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. It was extrordinary! I was done with the tours and we were crossing the Atlantic from the easten coast to the United States of America. I was on duty of cleaning stalls and feeding the animals. I was watch man for one night. I was making my report to captain when I slipped on the ladder. I most fell into sea, but I recovered. I had a few cracked ribs, but I was fine. I had time to have fun on board. I played many games with my friends. Some games we played were volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. A Seagoing Cowboy kind of sounds fun now doesn't it. You could have so much fun with your friends and other new people. You can have fun with the animals. The big part of being a Seagoing Cowboys is getting to say this, ""I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" This awareness stayed with me.

So you got the point of veiw from other people like Miller and people who don't like the army, but now you got my point of veiw. People think it's scary or dangerous. Yes, it's dangerous, but fun. Not only do you get to help people, but you get to see amazing veiws and you get to encourage other people to do great things. I've crossed the Atlantic Ocean over ten times, I've crossed the Pacific twice. Can you do the same or something even better?",2
f135718,"In the intense debate concerning the validity of the Electoral College process, it is difficult to choose a position. The Electoral College is a long-standing tradition created by the founding fathers in the early days of the United States. However, the reasons behind the adoption of the Electoral system are not as valid today as they were centuries before. Electoral College was proposed by the founding fathers due to the fact that the average American citizen in the beginning of our nation was a simple farmer, who was not educated enough to make an informed decision in a vote. Nowadays, things are different. General education of the public is very advanced, and there are various easily acessable forms of media from which to learn about the policies and positions of the presidential canidates. After all, the president's job is to care for and protect the people of America, not the politicians. Therefore, shouldn't the people, not the politicians, elect the president?

Even those who support the Electoral College must admit it is a confusing system. When a citizen votes for a presidential canidate, that vote really goes to a slate of electors who were selected by means that vary between states and are pleged to that particular canidate, and those electors then vote for the president. As pointed out in Bradford Plumer's

The Indefensible Electoral College , voters can't control who their electors vote for. Aditionally, ""voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate"" (also Bradford's

The Indefensible Electoral College

). And Bradford makes a good point; in the past, ""'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate"".

There is also the fact that canidates for the presidency often focus on ""swing states"", states whose majority is not decided between political parties and whose votes have a large impact on the election. This is due to the winner-take-all method of the Electoral College. In a state that is mostly Republican, a Democratic presidential canidate may not put much into the local campain, knowing that since most voters are against them they would probably lose the state and gain nothing, because all the electoral votes of a state go to the canidate who won the majority of voters in that state. Thus, presidential campains are focused in the swing states, giving little attention to the others. However, if the presidential election were decided by popular vote, campain efforts would be spread evenly across the United States since every voter everywhere counted in the final election.

The method of electing a president by popular vote is a fair and well-balanced one, giving the minority parties in non-swing states a say in the presidency. Also, it was  discovered that ""according to a Gallup poll in 2000...over 60 pecent of voters would prefer a direct election"" (Bradford Plumer,

The Indefensible Electoral College

). It was even admitted by pro-Electoral College Richard A. Posner in his

Defense of the Electoral College that ""A tie in the national electoral vote is possible"" due to the even number of total votes. Posner also states that ""no voter's vote swings a national election"". However, if everyone believed that, no-one would vote at all. Then there could be no election, Electoral College method or otherwise. Therefore, the individual voter does count, and so do all the minority political parties who's electoral slates do not get to vote for the president due to the Electoral College. Popular vote is the only reasonalble system for electing a president who will do their best for the American people. ""Of the people, for the people"". So let the all the people Vote.    ",5
c5641ea,"The Fatial Acting Coding System would actually make a valuable impact not just for the students sake, but also for the teachers as well. Since the teacher would be able to to view the students expressions the students would be more interested in attending school and would have better knowledge of what they are learning. These days students are bored in schools so I think if the teachers could actually know what the students are thinking they woud be able to make school more interesting for them.

By using the Fatial Acting Coding System it could actually make the students more interested in what the teachers are trying to teach them. I feel like if classrooms actually used this kind of technology it would transform the students to actually want them to come to school and be more intersted in learning. The only way that students tend to learn is threw technology and I believe that if this technology is shown to the students then they would be more interesting in school. There is new technology being released every single day and I think that if the students actually got hands on experience with this technology then they would actualy like to attend school because this new technology is their future. Not only could the system make school more interesting but it can also help the student obtain knowledge the right way instead of the wrong way.

If the teachers actually got to use the FACS I would feel that the teacher could actually substitute their way of teaching for another way that the students would actually obtain the knowledge. Most of the time students have no clue on what the teacher is trying to teach them because they don''t just like teachers talking the whole period and the teachers just don''t get that, but by using the Fatial Coding System the teachers could actually know what they students are feeling and teach a different way. If the teacher teaches a different way than the students will obtain the knowledge a better and possibly faster way than before. For example if the teacher always talked the whole time and the teacher knew the students were not getting any knowledge from that then the teacher could take a different aproach. The author stated that when the classroom could recognize the students emotions

and they got confused or bored then the computer would modify the lesson so the student would better understand the information.

In conclusion I think that by using this type of technology it would enhance the students to obtain knowledge that they may need for the future. Overall I think that this system can make school more interesting as well as that the students will be able to get more inforation than ever before. I was always told that knowledge is key and I believe that his system is the key therfore this system is knowledge.",4
5eb33fc,"My argument about Lukes point of view is that you should always try soething new or something you always wanted to do. In this story Luke is working at a store and his friend invited him to go on a cattle boat to Europe after World War 2. He knew this would be an opportunity of a lifetime. So he went.

You could see how he was feeling just by the way the author put it. He was exicited and he was ready. When Luke found out that he was to take care of horses, young cows, and mules he knew he would be good at it because he worked at his aunts farm. He thought this would be a good time to help out with this disaster. Luke went overseas just to do someting helpful for the problems people had. All the stuff people had were gone because of the World War 2.

He had some rough times on way, like running into storms, big waves and other stuff that happen in the ocean, but hey it was worth it. But some thingss got severe, when he broke his ribs during a storm. He took nine trips on the cattle boat. And this was big for him because he was a small - town boy. He also knew he was helping out thousands of people. Over seas, Luke was very busy with the animals. He had to feed them 2 to 3 times a day. Thats a lot of work for young boy.

Just by reading this article you can tell how much work you will have but your doing it for people who can't do this stuff. So what, it may be hard, it may be boring, but those people need your help. Thats why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Luke was brave enough to do this kind of thing just because of 1 thing, he had faith in him, his best friend, and the people.

e01085e,"About twenty-five years ago, NASA's Viking 1 spotted a shadowy human face on Mars. Upon returning to Earth, scientists concluded that this shadowy face is simply a natural landform on Mars. Although conspiracy theorists and the media tend to warp the truth, it is in fact true that this face is nothing but a landform on Mars. NASA conducted two investigations, and used data they gathered and used dated the gathered prior to the ""Face on Mars"" to reach their conclusion.

The first image of the ""Face on Mars"" was taken in 1976. After receiving this information scientists concluded that this was actually another martian mesa, which is common in Cydonia, the place on Mars the image was taken. The image was released a few days later to the public. There was an uproar of theories and conclusions immediately made by the public and the media. This caused problems for NASA. The theory that NASA is hiding life on Mars from the public was a common theory made by conspiracy theorists. The public disregarded NASA's thorough investigation and proof and believed the theorists, who did not have any proof or support, rather than believing the scientists who had taken time to investigate this image and its origin.

A few scientists began to believe that the Face was actually an alien artifact. NASA then figured that the image of the Face would be important for the public. On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and a camera team took pictures that were ten times clearer than the ones taken in 1976. Upon returnung to Earth scientists revealed yet again that the ""Face on Mars"" was a natural landform. This was no suprise to some people because the scientists had concluded before that the Face was a mere landform and nothing else, even after investigating the image twice.

NASA conducted yet another investigation on April 8, 2001 in order to make sure the Face was not created by aliens. A camera team took more photographs of the Face and made them bigger to get vloser look. Scientists concluded once more that the Face is the equivalent of a butte or a mesa. This is because landforms that are alike to buttes and mesas are common on Mars. The images that were taken also showed no form of alien life or markings near or on the Face. The scientists who believed that this was a simple landform were correct since the begining, unlike the media and theorists who made up their own conclusions to confuse the public.

After a face-like landform was found on

Mars in 1976, many people believed that there was life on Mars that NASA was hiding from the public. This theory is not true. NASA conducted two investigations after discovering the Face: one on April 5, 1998 and one on April 8, 2001. After both investigations scientists concluded that the "" Face on Mars"" was in fact nothing but a natural landform. This conclusion made by NASA is true. It has been stated the these types of landforms that resemble buttes or mesas are common in Cydonia, the place the Face was found. Both times the images were taken a special camra crew took photgraphs for analyzation. On the second investigation the image was made three times bigger. After not finding any evidenve of alien life form or markings near or on the Face, scientists concluded that the ""Face on Mars"" has always been a landform.            ",4
ec6fa71,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a passage about how Venus is the twin of earth. The second planet from the sun but yet the most hottest one of all.The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents becuase it shows us that Venus is important even though its a dangerous place.

The author's idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, because Venus is referred to as our Earth's twin. In paragraph 2 it states ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" Thus saying that we should learn more about this planet and how Venus functions. It states ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" This quote demonstrates how Venus can be a place we live on which the author meant by worthy pursuit.

Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it present according to the author. In paragraph 3 it says ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This means that our ""twin"" planet, Venus is way hotter than what we are used too. When the author suggests despite the dangers that means that even though Venus looks like its impossible for man kind to live there is a way and we have to not be worried.

The reason why the author suggest these things is becuase Venus has similar features to Earth. In paragraph 4 ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. This goes to show that Venus isn't that far away from dangerous. Studying Venus can't be so hard. In paragraph 7 it states ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radation would not exceed Earth levels."" This is showing us that we can learn more about Venus as in some parts does not succeed Earth in like air pressure although it is close.

To wrap this up, the journey to study Venus as the author suggests will be hard, but its the way you got there. Life is not for eternity we have to grow and push the limits. We can not be scared of dangers but improve on them so when we fall, we get back up and build up till the peek of the sky and pass any limts that stop us even if it's Venus thats what the author suggests in this passage.

0b869b2,"Using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could be valueable. It can help actors learn how to make a smile or frown look real, it can help a teacher figure out if a student needs more help just by scanning his or her face, and it can help us figure out what our friends are realling feeling.

First, movies are a big part of our life. It is never fun to go to watch a movie and see that the actors arent good they either look like they dont know what they are doing or they try looking sad and actually look like the happest person on earth. with this technology like the arthour says "" Drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage"". This shows that even just practicing a fake smile for a movie or for when you are on stage could make the play seem better than it already would be of the actors didnt know how to put on a real smile.

Facial action coding system can also be helpful in the class room so when you have a kid on the computer you can see if they are strugging and they need more help or if they are powering through it and need a bit more of a obsticle to go through. like in in the article "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confussed or bored...it could then modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This could help a teacher out cause they cant always tell of a student is having trouble. they also dont always see the when they are doing their work at home. This is like the teachers second hand man when coming to helping students get the help or challenge they need.

Lastly, you may have a friend that you cant tell if they are sad or happy because . The article states "" Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc"". You never if a friend is putting on a fake smile to keep you from getting down, but thats just hurting them even more so you sometimes have to do things yourself and get them the help they need.

In conclusion, I believe that being about to see someones emotion just by scanning their face could be very helpfull to get kids the help they need or the challenge, helping a friend get through a rough time, and making movies better. ",4

We have so much fun aboard the ships some things you might get to do are: playing table tennis, fencing,games of baseball, volleyball, and boxing. If you are not interested in those activities we also read, and play games to pass time. The best part about the job is going to all diffrent countries.

You also have to be aware that you have to do many jobs like: taking hay and oats to stalls, cleaning the stalls, and serving as night watchman ( you have to be really careful if you do that job because if it is raining the deck can be slippery and you could fall and hurt yourself.) You also get to take turns with other crew members while on the ship. When we reach the the country where we deliver the horses you get to explore many other things. Like I have explored a castle before. You also might get to ride the streets of Venice, Italy.

I hope you have read this and are happy to come. Make sure you are hard working , and are strong to carry food for the animals. We will appreciate you coming aboard to help with the animals. we hope you decide to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Thanks again , Luke Bomberger.        ",3

Less cars makes the area less compacted which allows more space for side walks and walk ways to be built into the small town that have a high population. Places such as VAUBAN Germany and French and Swiss borders and many other places will have noo street parking, driveways and home garages. Without all of the car infested thing such as spoken there will be appropiate space and routes for public transportation and makes things and place s more accessible. Instaed of having a mall along side a distant highway it can have walk ways and more space for shopping centers and people to come not having to worry about having to find a space to park or any other conflict we all would run into reguarding personally owned vehicles. Not mentioning many more abilities that will come to hand when we become car free. Becomming car free environments is a very important task also for health reasons of everyone. Riding bikes, hiking, and walking will all come a part of everyones daily activity if not while being publically transported.. Smog is also a big issue hear, agreed? For example, in Paris, there smog percentage went down 60% because they are going through the process of limiting ownership of cars.

It is guarenteed that we will benefit from being car free. Less hassal, large decrease in accidents of vehicles and in health of all around. it is a big change but but an even larger advantage.    ",3
8ea42b6,"Scientist Rafael, There's no way it was created by aliens, I think it was just a natural landform because on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos, Anyway thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all, So Scientist Rafael that's proof, that it can't be created by aliens and it's a natural landform, well that's one of the evidence.

Also, in Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo, So I think it'similar, the picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

From 1976 to 2001, the images changed into a human face formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" That doesn't mean it was created by aliens and besides, we didn't find no ancient civilization on Mars. I think it was a natural landform and that's all the evidence that i have for you, ""Scientist Rafael.""",3
a65ffd0,"For many years scientist and mechanics have been trying to create a car that drives on its own. Over the years, they have come close to creating that car, and soon they'll have is made. I personally feel like it's a bad idea to create this car, even though there are some good points to it.

I get car sick, and I'm sure many people in this world get car sick too. I have found that when I drive, I don't get car sick, one reason it that I'm keeping my mind busy and focus on driving. With self driven cars I would not be driving, so I'll get car sick, I would rather walk to my destination, than get sick and dizzy because of driverless car. However, you're probably thinking ""I don't car sick."" So letting me move on. Everyday someones computer crashes, phones freeze, or their eletronic device's battery runs out. What does this have to do with the car? Well, I'm glad you asked. If this is a driverless car it is a known fact that it'll be electronic. So imagen you're driving in the high way when you're car manlfunctions and shuts down. If you can't get you're car under controll quick enough you'll crash right in to the person in front or beside you. Technology is known to fall apart and malfuntion all the time, so most likely this driverless car will cause more accidents.

This idea of a driverless car is not all bad. There are some good things about it too. For example, texting and driving will be less dangerous, drunk people will be able to drive home without worrying about crashing, or if there is a traffic jam, you don't have to worry, because the car will provide entertainment for you. It's the future now. Of course everyone wants to take things to the next level. I just don't think we're ready yet.

In conclusion. driverless cars are a bad idea because they'll cause more car crashes, make people lazier, cause many people to get car sick, including myself, and it'll do more bad than good. The car can help with many things as well . The future is bright, the next level of future things is driverless cars. But, for right now the future is doing just fine with drivers driving a car.",3
8bb458d,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author leaves the reader to infer that exploring Venus' surface is a good idea. I believe that the author did very well supporting his claim. In Paragraph 4, the author states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" If this is true, then could Venus become like Earth once again? I believe the author is trying to say that Venus is worth exploring to see if it is able to be like Earth once more. In Paragraph 6, the author suggests, ""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough misson to understand Venus would need to get up close and person despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges."" I believe the author is correct in this statement. If we start looking at exploring Venus as a challenge instead of a risk, it could possibly give researchers more motivation to get out and explore. In Paragraph 8, the author claims, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author brought up the word ""challenge"" again, and I believe that he really thinks the challenge is worth it. I agree with him in this claim because if humans can explore Venus, I also believe we can go on to do bigger and better things with exploring our solar system. The author did a good job in making his claims and then proceeding to back them up with evidence and facts. Although he had some opinions, the article was overall well written and well put together. The author convinced me, as the reader, that exploring Venus is definitely worth a few more tries.",4
b5bc455,"The Lively Impacts from a Dead Engine

Personal automobiles and cars have played a major role throughout the world since the invention of the car in World War 2. Cars have been a very successful invention and many people drive their own every day on their way to work, school or other places their feet cannot carry them. Though the car has fulfilled its duties in making the lives of humans easier, it has also contributed to many negative events. For example, car emissions get trapped in the atmosphere and cause living things to breathe in dirty air around them. Therefore, a revolutionary idea has been spreading around the world: using personal automobiles less. The new aspect of using cars less has promoted a happier society, a cleaner environment, and an open attitude towards alternative transportation.

First of all, by establishing an agreement to decrease car use, people have been said to be happier and stress-free. The continuing congestion and traffic jams that are among most areas of the world, create an enormous amount of stress for the people driving. Many develop road rage or irritability and are unhappy after suffering from a long ride home because of traffic. Some believe that cities should become more like Vauban, a community in Germany in which the citizens have given up their cars, because those who live there are not focused on driving and are pleased living in such a manner. Heidrun Walter, a mother who lives in Vauban, portrays her love for this car-free community when she states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Rosenthal). By living in an area with little or no use of cars, the society becomes more cheerful and has less stress to cope with. In addition, with no cars people are forced to spend more of their time outside to get from one place to another. In Bogota, Colombia there is an annual car-free day, in which anyone who does use their car has to pay a fine. Many spend their day outside walking or riding their bikes to get around and believe that the car-free day is ""a good opportunity to take away stress..."" (Selsky). As they exercise more without cars and enjoy the great outdoors, they wear bright smiles on their faces and look at things with a positive attitude.

With a smaller amount of people using their personal vehicles, less gas emissions are becoming a part of the Earth's atmosphere. Humans breathe in the gases that are polluting the air and can become sick from it. The environment suffers from the dirty air and may not be able to sustain life if there is not a stop to the large amounts of pollutants being emitted into the air. In the United States, passenger cars are the cause of ""up to 50 percent"" of greenhouse gas emissions while in Europe they are ""responsible for 12 percent"" (Rosenthal). This means that the car use in the United States is ruining the air around us and assists greatly in creating a disgusting environment. In popular and global cities, pollution is even more noticeable and overwhelming. For example, in Paris smog has become an everlasting issue. The climate in the area contributes to the smog filling the air along with the use of cars: ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" (Chicago Tribune). To reduce the smog in the area, an elaborate plan was taken into action. Cars with even license plates could not drive on certain days and cars with odd license plates could not drive on the other days. By doing this, the air in Paris cleared up dramtically. Therefore by promoting a system where car usage is not as common, the environment can become healthier and cleaner, which benefits the citizens of the Earth.

Last, declining the use of cars creates an open attitude towards alternative transportation methods. Those who live in car-free communities discover new ways to reach the destinations they have reach throughout the day. Some will utilize their body and take advantage of nature by biking or walking from one place or another. Others might us public transportation or will car-pool with those who do own a car. As previously mentioned before, Colombia participates in a car free day, which means ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses"" to get where they needed to be (Selsky). Their use of other means of transportation on the day without cars, exemplifies that it is possible to live using other ways to get around. Some people are against the idea of using other transportation, but if they were to see the impact the alternatives have, they would be more accepting. These days many young people tend to get their license later by waiting until they reach their twenties, suggesting that they can live a happy life without relying on a personal automobile. Instead of using their own cars, they find other ways to get to work or school. These people become acclimated to organizing their lives ""around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends"" (Rosenthal). Younger people who commit their lives to walking or public transportation, become aware of the fact that driving a machine that can negatively affect the world is not a necessity. Their awareness then can continue passing on to each generation and can ultimately prevent the excessive use of cars throughout the world.

In conclusion, a life without cars might be a life worth living since it contributes to a stress-free society, a healthy environment, and an acceptance of other means of transportation. By relying less on cars, people can eliminate the variety of negative impacts on the world. The Earth can become a happier, cleaner, and more accepting place with a dead engine.    ",5
738a50a,"Spending gargantuan amounts of time making self-driving cars is a bad idea. Sure, there would probably be less accidents and less rule breaking but in the long run, that would cause a lot of unemployment. If people no longer have to drive themselves, that would mean that police men would not need to arrest people from the road. Although that seems like a good thing (and it is meaning that there will be less accidents), not every police man can be a detective. In that case, there would be less job oppotunities and more unemployment with, which seems to be a more important issue than having possible car trouble.

If people would be a little more responsible in the way they drive, there would be no need to make cars that drive themselves. Instead, we should be thinking more into the lines of a beter fuel source. This is why spending gargantuan amounts of time making self-driving cars is a bad idea.",2
4653b01,"Dear Senator,

Most people hear the word ""Electoral College"" and think that it is a place.. But they're wrong, it is a process. The Electoral College is widely regarded as a thing that seems to belong to the past and not to fit in the present. The advocates whom are conflicting with others are saying that the Electoral College method isn't democratic in modern day society, which is correct. The Electoral College is a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens which was founded by the founding fathers.

The Electoral College has 538 electors, but to elect the President, 270 electoral votes are needed. One for each member in the House of Representives plus two for your Senators is what your state's entitled allotment of electors must equal and the number of members in its Congressional delegation. In the Constitution under the 23rd Amendment, D.C is given 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. ""State"" can also be used instead of using the District of Columbia. Each canidate running for President in each state has his or her own group of electors. The political party is who the electors are generally chosen by but they elect them by giving them different responsibilities. Every four years is when the presidential election is held. I believe that the senator should stick with The Electoral College to vote for the President of the U.S.

When the presidential election is all finished with, the governor prepares something called ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which lists all of the canidates who ran for office in that particular state. The electoral college system voters vote not only for the president but for what we call the slate electors who eventually elect the president. Not always can voters control whom thier electors vote for and sometimes voters can get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate. Some people may call the Electoral College outdated, irrational and maybe unfair but I think it's a way to keep everything organized and it won't cause to much chaos, unless you disagree with it.

Slate of electors are trusted to vote for the President however, he or she is usually picked by the number of how many votes your electors put in for you.

Basically, everyone thinks that The Electoral College is just a big waste of time and outdated. But it's a process which elects slate of electors then those who are apart of that will vote for the president. In my opinion, I think it's a better way to handle things than to just ask everybody to cast their votes for just one person. Everyone can just work together and everything will probably work out just fine if each voter agrees on one thing!                                                       ",2
c976cb4,"The Mona Lisa is one of the greatest pieces of artwork Da Vinci has ever created. It shows great craftmanship and 83% happiness within her smile, according to a new face recognition software created Professor Huang from the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science, and Professor Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. It creates and analyzes a 3-D face to assume what the person is feeling. This could also help students in other ways, by scanning their faces and trying to help them if a problem seems confusing or difficult, but this would give them less privacy and less security. This new system may not even be accurate, in which if they analzyes and assumed wrong for the painting, then the students' expression would also be wrong, making this system completely false and unusable in any way.

First off, a painting is different than a person. You can't accurately assume what the expression is if a person painted it. The facial structure would be slighly different from the actual person, because there is no way to completely recreate a face, especially back when it was painted. It may be very similiar to the person, but it is not the same person, meaning that the software has incorrectly given this person inaccurate or false emotion in which they previously did not have.

If this software doesn't give the correct answers to a painting, then we can assume it wouldn't work a human. Humans can show more visual expression than the software can detect. There is no setting for nervousness or joy. If someone was crying tears of joy, the computer would see this differently, and say this person would be very sad instead of being joyful. Humans can also fake expressions. If someone was sad, but had a smile the entire day, the computer might sense some sadness, but not nearly enough to show they are truly sad and that the student shows more happiness than sadness as the time of scanning them.

Lastly, even if this went into effect, this is giving students almost no privacy or security when using a computer. Sure its helpful for learning in some ways, but they have to give the software new emotions like confusion. Even if the expression showing confusion is implemented, this doesn't mean its safe. From paragraph 6, it states: ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"". Why does this matter? This just gives more excuses on how student's privacy is being exploited. It's also quite useless. You could be thinking of something else besides the ad, but the computer would see that your expression is happy, so you would get a similar ad, which you may not enjoy at all. It just doesn't make any sense to put it in a computer.

This new software is a great concept and could used in many different ways that would be very helpful, but it doesn't seem advanced enough to be put inside lots of computers yet. It's also quite dangerous, since the computer is looking at everything you are doing, inside and now outside the computer even more closely.

Bringing this kind of technology into your lives could seriously damage your reputation, social life, or anything of the like if your computer got hacked. If the software is inaccurate, then when you want to use this feature on a computer, it would be wrong, making this a faulty piece of software, unable to accurately give the emotion you were hoping to give. This could lead to many problems in the future if this face recogniztion software is used in the future. It's just not good enough to be used in the real world yet. Maybe after some time, but as it is not, it's not ready. ",5

a23fdd9,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for students in a classroom to read. This new technology can tell many emotions that humans may show through their facial expressions. These emotions may include happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. It is an advantage for humans to have technology can detect the six basic emotions.

The Facial Action Coding System is able to ""identify mixed emotions"" (Nick D'Alto) meaning that the system can figure out more than one emotion at a time. This technology is valuable because not many humans can detect more than one emotion at once. The majority of the time a person can only tell if a person is satisfied or not. An average human can not detect six emotions an a time like a calculator.

In addition to this the Facial Action Coding Sysytem calculates a human's facial expression similar to a calculator. The technology used determines the subject's emotions by using percents, by using math to show the amount of possibly the subject's sadness or anger.""She's 83 perecent happy, 9 perecent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" (Nick D'Alto). It is safe to say that no regular human being can caculate another human's emotions using math in this way. That is why the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for students to read, and know about.

This new technology is so impresssive that it can also detect when a person may become uninterested in what they are doing. ""Could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (Nick D'Alto). This new tech system reads whether or not a person is engaged into what they are doing. Isn't that magnificent?

Critics may say that in fact it is not magnificent or even impresssive. The facial Action Coding Sysytem is so advanced in its self that ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (Nick D'Alto). Thus indicating that regular computers similar to the ones available at schools are not capable of calculating facial expressions similar to the ones being shown, by Mona Lisa. The author Nick D'Alto, also states that ""computers need to understand that, too"". Meaning that is would not hurt to upgrade the PC people are using, to use the coding system.

It is valuable for students to learn about the Facial Action Coding System. This sysytem was used to calculate the emotions of Mona Lisa, one of the most iconic art pieces created by Leonardo da Vinci.The subject in that painting did not show one particular emotion right away, because the subjects face was so copmplex. Mona Lisa's face was so complex they had to use an advances system to determine the subject's emoptions. Thus indicating why this new technology is valuable for students to read.   ",4

a9394d5,"Driverless cars should not be coming.

Some people may think that this is a cool and fun idea, but it is not safe for the driver or pedestrians.

There are many flaws to driverless cars that should be addressed and taken seriously.

This situation could be very dangerous.

The driverless cars cannot even fully function by itself.

Having the car be driverless someone could fall asleep from being bored or they are expecting the car to do all the work and not need their help.

If the car ended up needing human assistance, because they are not totally driverless, the person would be asleep and not take over, which could cause a wreck.

They could hit a pedestrian and get arrested or get charges pressed against them.

Even worse the person wouldn't have even been aware of what was happening beacuse they were asleep and that could have gotten them injured as well.

Another flaw to these cars is that it can cause people to become very lazy.

Everyone would get used to not having to drive themselves around so they would start expecting to not have to do even more things.

They would become very dependent of other people and things around them.

It would teach children to not learn to do things for themselves and become independent.

They would expect everything to be done for them by their parents, siblings, teachers etc.

In the passage it said they would have taxis as the driverless cars and then no one would have to have cars anymore.

If they make taxis the driverless cars and they do not need any drivers that would result in job loss for all of the taxi drivers.

Not everyone has a college degree and can get a big job so being a taxi driver is all they can do.

If that is taken away from them they are left with no job and no way to pay bills or provide for their families.

This would cause their families to go into debt and suffer just because there was now driverless cars.

Driverless cars are not something that the world should have.

They can make people lazy, are dangerous, and could cause job loss.

Just because it seems like a cool idea, does not mean it is a good idea.

Other people around the world have to be taken into consideration and all of the consequences of the cars have to be looked at and taken very seriously. ",3

I am writing this letter to you today to let you know I stroungly believe that we should demolish the process of electoral college. Why you may ask? First, it is unfair, we are the votes they not. Second, it is outdated (

""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer

) Lastly,

First, it is not fair. We the people are surposed to chose the president not some privite party that we never meet. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer ;according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- wor the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to kind we have now."" So we vote yes but he doesn't become president; do we even matter? It doesn't seem like it.

Second of all, it is very outdated. According to ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by The Office of the Federal Register this process was founded in the days of the four founding fathers. That's old! Now in days we have found better and fair ways to do pretty much every thing.

I hope this letter helps you decide on weather or not we should keep the process of electoral college.

9d5b06f,"The author of this article is only focused on one thing in this article. They describe all of these reasons on why traveling to Venus is unsafe yet completely ignores his own reasoning by replacing it with an unrealistic claim stating that astronomers want to explore it. Also, while they explain the density is the same and how Venus is ""Often reffered to as Earth's ""twin"","" they bypass the subject of how much will it cost, how it will affect the United States as a whole.

The author is failing to realise just how unsafe it is to actually go to Venus. They do go on to talk about the ""electronis made of silicon carbide,"" but it doesnt change the fact that we could not survive eight hundred degree wheather and neither could a space ship. the space carrier would melt when it came into the orbit of Venus. Also if the atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide is it really safe for anyone to go there. On Earth, we have a lot of pollution and a vast amount of carbon in the air but it is nowhere near the percentage in the article. Then you have a atmospheric pressure of ninety times more than our own. The article describes how that would crush a submarine that has been made to search the lowest points of the ocean. The article states in paragraph three, ""Also noteable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probe seeking land on its surface.""

The author is not taking into account the people who would need to go on this mission as well. We are talking about a human that if they were to get past the spot where they are orbiting that they will be faced with all of these horific obstacles. The lightning strikes would try to kill anyone who tries to find land on the surfac, yet they are trying to send people to find out about their curiosities? Are we okay with that? All of these factors will end up in a loss of a human if we try to step foot on Venus and that is not worth the curiosity of a few.

Attempting to go to Venus would be extremely costly and would be a very poor choice on our part in the long run. We are talking about putting a group of people and equipment that cost billions to trillions of dollars on a space exploration that has a vast possibility of not coming home. It would cost us a fortune and no onewould gain from it. Hypothetically, let's say the the craft landed, what are they going to have to face to get a rock and gas sample? The volcanoes, lightning strikes, and powerful earthquakes would kill everything and everyone on board before the can let out a sigh of relief. Venus may have been an Earth-like planet but as of right now, no one would benefit from an exploration there.

Venus can remain a mystery. The author writing this article is not thinking about the good for everyone and/or the possibility of it even becoming a reality. The whole article is flawed because even though we are alike in size and occasionally distance, no one has survived the landing for a reason. The planet is too dangerous for us to even think about trying to explore, so we will wait to see if factors change but for now the author wrote this article poorly. We are not ready at this point in time and we may never be but the curiosity of a few are not worth the risks.",6

While taking pictures the Vicking saw the shadowy likeness of a human face. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the very first time ever. Michael Malin and and his Mars Orbiter Camera, took picturse 10 times shaper then then from the preveous Viking picture. After that they conclued that there was no alien monument after all.

In the 2001 Viking photo its spans 1.56 meters, in 1976 Viking photo comaperd to 43 meters per pixel.

If you think that in the WHOLE universe, we are the only form of life, you're ignorant.""

Is this guy serious?

""Everyone knows that aliens are smart! They could've easily built that landform to mock humans!""

I can't take this nonsense anymore. I casually raise my hand, waiting for the majority to acknowledge it. When I feel that I've gotten enough peoples attention, I begin to talk. ""Listen. I understand that we may not be the only life form in the universe, but do you really think that aliens built that? You said it yourself man. It's a landform. A natural landform."" I slowly get up and make my way to the wall where the image is being displayed. ""Do you see this?"" I point the ""eye"" of the landform. ""This is a shadow. Nothing more, nothing less. As well as this other ""eye"" and the rest of the darkness making it seem like this landform has a face. It's just the angle of Viking 1 and where it was when the picture was taken. It just so happens that it looks like a human face. Now I agree, it is kind of weird. But Viking 1 takes a lot of photos. Don't you think there would be at least a few pictures with aliens making it? Sorry man, but your theory just isn't adding up."" There is a small appause as I walk back to my seat.

Mr. New Guy doesn't look very happy. He looks a bit relieved though. ""Well,"" boss starts speaking, ""I suppose we have our answer already. Just a simple landform. Alright guys. You all are dismissed. Have a nice night."" He begins packing his things. I get up and head out. As I get in the car I sigh. ""Well, that was a waste of time.""",2
ec31fe3,"Dear State Senator,

I believe that something should be brought to your attention. I'm concerned about the way we are handling the current election process of presidency. You see, at the moment we-us Americans-use the Electoral College. But it is becoming a major issue. I understand that ""the founding fathers established it in the Constitution."" But ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors."" Why focus all of our time choosing Electors, when we could be allowing citizens to vote directly for their President themselves. Office of the Federal Register states,""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors."" Did you realize that ""a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President""? We have millions of people in our country that could be doing the work themselves.

I understand that life is not always fair, but I do believe that as a State Senator you could use a hand. ""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party."" They could use a helping hand as well! ""The presidential election is held every four years."" In those four years, American citizens wait eagerly and anxiously to choose a potential new president. Why don't we give the people what they want? ""Most states have a 'winner-takes-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of 'proportional representation.'"" These complications could be avoided if we listened to what the citizens have to say and allowed them the freedom to vote for their president directly. America is the land of freedom after all, is it not Senator?

""According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" A recent article by Bradford Plumer says,""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best."" Rather than worrying about ""certainty of outcome"", ""everyone's president"", ""swing states"", ""big states"", and ""avoiding run-off elections"", why not just let our beloved, fortunate, intelligent American citizens be happy and choose who they would prefer run their life?            ",4
b5c8cca,"The challenge of exploring Venus showed a great amount of evidence to support both opinions, supportive of the idea or not. As we lnow venus is 170 degrees on the surface but ships can take it. Then theres the fact that no spacecrafts sent by humans has ever lasted more than a few hours on the surface of venus.

there is a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets on venus, and even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmospher.

Venus distance wise is a time consuming yet possible feet. Venus and mars are the closest neighboring plants to us and Venus more than mars shows there could have been life long ago on this planet. Venus consists of valleys, mountian ranges, craters , and many believe oceans once inhabited this planet. Talks of NASA doing a human ran investigation thirty miles aboves venus to do reaserch.

NASA belives that Venus has not easy condistions but survivable for humans. There has been talks of even sending people down there to do research in the future and that could go bad knowing the knowledge you have on this planet. the challenges would be very intimidating and unpredictable.

In the end these talks on further exploring Venus is very intresting and inthink is should be done at the right place and the right time. Us as humans are curious creatures and should have all the knowledge we can gather on these forigne planets before human exploration. A lot of questions un answered and a lot to answer.",2
89b22e4,"Throughout this article, the author explains how people in the world will no longer need to buy cars due to a driverless cars that scientists are working on. The author explains how these cars would have many sensors and would only need human assistance if it has to drive through construction zones or heavy traffic zones. The question to be asked is, would people really want have a driverless car? Driverless cars should not be sold to people due to them needing human driving, whos fault it is if a driverless car gets into an accident, and extra cost.

In the article the author states, "" In fact, none of the cars develope d so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This quote shows that driverless cars would still need a human to stay alert while on the road. This shows that driverless cars are pointless, and a waste of money. Why would a human buy a driverless car when most of the time they will be driving it?

As the article goes on, the author explains how there could be many problems if a driverless car is involved in an accident. The author explains, "" Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an acciendt. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver of the manufacturer?"" This quote explains that there is no certainty that the manufacturer would be at fault for a driverless car accident. Why would a person want to pay for an accident that was the cars fault and not theirs? Thus showing that driverless cars should not be sold to people.

The last reason that driverless cars should not hit the streets would include the cost. The author begins by stating that their would have to be many upgrades to streets and cars costing much money. He explains how a driverless car could run on a special street, but required massive upgrades to existing roads that was too expensive to be practical. Why would people want to pay much money to upgrade a road for driverless cars, when half the time they will be driving?

As this essay is getting wrapped up, readers should think about all the facts brought up to them today. Think about all the construction that happens in America. Is there ever a time when there is no construction? Due to their being constuction, driverless cars would be pointless due to human beings having to drive them through constuction. Why spend extra money, be in fault for accidents even though it was the technologies fault, and pay extra amounts of money? This is why the readers as well as I should push for driverless cars to not be able to hit the road!",4
456d528,"Driverless cars do seem like the thing today's society is pushing for in the future, but is it as good as they say it is? How would one operate such a car? How much could it cost? These are questions that have all been asked before.

""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues."" Now why pay for a car that can't fully operate itself through such tribulations? If I get a ""driverless car"" I want to be able to go to sleep and wake up parked at my destination.

Driverless cars do seem good in a sense of not being able to drunk drive, unless you put too much gas in the tank. If you know what I mean. On the note of gas, would a driverless car be running on gas or electric? Or both since it would have such high energy usage with all of the cameras. Which would spike up the price dramatically if it was electric and you'd constantly have to charge it.

In my opinion driverless cars are something that do sound fun, but at the same time dangerous. There are certain things that your car wouldn't be able to see that the human eye could. For example, what if somebody's turn signals were out so they had to use their hand. How would the car see that and know to slow down? With that question on the table who would be responsible for that crash?

So in a sense driverless cars are very cool, but seem to be more of a hastle than it's worth. I'd rather just keep both hands on the wheel and move on with life. It's also just lazy, what's the point in having a drivers license if I'm not driving the car?        ",3
b655bf5,"The future is almost here. But

it is not going to be a good one. Those driveless cars are going to be a harm. It is going to destroy this world. The cars of of the futre are going to look cool and all that but are not good for people to frive.The driveless cars that are coming are going to be to expensive, not safe, and complicated.

First, these driveless cars are going to be very expensive because they're going to be to advanced and the people are who made tthem are going to want to charge alot. Those people inventing them going to spend alot of money trying to fix the roads and the cars so they are going to hope to get that money all back by making these cars. Like in the article it states that ""...General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track."" So what the qoute says is that if they make a car that is advanced and cant run on a regular concrete road, then they will have to build a road that the car can be on. For that to happen the people who built the car will have to pay extra to make a road that is good for the car and they will have to test it. So going through all that will cost alot of money. These cars they talk about will also need alot of upgrades which will also cost money. so if a peerson wants to buy the car will pay extra just because the car has extra things like upgrades on the motor, sensors and other stuff. Also in the article it says ""Google's modified Toyota Pruis uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror,..."" So here in this qoute it says some things that they put in or updated in the car. So with all this construction of road and updating things in the car is all going to cost for the person who will buy the car. So thats why these cars will not make it because they will be ti expensive.

Then, anoher reason why im against these cars is because they are not going to be safe for the people. If they get this car it is like still driving because they still have to be ready incase of something happens. Like if there a accident they have to take control or if theres traffic they have to take control. In the article it says that ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" So if the driver has to keep a hand on the wheel they mine as well just drive it. Because what they are saying there is that the car could lose its function and drive of the road. So this car

is not safe.

Finally, the driveless cars are going to be to complicated. Becuase the car is going to have to much on it and the people are not going to know how to work it. Also people when they are in a driveless car they dont want to do anything because its supposed to drive itself but the person has to keep a a hand on the wheel and be alert and be ready to take over at anytime. And all the sensors and GPS and other gadgets is going to be alot to control. If the sensors break what are they going to do nothing because they did not build the car and they will have to go to like a certain car shop cause not anyone will be able to fix a sensor like a break or any other thing in a regular car. In the article it says that it has ""four automotive radar sensor, a GPS reciever ..."" So for all that to work the oerson will have to learn to work it and learn to fix incase of it being damaged.

So with all these reason of why im against the driveless cars i should of changed your mind maybe. thes cars are not going to be successful because they will be to expensive, not safe, and complicated, So with these three reasons people will not buy these cars. Because they are all reasonable.   ",4
58e47e2,"I am against the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. The technology is something that for a couple of years before has evolve, and it is very advance right now; but it's not 100% dependable because is not perfect. Like the article said, ""people can imitate another person's expression. I don't think that a computer is going to read someone who don't show his feelings. In my opinion it is not dependable and it is unusable.

I'll want to test one of that computers to know if that really works, but like I said, it is not dependeble. The technology is advance but it is hard to believe that a computer can read all your emotions exactly like they are. Dr. Huang said that computers need to understand that most of the human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. I don't think a computer is going to understand somthing like that.

I'm against because the technology is not 100% dependeble; technology is very useful but not very fiable. Some people can just do fake emotions and the computer is going to read it like normal I think.

Scientists are discusing further visits to its surface because they are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.

NASA has one compelling idea for sending humans to study humans. The possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface would allow scientists to float above the fray. This means flying across the planet with a bimb-like vehicle.

NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions.

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because we can have life in a different planet other than just Earth. Studying Venus will help us examine the thier circumstances and find a way to live in a different planet. This is why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit.                           ",2

Then the computer could modify the lesson like an effective human instuctor. or when you get on anybody it could see your emotion and give you something that woukld help with it. it could make video games better and in paragraph 6 it says that

""most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication so computers need to understand that to"".

Then again some people would think that its weird to have a computer watching your face 24/7. ,aybe it could turn into a robot and take over the world. we would never know but if they did come out with the facial action coding system it would be kinda cool to have videos and stuff to cheer you up if your sad if your in a good mood could send you something to make you laugh. Even if your just doing homework and it could tell that your upset or confused or just bugged out by the problem it could help you without even asking fo9r help it would help you out right away i think thats coool cause alot of kids need help on stuff like that and for teachers they cant help alot of students with work.

Then he explain some issue of landing on Venus because each previous mission was unmanned and the spacecraft could only survive for 2 hours. Then he started to talk about Venus thick atmosphere, clouds along with the temperatures and the atmospheric pressure. The reason saying all of this about Venus is a good idea becasue it gives the reader more information about why Venus would be hard to explore.

He also explains that Venus has the highest surface temperture of any the plants in our solar system.

92249e6,"Dear State Senator ,

The idea of a Electoral College sounds great at first. In all reality you have to look at the facts. People of the United States should choose who they want to for president. Only having a few hundered out of the billions of people doesnt really seem fair to everyone's opinion, I agree that not everyone's opinion is satisfactory to others.

Each candidate running for President in a certain state has their own group of electors. These electors are chosen by the political party of those candidates running. The state laws get involved by only selecting electors by their responsiblilities. So this means not every elector is involved with the process.

We voters help choose our state's electors when we vote for President. When we vote for the person of our choice we are really choosing the electors in that candidate's political party. The ""winner-take-all"" system used in most states, gives the electors to the winning presidential candidate. this system is used in all states except Nebraska and Maine which have the variation of ""proportional repesentation."" The number of electors chosen for your vote will representing your chosen candidate.

Again with the fact of having a Electoral College, the people are not really voting for the President, they are voting for a slate of electors. Then they in turn elect president.

If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for 34 Democratic electors for Kerry. Off chance that those 34 electors won statewide, they would go to Congress and Kerry would in return get 34 electoral votes. These electors can be anyone not holding publice office. Electors have their own opinion rights as well.

Our votes dont always control who the elctors vote for. This causes confusion and arguements that it is unfair in the Electoral College's ways that the people are not always voting for their president because they are giving a slight chance for electors to change that vote.

Popular vote allows the people of the United States to choose what out of the majority is best for the United State's Presidential candidate. Unlike the rules and rights of the Electoral College, the popular vote allows the voters a absolute vote. Everyone's thoughts are put in concideration instead only 270 people out of like I said billions(and growing) population.

The facts show that popular vote in the long-run will be better for the United State's state of government than Electoral College. Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. We should abolish the electoral college.

With Concideration,

A United State's citizen    ",3
f552279,"The Face is a natural landform on Cydonia. Speculators doubt NASA, and say that the landform was created by aliens. Both of these claims have evidence to support their side. One side I believe has more evidence to prove their claim.

The side that disagrees with the thought that the Face was made naturally, are called speculators. NASA has realeased information about the Face, but speculators think NASA is hiding something from them which is called bona fide. Since the very first trip to Cydonia, many people have been intreaged by the topic. As said in paragrapgh 5 , ""The Face has become a pop icon"". The idea that a face was on Cydonia made people think that there had to be a creator. The creators were aliens. The next time the Mars Orbiter Camera went to Cydonia, NASA claimed there were clouds blocking the veiw of the Face. This must have shown that NASA was hiding something. NASA also tried to say that they don't pass over the Face that often. Maybe NASA didn't people to find things out. All these peices of evidence put together must prove that aliens created the Face on Cydonia.

Scientist from NASA can help prove the speculators wrong. Speculators assume that the Face couldn't have just been created over time. In paragrapgh 12, it states that there are similar landforms created, called mesa, in America. Next, the speculators say that there were clouds blocking the veiw of alien clues during the Orbit Camera journey. Since the clouds blocked the veiw of the planet, NASA sent another camera on clear day. In paragrapgh 10 and 11 it says the camera took the absolute maximum resolution. If there were any signs of anything strange the camera would have caught it. Speculators say that NASA wants to hide the fact that there were aliens. If there were aliens then that would help NASA's budget in future journeys. The evidence provided proves thay the Face was naturally created.

After recieving both sides of the story. I support the NASA and the fact that the Face was naturally created. The speculators had their concerns about the legibillity of NASA. Speculators believed that NASA was hiding things. NASA respnoded to the critics and proved that there were no aliens. Plus, if there were aliens out there then that would help

NASA with many things. Those are the reasons why I thing the Face was naturally created.

The Face, on Cydonia, will stay a contreversial subject. There will be the speculators and doubters. There will be the supporters of NASA. Both sides have evidence to support their claims. I have picked my side. Now what will you choose?         ",4
6e85b7f,"Even though the Electoral College is known as a disaster factor, it has its benefits. The Electoral College is a process that consists of the selection of the electors. Each candidate running in your state has his or her own group of electors that are voted for. When you vote on election day, which is held every four years on Tuesday after the first Monday in Novemeber, you vote for the candidate's electors. Many politicians wanted to abolish the Electoral College because of its lack of democratic pedigree, but the college doesn't allow voters of other regions to feel disenfranchised, it avoids run-off elections, and thinks that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal. It would not be fair for a candidate to campaign heavily in a state that they know they are going to win. This does not gain them any electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows will win. This causes voters that are from the opposite region to feel as if their votes did not count, that their new president would not care about their interests or values. The president would not really be their president because of the fact that they were ignored.

Voters that are more likely to pay attention to the campaign by listening to each opposing sides that compete against one another should decide the election. If voters that voted didn't care and picked the weaker candidate, then everyone would pay the price. The knowledgable voters listen to the competing candidates and will receive the most information and attention from the candidates. This leads to a candidate worthy enough to become president, which will choose the country's decisions for the next four years.

Run-off elections, where elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast is avoided. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast, which complicates the presidential election process, but is reduced by the Electoral College to announce a clear winner. The run-off election once happened to Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992.

Many argue the fact that the Electoral College method may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state. People knowing their vote will have no effect, will have less intentions of paying attention to the election then they would have if the president picked the popular vote. Voter's in presidential elections are people who want to express a political reference and want the best for their country's future rather than people who think one vote may decide the election and disregard the point of voting.                       ",4
92c618a,"Rosenthal writes that residents are ""suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before..."". Now, few people would equate soccer moms to such pioneers as Lewis and Clark but in their own way, they kind of are. In many European cities and suburbs, people have almost completely given up driving and cars. As hard as it is to imagine a sprawling city without drive ways and street parking, it is almost forbidden in the cities participating in this experiment.

Everyone knows that cars emit greenhouse gases and it's oh so bad for the environment and blah blah blah, and we all care. We really do. But do we care enough to give up our cars? Most likely not. But we could all stand to limit our driving, and it's easy enough. If the grocery store is only a few blocks away how about riding your bike or walking? You'll get a little exercise and a little less pollution. And while you're taking this walk, imagine the silence you would hear if everybody else was also doing this and the streets were empty. ""The swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" (Source 1). Aside from just the noise pollution our buzzing motors give us, the air pollution is much worse. Cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gases in Europe and fifty percent in some North American cities (Source 1). Beijing, China, the most polluted city in the world (Source 2) which is known for its intense smog, was almost shown up by the capital of France. Since Paris' government favors diesel over gasoline, they know exactly what was to blame. Closer to home, America's second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions is due to the transportation industry (Source 4).

On the topic of big cities and driving the first picture that comes to mind is a big highway filled with honking cars and irritated drivers. Traffic. Los Angeles and New York City are only a few prime examples. Heidrun Walter, a mother in the car-less city of Vauban said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (Source 1). The stress that driving through congested roads, or even just driving at all can causes a lot of problems such as accidents. Businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza, who rides a two-seated bike with his wife says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."". In cities with little to no car usage traffic has been dramatically cut down and with it pollution and stress levels. The two day car ban in Paris, France not only cleared smog but brought down congestion, or car traffic. Bogota, Colombia has a population of seven million people who participate in the Day Without Cars to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"" (Source 3). Regardless of the rainy weather, the decrease in use of cars has sparked the construction of bike paths and new sidewalks.

Minimizing to eradicating car usage would drastically decrease resource use, wasted time and pollution outputs while steadily increasing our own safety. Maybe next time you're ready to jump right in your car, consider another method of transportation.    ",3
c002295,"The author claims that no matter the dangers that venus should still be explored. i agree becuse it is a neighoring planet as well as earths twin and could have been inhabitable a very llong time ago meaning lifeforms could have been living their or still live on venus.

venus is high radiated and very hot their atmospheric pressure is high. The thought of any person wanting to go their is dispicable because of such harsh conditions. But the author does think that venus should be explored dispite the conditions . doing so will take alot of tech we dont have yet but mechanical mechines can be used be cause they are not electrical like computers or smartphones. NASA feels that the best way to explore venus is to hover over it but in order to actually explore said planet you must get close and collect samples thhis will provide evidence for what was missed in the earlier times we tried to explore venus. Along with it being our neighboring planet is has alot of similarities such as size and shape. But also differences such as the planet being almost 800 degrees fahrenheit. The presure could be so strong it can crush submarines that are able to go to the deepest parts of the ocean could be liquefyed. venus a very intresting planet to explore so maybe one day we will be able to visit tis place and search for samples and look for unkown elements.

It is sutable to assume that NASA will still try to explore venus. And figure if their is a way to explore it and venture to et samples and find eelements and reduce the dangers in venus.",2

b567018,"Do you know what the electoral college is? I didn't know what it was or what it did until the seventh grade. Well if you don't know what it is it's a group of 538 people who vote for the next president of the United States. But I don't think we should vote for a president like this. Now your wondering, why dosent this guy like the way voting is set up? Let me tell what I think it should be.

First of all I think it removes our voting right as an American citizen. Some of you are probably asking yourselfe, ""how does this remove your right to vote?"" Well you see if the Electoral college votes and whoever they vote for wins. Your basically voting for nothing because the Electoral College is basically the vote that counts twords the election.

Another thing I would want to change is if the Electoral College is the main vote we should just not vote. Whats the point in wasting our time to vote if it doesent even count. I thi9nk voting should be by popular vote because it lets the citizens choose who they want there leader to be.

Finally I think If we could choose the president it would be better becuse the people would get what they want. If they dont get to choose there leader than there is no point in doing this stuff at all. This should be a real democracy and let the people vote.

In general I think voting should be by popular choice and not by the electoral college. As the people of the United States we need to vote for our leaders and keep our rights to vote in this country.    ",2
6271110,"The Electoral College is a system that must be changed. It is a system that takes away the people's vote in a sense. As it originated from the Founding Fathers, it is as well an outdated system, that could have a drastic overhaul. The Electoral College could be thought of as ruining portions of this democracy, granting the people to vote for a president. There could be great error introduced to such a way of selecting people for such positions. Therefore, I stand vehemently on the side that the Electoral College must change, granting the people and the government a cleaner, more reliable form of election by three contentions: it removes the thought of there being an improper ratio of electoral votes to popular votes; it is too easy for fraud to occur in the system; and because of how irrational and unfair it is.

The first reason why the Electoral College must be changed in favor of a popular vote system is because of how there is such a margin of error introduced in its existence. The opposition may argue that a popular voting system may have equal, if not a greater chance of error, but that is very inaccurate. In a popular voting scenario, things are about as basic as possible. Election results are taken directly from the people of each state, and the results are then combined and compared, in turn selecting someone into office. In contrast, the Electoral College is far more complicated, resulting in more things to go wrong. For instance, a notable example is the 2000 election between Gore and Bush. In this scenario, Gore received a larger number of popular votes, as Bush won the Electoral College. The whole practice of the Electoral College introduces so many variables to the equation, that it would just be very irrational to use such a system.

Continuing, the next reason why the popular voting system should replace the Electoral College is by the chance of ""fraud"" in such a form of election. The members of the Electoral College could be anyone. Now, this may not be thought of as fraud, however it could as well be thought of as fraud of the system. These members of the College could potentially curve the results of an election. For instance, in the 2000 election, members did not stay true to the one candidate, resulting in the possibility for in improper ratio of votes between the Electoral College and the populus. A counter of this argument may be how often this sort of thing may occur. The 2000 election was the first election since 1888 that had a similar problem. However, this sort of thing should never occur. There should never be an occasion of a problem occuring in something as substantial as a presidential election.

My final contention is regarding how irrational and unfair the entire Electoral College is. In this, there is a type of winner-take-all system set in place. This means that, in most states, if a candidate wins the state, they take the Electoral College for the state. Because of this, candidates mainly focus on campaigning in states that they have a clear chance of winning. This is extremely unfair for many voters in the states that these candidates do not even visit. They would have no evidence of what to vote on in election. This could also change an election, with disastrous results. For example, in the 1976 election, a mere few thousand different votes in both Ohio and Hawaii could have led to a tie in the election. Ties are often fatal in the Electoral College system, as delegations in Congress determine a winner of the election. A counter to this claim may be how the winner-takes-all system encourages more campaigning in the toss-up states, where close attention is set upon the campaigning individuals. However, this still does not change the fact that other states are not receiving the proper amount of campaigning to prove a fair election.

In summation, the Electoral College must be changed in favor of a popular vote form of election by three previously stated contentions. First, it provides the chance for there to be disastrous results in an election. These results may consist of there being a tie, or an improper ratio of popular votes to electoral votes, as seen in the 2000 election. To continue, my second contention is regarding how there is a chance of corruptness and disagreement in an election. With the Electoral College in place, anybody could technically become part of the College, and there may be a dispute between what member is for what candidate and such. This could be very confusing for the voters. And finally, the entire system of the Electoral College is plainly unfair and irrational. This results in the election being unfair to certain states that did not receive proper campaigning for particular candidates, as it allows candidates to choose which states they would like to take part in campaigning with. In all, the Electoral College is a jumbled, confusing mess of election and governmentation.    ",6

these cars are not 100% driveless. Second, They can be really expensive and not affordable to many and

finally, it cannot navigate through roadwork or accident in which a driver would need to take over.

These cars are not 100% driveless in the article it said that the cars would not be able to navigate through roadwork , accidents , and etc. They also can not drive in or out of driveways or handle complicated driving issues. These things could lead to accidents in which someone could get seriously injured.

Next, these cars will probably or most likely be very very explensive in which millions/billons of people would not be able to aford. Even tho it is not a serious problem i feel like most people would like to have a driveless car of there own,but because of it being expensive it

would be very very difficult. In the article it states that the Engineers at Berkeley tride to something similary as said in the pasage, ""these smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to extisting roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical"" .In the passage it also said that radar was a device on the hilltop that cost 200 million dollars

Fianlly, it wouldnt be safe. Lets say a driver was taking his driveless car to work in the morning and his lack of sleep from last night got to him in the car and he ended up falling asleep. In the passage it said that google cars werent truly driveless, that the driver would need to take over during complicated things a driveless car wasnt able to do things

like move through accidents or roadwork and if someone got lack of sleep like they guy from above then the car would get into an accident because the person would

be sleeping and this accident could lead to his death.

If we limit car usage there will be no smog. Our air would be so much cleaner. we couldnt get sick as much as we do be cause of the smog. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. they are also up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Car traffic was down to 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intesifying smog. Diesel fuel was blamed for all of the smog. the real reason is the fact that we have so many cars/trucks on the road at all times. Some of the trucks leak fuel.

There will be less traffic jams if we limit car usage. For the most part there will be less reckless driving. That also means less stress. The rise in cellphoneand car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. With all of these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. There has been shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate.    ",2

a8ed947,"Dear State Senator, most people in this country may argue that th Electoral College is well layed out system in which according to source #3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a president ""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states"", which means presidents are always looking for support from small states, which is based on population, to be voted for because in the big states little to no votes are accepted by the Electoral College. I disagree, I believe that this method is wrong and unfair for the peope so I argue against it.

To begin with, according to source #2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races on the ""swing"" states"", this means that in some states one candidate might have a better chance of winning than the other candidate and even though a candidate is at disadvantage because the other takes all the votes because of the electoral college that candidate might win and the people of that state will not even know who is this winning candidate until they see him on tv as an actual prsident, which probably means that the winning candidate won't help that state because he does not know well enough about it. Additionally, acording to source #3 ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney ws in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plularity in states that he knows he will win"", this means that in order to win the presidency a candidate must get to know other regions but because in this case Mitt Romney vs. Barrack Obama, Obama was the regional favorite for the North Romney was at a disadvantage, which is what the Electoral College ultimately wants.

To conclude with, I think that the method of using the Electoral College to elect presidents is wrong and unfair. Furthermore, according to source #2 ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdate, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality"" this means that the electoral college is just not fit for the modern democrat world of today and mostly people argue against it.

86d40fb,"The author discusses the good and the bad of these cars. The author talks about how they could easily replace buses and/or other methods of transportation. Though the author also states that some of these methods can be costly and impratical. I think that driverless cars should not be developed further. For the reason that it would be much safer with drivers and we do not need to change much then.

With a driver behind the wheel, the driver would be much more effective at keeping themself safe. The driver can see the oncoming cars, traffic, or construction and avoid them. The driverless car could possibly not be aware of some of these conditions and then wreck the car. The sensors on the driverless car could also malfunction while driving and result in the same effect. The driver could just work around all of it and not have to rely on their car to keep them safe. The author even states that right now these situations require human skill rather than the car doing it all.

If we were to have these driverless cars, we might have to change the roads to allow these to work. Changing all the roads to work with these cars would be very costly and take quite a while to finish. We also have to worry about putting new laws into place about safety. Like the author says, if someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer. Would the driver be at fault because they were in the car, or would the manufacturer be at fault because the car's technology failed?

To conclude, the driverless cars should not be further developed. They could potentially put a person in danger, they would not be very cost effective, and a lot would need to be changed. We do not need to change if we already have a system that works well for the most part. The driverless cars would be pointless.    ",3

The author is taking in facts about Venus and still asking questions. The author isn't going for anything less.

The author begins to add the ""howevers."" Which indents to come up somewhere in this article. ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions."" ..Then

the reasoning starts to approch; ""Because most forms of photography anmd videsography ineffective."" It's like a cycle through this whole article. The author brings out the facts then the reasoning behind it.

With supporting the facts, the author tends to go back into the pass sometimes telling us how it use to be back in those times as well. ""These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II."" Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexabile and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. I like how the author is very careful with the wording and how she/he puts things.",4
1e19e64,"My postion on driverless cars are simple reasons why i dont trust them .I wouldnt feel safe walking down the treeet know ing that a driverless car is driving 25-30 miles next to me and them mess up and hit me. There are so many reasons why we shouldnt and here just a few .

I feel that driverless cars have some faults because for some big reasons succh as if we get into and accident who would know what happened would it be ther car or the driver and it would take a long time to figure out .

Another reason would be that if they had driverless cars we wuld have to have a special liscense and so many people would have to retake the driiver test and so much more. Its crazy because the fact is this that people would have so much of a harder time of driving the driverless cars because you never know when the car will mess up and you have to take over theres so much little detail that we havent worked out yet .

I feel that if we were to have driverless cars that people wouldnt know how to act that some people would be stupid with them and we already have a problem with texting and driving, i feel like his would bring the same concept to people .If we can be hand free with out driving it would be crazy people would be doing the craziest stuff if they were hand free.

Then there the way in part of the article it said ""even if traffic laws change we would need new laws to in the case of an accident "" so why do we need smart cars when in all reality we just need people to pay atttention to the road .Fot my conclusion i feel that were fine with cars that have a driver and that i feel its more safer than driverless cars .",3

""Then I guess we have to to hurry up if we want poeple to join the Seagoing Cowboys program."" said Luke excited. When the ship finally arrived Luke and Don went out to get a quick snack, and while at it convincing other people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

As soon as luke and Don found a place to get a quick snack both had a bit of an issue. Both Luke and Don we're on the other side of the room becasue of all the poeple in there. ""It's full in here. A million poeple must be in here!"" ,yelled Luke . Don heard luke's joke but thought that it wasn't very funny. Don yelled ""We should start convining poeple to join the Seagoing Cowboys program."" Luke Shouted ""Yes I think we should. ""

Both Luke and Don had not been quite lucky .Only three poeple wanted to join . "" We should try another time. "" ,said Luke . The men that wanted to join , signed up and got the job. "" We're going to reach land in a couple of days."", said Luke ""Well for now we work hard on our jobs right now."" , said Don . The crew had a meeting that the Seagoing Cowboys we're running low on men. All have either died or had retried.

When Luke arrived at the Station, Luke couldn't wait any longer for Don so Luke left him behind . Luke was determined to get more men on the crew. Luke went to lots and different places. Today Luke felt luckier now that he was carring a rabbit's foot for luck with him. I must get lots of poeple on the Seagoing Cowboys program. At the end of the Day,Don was desperteand worried for Luke if he was or wasn't going to make it on time. The boat was leaving Luke shouted that he found lots of poeple that wanted to join .

From that day and on the crew was careful and cautious. And had dozens more poeple wanted to join because war was happing again.

4fb4ef6,"I think driveless cars should be developed. These cars can take the driving out of driving. They can prevent accidents before they begin. As stated by the article, ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" This shows that even with half a million miles driven, the car is still safe.

First, these cars prevent accidents before they happen. Once they are more developed you could sleep in your car while it travels down the rode. The article states, ""It uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" This technology can warn you when there is danger and keep you safe.

Next, the driver can be interertained while waiting on their turn to drive. These companies are thinking of ""Bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" The article also states that ""Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over."" This will keep the drivers entertained and safety a ""big concern.""

However, these cars cannot be driven without a human just yet. They cannot pull in or back out of a driveway. But there are many advances in technology happening today. ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" These advancements aren't too far away.

I think these cars should be developed. The advancements are underway and should be here by 2020. These cars can entertain you, keep you safe, and save you money on gas. Once they are driverless you can also sleep in them. I hope these cars are developed because I want one of my own.    ",3

Few scientist are wanting to put these in schools so teachers know what the students are feeling about there class if they sleepy or bored the teachers will be able to know because of the computer.

First, to have this new technology in class is valuable. It's valuable because will be able to understand there student more and if they need help because with the new technology they will know that. If the students need help the computer acknowledge that the student is confused and teacher can go and help them even though they might say they dont need it the facial program will identitfy that they do. It is benefical to both teacher and student because they will be able to know if the person is down or sad depending on how their facial expression is and how they are in need of help of some sort.

Second, the way this new technology works is it uses the way your face is constructed. It using your cheek bones they way you smile and the way you get your wrinkles when you do. But it takes a few scientist to figure it out like Dr. Paul Eckman is the creator of FACS. He has classified the six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgusted, fear, and sadness. They all have very basic but common features but not a whole lot. For example, when youre mad your mouth shrinks and your face tightens up. Which is called your orbicularis oris around your mouth.

To wrap this up i am for this. I think teachers can use the help with this new technology.      ",3
a7fee66,"Venus aka the evening star is one of the most stunning and complex plant we have in solors system. The reaeon why it is stunning and complex is because of how closely the density and size and also occasionally closest to the sun and in distance too, Earth, venus, and mars which make a challenging place to even examine more closely.

The reason why venus is such a dangersous place to pursuit studying up closer is becacuse of hot it is. The atomsphere is about 97% thick making cardon dioxide cover down on venus with strong persureof 90 times greater than what humans experience as it reads on paragraph 3. Another reason why its a challenge are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atomosphere which is a type of rain that is acid which is very harmful. But the overall temperatures is a average of 800 degrees fahrenheit. The terrians or surface of venus are like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking on its land which is supported by the author on paragraph 3

But it is it posslbe for us to study the up close the unbarably hotest of venus and fully understand the plant true mysteris, and the answer to that question is a 50% 50% yes and no. The reason why it is because arcodaring to NASA and the author on paragraph 5 they state that since 1940s during WWII NASA have been working on studyings and projects. Like looking back at old technology called ""Mechanical computers"" and these deveices help and play a role for 1st roll of envisioned. But mainly the ""Mechanical computers"" are upgrade to more modern computers that enormously powerful, flexible, and quick but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme condititons like venus supported by paragraph 7.

But overall these are the reason why is hard and complex to studying venus in a up close postion.    ",3
8605f18,"In the passage the author gives facts and statements to pursaude us that exploring Venus is wortht he trip. The author includes details on how we could do it, and how difficult it would be.

This passage includes the author stating how he thinks it would be beneficial to go to Venus, he thinks it would be very interesting to be able to explore this planet. He knows it would be extremely dangerous and hard to explore Venus. He says in the passage that there are ways of keeping information with out electronic devices, in paragraph 7 he states ""systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.""

I personally think the author did a very well job of telling how exploring Venus would help us, but yet every adventures has its dicfficulties. In the reading he is trying to tell how its dangerous, but its do-able. With out preparing and studying, there will be no trip. They want to get closer to venus to be able to find out what the planets texture is like, but as of now they would only be able to hover over it in a ship. Scientists want to figure out ways to get on Venus by using machines that can withstand the weather on the planet, in paragrapgh 6 the author states ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.""

1c0a106,"The point of view on driverless cars vary from many people. In my opinion, I don't think that driverless cars are such a good idea. I think that we have found out that not all manufacturing works. There have been wrecks from people actually driving the car because something went out on the car such as brakes. The driverless car could just go out because it is all electric and it relys on the internet. The internet doesn't work all the time, for example I could be going down the road and be on my phone and only have two bars and my phone would not work. The problem could be worse, since I live in Indiana there is a lot of corn fields and country roads, so what if I am going down a country road and there isn't any type or form of internet?

There is a part in the story about how it is illegal in the states of California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia to even test out the theory of driverless cars. I agree with those states, but I also think that it is dangerous and if the system crashed in all these cars it would be really dangerous. There is also a part in the story that catches my eye and it talks about the GPS reciever and the intertial motion sensor and all those things. I have went on vacation and my GPS has lost signal and lost battery or just broke plenty of times, how would it be any different in a driverless car?

The positive sides to driverless cars is the people that text and drive really don't have to worry about wrecking because the car is doing everything for you and you really wouldn't have to watch the road. The other positive side to this driverless car is that there are antilock brakes which means that they are sensors and the story gives us evidence that it has been advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids and rollovers. The story provides us more information about the antilocks, ""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control more than a human driver can manage alone."" I think that that is huge when it comes to driverless cars, it helps with the little wrecks that turn into big wrecks.

The next positive thing that I think for the ddriverless cars is that it could help tremendously with the drunk driving people do. I have experienced my own situation of a drunk driver just recently and they passed away from it. The driverless cars could stop them from swerving all over the road and going to fast. The amount of drunk driving people do is ridiculous and doesn't just put their life in danger but everyone else on the road also. The driverless car is genius for things such as people having their mind on something else such as they get caught off guard to easy or that just hate driving or they are scared of driving.

In conclusion, the points of views from negative to positive vary in multiple ways and it depends on what you personally think. The driverless cars could be the future and make a huge difference to the world but I still think that the driverless cars have a lot of work to do with the system. I also think that it is a good idea to just keep the cars that you drive yourself because that is all anyone knows how to do. I think for now we don't have to worry about the driverless cars, but maybe in the future we something might change. ",4
bfa8186,"What's the first thing you think about when you see a car? How much gas mileage its has? What year is it? How fast can it go? Well, have you ever thought about how much polution it puts into our air that we breathe? Or the car bill you have to pay every month? I'm going to assume you don't. There are ways we can change this problem and im going to prove how!

To begin  this argument im going to point out that over 77% of American people are in debt in their car bill, ALONE. That's over 3/4 of our population in the U.S. You cannot tell me people are not stressed from this over whelming statement! ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."", said by a former car owner Heidrun Walter. She now rides bicycles with her two children and now a car bill is one less thing she has to worry about in her hectic life.

Another advantage of limiting car usage would be do reduce smog polution. Now this is not only a problem in America, it's all over the world. Paris is particularly bad in this division. Paris typically has more smog that other European capitals. It got so horrible they has to enforce a ""driving ban"" to ensure all the air was clear in the global city. It even rivaled Beijing, China which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. After about five days the congestion on the streets plumitted down to 60%.

Having said that, not only is car usage bad for our earth, we could benifit our health from it! In Bogota, Columbia they set up a program named ""Car free day."" Millions of their citiznes hiked, climbed, skated or took bus transportation to work. This day left the streets empty with no traffic, and the people that did drive had a $25 fine. Rain or shine nothing could stop these people from participating in this event. The city benifited from this so much that parks and sport centers have boomed from high demand because people want to have a healthier lifestyle in general. One day they hope every city has something simlilar to this day so that our owlrd will be heathier and even happier!

Therefor it is clearly obvious of the advantages we would have if we limited on car usage. People  would be alot healthier not only from the excersise, but the air would be alot more cleaner to breathe in. Also it would be safer and cut down tremendously on deaths. We might just be over the peak of driving.    ",4

For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on there faces"" Another thing why I think this type of technology is going to be useful, Is because maybe in the future all of the work could be handed over to the technology, Letting the technology do the work for us, Which would make it much easier for humans and less stressful to think about.

b3c88fc,"In the arcticle it states how driverless cars are in planning and in the process of being made. Technology is increasing every year and I believe by the year of 2020 it will be more advanced than it has ever been. I have to say in my opinion I am against driverless cars.

I have my reasons of why I am against driverless cars.

In the text it states that the driverless cars in the making still require human ability.

I believe that humans should be in control of the car so their is no malfunction.

I would not trust the car driving on its own.

Technonoly is not perfect their are screwups, and one screwup from a driverless car can cost the life of someone.

Driverless cars dont just have cons though they have pros.

One pro is that if someones is drunk they can get in the car and not have to control it and having the risk on getting into a dangerous accident.

According to the text it says that the car system is a safety feature. This can be true, but everyday technology advances, and humans become more and more accustomed to it.

Though technology is a wonderful thing to use and have, I believe that it is also harmful.

Now in this time period we are used to technology doing things for us, this can lead us to not think for ourselves or do things for ourselves.

Back in the old times humans did things for themselves some of the greatest minds of our times changed the world and how we live today but if technology begins to increase and think for us humans wont be able to learn for themselves or experience different things.

Our mind will be closed off from the world.

Our creativity level can decrease.

One thing that most of us go through and experience is driving.

In the text it claims that the cars have navigating systems that will lead the car to go where we want it to without driving.

We wont need our sense of direction or our thinking to solve where to go to get to our destination.

The whole point is we will not use our brains and think for ourselves but we will let technology think for us.

We will not increase our minds in the sense of obtaining more knowledge because we wont know or have a clue of what to do.

We will simply be cut off from learning or experiencing things or situsations for ourselves.

These factors play a major part in day to day life.

A driverless car is the start to that.  ",3
ee48efd,"Driveless cars would be a good car if only the driver didnt have to wait to drive or if the car would not wreck on its own. Driveless cars dont seem like the most consistent cars at the moment. These cars seem cool, but have many cons included. These cars would put you more at a death risk than you driving yourself.

The driveless cars seem to be dangerous and incosistent. The reason for this is because when the car is driving its self, the driver has to take the wheel at any moment. The reason this is dangerous is because some people could fall asleep waking up early to go to their job and they wont want to be as alert as needed. People would never know when they are about to get into a wreck if they ever did because they arent in conntrol of the vehical. The manufactures of the vehicle should be held responsible is this machine crashes or causes death. The car can only hold up under specific conditons, but what if you need to go somewhere and there is ice on the road or you need to get somewhere fast. Being in a hurry with this car is a problem. The car only goes 25 mph. This means that you will have to wake up early if going to an appointment or a far distance area. You wont be able to take highways either.

These cars have great features, but also have many cons. People need to come to consideration when buying one of these cars. think about your life and what you are risking. People should not buy these cars into safety issues and driving speeds are fixed to standard cars. ",3

I'm a scientist and there are some explanation to why this face exsict on both sides. My side is that the face on mars could be seen wrong, it could be a pile of rocks, and there is many wierd things on this planet with weird shapes, it cant always be martians or aliens.

So to start this off it could be a alien but there is a strong possibility that its not either. First the face is way to larg to be an actual face, it say it the artical the it is measured in meters, thats almost impossible. It also says in the artical that the face on mars was just an illusion caused by the shadowing on the rocks to make it look like a face. If you look furter into the artical it says that everytime they went across the planet that it looked exactly the same.

It is a real debate on whether the face is real or not.

Have you ever been looking up in the sky and see somthing that youve never seen before? Well thers a good chance that was Venus. Venus is the one of the neighboring plantets next to earth and also the most simular. In "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author talks about how NASA has been studying Venus and there plans on it.

First of all, Venus is the second planet from the sun and is somtimes called the ""Evening Star."" In the passage the author tells of how Venus is called Earths ""twin"" because of how simular both a made, with both of them having around the same size and density.

Next, the author was able to tell why getting to Venus was the actuall hard part. Venus has been hard for NASA to figure out mainly because of its atmosphere and ground conditions. In the story the author describes how Venus's atmosphere is mainly made up of carbon dioxide and that the clouds on Venus are made up of sulfuric acid which is corrosive. Then if you where to make it to the ground the avergae temperature is said to be around 800 degrees farenheit. So thats why in the passage he described Venus as inhospitable.

Finally, NASA has been trying to make trips to Venus but most dont make it through the atmoshere or only last a few hours on the ground. But as said by the author NASA has been brainstorming ways they could get to Venus and collect data. One idea mentioned by the author is that NASA would to make a blimp like object that houses people in it to hover above Venus's atmoshpere making them unharmed while they collect data. Another idea is that they would use technology back from WWII which didnt use electronics but gears so that putting that on Venus's atmoshere wouldnt break down as fast due to it's conditions.

In conclusion, the author states good evedince that in the future we might be able to know more about Venus and maybe even send people there. With knowing more about its physical properties NASA might be able to do more missions's there and maybe even send a person there.",3

77658a1,"How could a computer help improve a student's time in class? The new Facial Action Coding System developed by Prof. Thomas Huang enables computers to transfer human facial expressions into emotions. This is a valuable technology system for teachers and students to help improve learning and teaching inside of a classroom.

The new technology could greatly improve student learning inside the classroom. In the passage Dr. Huang predicts that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Such a technology could help teachers and students both. This would enable the teacher to slow down the lesson to help students catch up and learn or this could help teachers impliment new strategies to keep students focused and interested in learning. A teacher could possibly be able to tell if students are confused or bored but with this new system a teacher could be fully able to control the class and keep students attention.

Another way that the new Facial Action Coding System could help is to see what students understand a topic and what students need extra help, one on one with a teacher. This would help improve a students time in class by making the student more efficient and also could help teachers become more efficient with time. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" By having a computer in class a teacher could use the time with the students more effectively and this would translate into better homework and test grades from the students. In addition to just helping students with the class the system would allow teachers to see if a student is sad or upset and the teacher would be able to try to improve the students mood. A student who could be helped emotionally at school will value the new system and all of the capabilities of such system.

In online classrooms where the students do all work on a computer, the computer could generate strageties for each individual student based on a students emotions and facial expressions. ""If you smile when a web ad apears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."" This would allow a computer to give students a better opportunity to learn at the pace that suits that student on that particular day. This could also allow the instuctor of the class to institute different styles of lessons and more entertaining ways of learning the content of the class.

All of the capabilites of the new Facial Action Coding System are extremely valuable to not only students but also teachers. Being able to learn better within the classroom will be greatly valued by students and also teachers. Also a more direct learning experience with a better connection from teacher to student. Finally, better strategies for teaching and learning could be developed with the new technology system. All of the possibilities are very valuable to students in a classroom. Let's improve the education of students.",5
87d51ad,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a valuable technology in that it can recognize emotions in humans and even paintings that even humans sometimes are not able to. The FACS can is a whole new discovery and tool to the psychological world of emotions because it is able recognize and calculate emotions. It is unique because although humans are able to recognize their emotions up to a certain point, they cannot calculate the exact or even the closest approximate to the emotions they feel. That's where the technology is becomes valuable because it has the ability to recognize and calculate the emotions of a human or a photo.

One may argue that the FACS is would not be effective or valuable because it is a programmed and minipualated system. While that may be true, the system is programmed to be as close to the real human facial structure as possible. The 3-D computer model face has 44 major muscles, all of them made to move like real human muscles. The work and credibility of the making of this system is credited largely to Dr. Paul Eckman, the psychologist who created the FACS and classified the six basic emotions. The FACS system can also tell the difference between a forced facial expression, such as a smile, as opposed to an unforced one based on the movement of one's facial structures. Thus, as stated in the article, ""these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

This technology can help psycohlogists, doctors, or even friends and families better understand a patient or a loved one. Doctors can diagnose a patient more accurately due to a better understanding of the patient with the system. Friends and families can also use the system to have a better bond with each other through better understanding of emotions. Most humans are not able to express, or even recognize, their emotions through words and words can get lost in translations. This technology is valuable to the future of society in the sense of human relationships with each other and doctor diagnosis by using the psychological aspects of a patient.",4
72efb15,"Dear state senator, I believe that election by popular vote for the president of the united states is the smartest and easiest way to go about things. There are many people who believe that it is the better way to go about things given that the electoral college is a waste of time or so some may say. Over sixty percent of voters back in two-thousand would have perferred a direct election instead of voting to a bunch of electors. I mean would you rather vote for one person or vote for twenty-six.

The electoral college is a place that the founding fathers established in the constitution as a compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting, where they vote for president and vice president, and counting the electoral votes by congress. The college consists of five hundred-thirty eight electors and a majority of two hundred-seventy votes is required for the election of a president. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.

Under the electoral college the people vote not for the president, but for the slate of elector, who in turn elect the president. The electoral college is unfair to the voters because of the winner-take-all system. During the two-thousand campaign, seventeen states didnt see candidates at all. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all have the same thing in common, they want to abolish the electoral college. Some electors even have the nerve to occasionally refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

So i hope that explained alot on how the electoral college is not a good way to vote. That way is to long and people might not get filled in on what happened or who won or there vote might even get changed. One of these days the electoral college will be gone and it will just be the president winning by having more votes. We dont need all that confusing way of voting just a simple vote and the winner is the one with the most votes.    ",2

If i have to put my child's life into someone elses hands it would not be a computer. Now I am not saying the machine can not do it's job. I am siply saying in my opinion there are to many things that could go wrong.

Someone could hack it for instence. They could run the vehicle of the road, or ey sencers could nowfunction. Say you are going down the road and a little kid runs out infront of you. In a regular car in i can brerak every time, but in a driverless car if the fuse is bad or a wire is loose it may not tivate the breaking system, becuase the sencer was not working. Now imagion for me if you will that kid that ran out in the road was your own child. Young and inocennt with so much life before him/her. Would you really want a driverless car to be the one it ran out infront of?

Now I know people do not always drive safe or pay attention eather, if we inforced the laws we already have in place to protect or children and others. We could make the streets and eventually our beautiful nation safe once more, becuase today our nation is in to big of a hurry, and we forget what it means to take it slow and enjoy life. So i say no. We do not need driverless cars becuase it would only end badly.",2
ea25d94,"In Making Mona Lisa Smile, the author describes a new way technology could identify human emotions. This new technology is called the Facial Action Coding System, it can tell what emotions people have by scanning their faces. In this article he states that this could be applied to classrooms. I do not think this is a good idea in the sense that they are spying on kids and adjusting to how they feel.

One of the main reasons I do not think this is a good idea is because it would not make any sense. You would spend a bunch of money on something that would not really help kids out that much. We have programs for kids like that who are slower at learning than others. When he says that kids are going to get bored and it will change the lesson, but he does not know that kids are going to get bored of school no matter what.

I think that it would be wrong to have this in classrooms because they would be in-effective. I think that it would be in-effective because they would not care about it in the first place, or they would wait for something they know and could use to their advantage. Some kids would wait for it to change if they do not know the answer or do not know the lesson, so they would be able to get it done.

One thing that this could be used for is it to help out countries to figure out what other nation leaders and enimies are thinking, or how they are feeling. It is a nice program but I think it will not work for in-school applications. I think it would get in the way of kids learning. The system is actually pretty cool but I do not think that it should be used in education.",3

""The Indefensible Electoral Collge: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are worng"" By Bradford Plumer says "" The single best argument against the elctoral college is what we might call the disastor factor"".

This just shows how unfair it is. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are worng"" By Bradford Plumer says ""Can voters control whom their electors voe for? Not always.""

This basically says it is possible for u to have no input in what u vote for. If your vote does not count then why should u vote. The system doesnt work and needs to be tossed. The whole point of americas goverment is that your voice matters but apparently the electral collge is free from the rule.

The electoral college is out of date acorrding to the article.

In the article the authors reason to explore Venus is "" human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author is trying to explain to the reader that this could be the first step to space exploration and could lead to the exploration of the rest of our solar system. A mission to Venus would also lead to great break throughs in science. The new information and data found from collecting rocks and other materials on Venus could benefit many lives back on Earth. Exploring Venus would also create new understandings of science and physics and help scientist understand how different properties work with each other. This could lead to new medicines that could save lives all around world and could also lead to new technology that wold benefit humanity as a whole.

Hundereds of people think that there was a human head on Mars, but from what astronomers had to say about it, it was the truth. In 1976, NASA got their first look at the ""face"" on Mars. A couple days later NASA relased the image of the ""face"" to the public the caption was simple as it states in the text, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" After that, it was a pop icon, attracting people into learning more about this planet.

The ""Face on Mars"" became very popular when it came to scaring humans. According to the text it states ""It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" In films, as always, Hollywood would ""tweak"" the truth to have more people come and see the movie. This was partly the cause of people believing that there is life on mars. However, astronomers are saying that there could have been life on Mars because, of dry river and lake beds on the surface of The Red Planet. Still, that does not prove that there were marshans.

Astronomers are still trying to convince people that there is not life on Mars. According to the text it states ""What the picture actually shows ins the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West.""

f816ace,"There are many advantages and disadvantages of limiting car usage according to reading passages about limiting car usage. many people think that car usage doesn't need to be limited because everyone loves their car, but everyone loves their life also.

What I mean about everyone loves their life is that people fail to realize that cars are troublemakers, they cause alot of problems, and that is  pollution. Pollution from anything is very harmful especially  to the people who don't have transportation and they have to walk or ride a bicycle to their destination. In many states the usage of cars are banned and thats because their pollution rate is horrific. I mean who wants to live somehwere where you cant even walk your dog because of the pollution from the automobiles?

In Paris on Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22- euro fine ($31). But the same would apply to odd-numbered plates the folowing day. Futhermore, in Paris almost 4,000 drivers were fined and Twenty-seven people had their car impounded for their reaction to the fine. Paris has more smog than any other European capital.

Did you think that Paris was the only country that has banned cars?, Well you thought wrong because Bogota, Colombia has banned cars for three straight years and only left with buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. Bogota, Colombia goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog violators face $25 fines. In 1990 The Days Without Cars is part of an improvement campaign that began to help decrease the essecive amount of smog or pollution. Since the help to decrese the amount of smog parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and they have built new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

After all I am here to say that many states are banning the usage of cars because they send off large amounts of pollution and pollution is a very harmful depris that can harm many people and it can cause sickness, and possibility death. If you are living or moving to a different state that bans car usage I strongly encourage you to let your car sit in the garage and look pretty because we are trying to save our people, plants, animals, and most important our communities.

Tan on a nice summer day with a nice 80 degrees Fahrenheit, life is good. On Venus the temperature can reach 100 times that, 800 degrees fahrenheit.

Venus use to have water, and could maintain life a long time ago. Now the surface is hotter, all the water is gone, no space rover can spend more can couple of hours before being destroyed. This challenge more difficult then anyone can think of. The is just so much more to explore in Venus.

Sciencetist can study lots of things about Venus. Can't judge a book by its cover. Venus sound hard on paper, our technologies are getting better. The idea of floating on top of the clouds, is just amazing. Its more safer then landing on the ground, and not a lot of damage is going to accure to the astronaut equiments. The good thing is that, it hovering 30 miles or more above the surface. No need to worry about

storms and other kind of desassters.It will be powered by the suns energy, not much battery power needed to make the machine more heavier.There are some downsides to the idea of floating above the ground, the air pressure would be close to sea levels on earth. The scienctists who observe rocks wouldn't be able to take rock sample.

If the astronauts can make it to Venus, it wont be long to check out mercury. There might be other planet more hotter then Venus, but step by step we can do it.

It explains the very hostile living conditions that one can face while living or being on such a planet. Venus is part of our solar system and it is the second planet from the sun. Venus is kind of like Earth in a way because they have some sort of relations to each other, expect for the fact that if you go and try to live there you may crushed or even liquefied. No one would be able to stay on Venus since it is considered to have the hottest surface temperature than any planet in our solar system.

The author makes really good points on why studying Venus can have a great outcome despite the dangers it may bring with it. In the article it states that astronomers are fascinated by Venus since it may have been very similar to a planet we live in. They get to discover if Earth really could of supported any types of life long ago. The author says that Venus could be one of our nearest option to go explore and also since it is considered as Earth's ""Twin"".

Exploring Venus may be a challenge but The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, also refered as NASA, were thinking on sending something like a vehicle to float just enough the surface of Venus. They decided on something like that to avoid any bad conditions that are said to happen. Even though when floating up in the surface they wont be able to have physical evidence from the planet like samples of rocks but they are able to provide insite on how things are in Venus. In the article it states that the scientists are wiling to take the risk to go study this planet to be able to learn more about it.

In conclusion, the author supported the article very well on how studying Venus can provide valuable information and that they should go ahead and study it. There are challenges on the way such as the horrible conditions if they do decide to pursue but there are ways around that. They also have more than one idea they can use if one dosen't go as planned like simplified electronics that will be able to survive the pressure, heat, and may other forces that Venus has to offer. They should go for exploration because it could bring more knowlegde and insite on the ""Earth's twin"" than just the predictions that were made in the past. ",4
8e49acb,"Have you ever read the story A Cowboy who rode the waves? I know I have, it's a book about a boy who is invited to Europe and he becomes a Seagoing Cowboy after World War 2. This book includes being a Seagoing Cowboy, the Seagoing Cowboy has to take care of animals on a ship and a boy named Luke explores

First, the Seagoing Cowboy, a Seagoing Cowboy is a Cowboy who takes care of animals over sea or on a boat. The Seagoing Cowboy in the story was no different he took go care of the animals. Everyday he watered and fed the animals 2 to 3 times a day. When Luke first became a Seagoing Cowboy he knew it was going to be alot of hard work so he worked as hard as he could. I can infer that if Luke had not took good care of any of the animals they all would be dead.

Next, Luke Bomberger explores, in the story,it states that Luke visited Europe, China and he explored the Atlantic ocean. and also the text states that Luke also found time to have fun aboard the ship, especially on the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. I can infer that if I was a Seagoing Cowboy I would not survive working as hard as Luke did.

Last, Being a Seagoing Cowboy,by reading the text,being a Seagoing Cowboy is alot of work. In the text it says being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened the world to him. And in Luke's own words he said It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs. Also being a Seagoing Cowboy can be dangerous because when Luke was night watchman on a rainy night, he slipped on a ladder and cracked his ribs but thankfully he didn't fall in the Atlantic ocean because their was a small strip of metal along the edge of his side. I can infer that if that small metal strip was not there Luke would most likely be dead.

Now you know how the Seagoing Cowboys worked, how they took care of animals and how Luke explored. Now, if you want to achieve something like Luke did then get out there and show everyone that you can do what you dream to do.",3
462b85d,"Since the 1900's cars have been an integral part of our lives. It seems everyone has one nowadays. But this overuse of cars is starting to have a negative effect on our enviroment and is causing mass traffic jams that put cities on halt. We as a society must start limiting our car usage to help save our enviroment and to stop traffic jams that do not let the city run smoothly.

Cars were and still are one of the best inventions man has ever made, so it is understandable why people would have such a hard time letting go of something that is so useful. But one must understand that although the car is useful it is also hurting other things, whether it be inadvertant or not. Cars have always been bad on the enviroment, now so more then ever. According to

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars passenger cars are responsible for 12 % of greeenhouse emissions and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States. This shows that we as a society are one the of the main reasons why are enviroment is crumbling around us. These greenhouse emissions and mass pollution by cars are hurting the enviroment whether we want it to or not. Everybody must take a look at these numbers and see the negative effect they are having on the enviroment and realize that by simply not using a car they can help save the enviroment. Another example of the bad effects cars have on the enviroment can be found in the article

Paris bans driving due to smog.

In the article it talks about how Paris had to enforce a driving ban due to the amount of pollution in the air from cars. The fact that a driving ban had to be implemented to stop pollution is absolutley ridiculous. This alone should show people that refuse to see the negative effects they are having on the enviroment around them that car usage should and must be cut down. By simply cutting down our usage of cars we as people can help save the enviroment. Who would not want to be a part of that?

Cars have always been viewed at as the best mode of transportation. Everyone believes that their car can always get them to the place they need the fastest. But what most people do not think about is the mass traffic jams in cities that the usage of cars can cause. If people simply cut down there car usage and try out other forms of transportation it actually could get them to the destination they want the quickest. An example of this can be found in the article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota.

In the article it says when they banned cars for the day the huge traffic jams in the city suddenly went away. This allowed people on bikes and buses to actually get around quicker than they usually could with their cars. So by not using cars people actually got around to the places they needed to be due to the lack of traffic jams in the city.

The amount of cars driven on the road per day has risen to an astronomical number over the years. Although cars may be efficient they also have many harmful effects. Two of the worst are the effect they have on the enviroment and the mass traffic jams they cause. We as a society must recognize that by cutting down our usage of cars we can actually have a positive effect on our enviroment while also allowing ourselves the ability to bring traffic jams to a minimum.

Honestly I think its going to be a waste of time and honestly a waste of money lets just be honest! What type of school system is going to buy this ""technology"".

The world of technology changes everyday, It changes when you're not even thinking about it. We use technology everyday from phones,to cars, and so many more. This is taking technology to a whole other level, this computer can detect rather you're happy or sad, depressed,mad. The crazy part about this whole situation to me is it feels like you're being watched. In pararaph 6, second setence, it states this ""For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow.

I Also feel like this system isn't fit for schools, Especially if they are considering puttin this in an elemetry school. Maybe they should put this in a college/university, a hospital so that people can get inspirational quotes. So there are pros and cons about the whole technology, but for it to be at a school with MINORS I'm just going to have to pass and be against it. Some students just like me or even younger might completly disagree or agree about my argument. I mean it do have good things about it such as; detecting if you're happy or sad, but the con about that is how will a kid even understand exactly how they feel, yeah everyone knows how they feel and everyone know their own emotions, but to have a computer detect it for you? what since does that make. And to even furter it in my opinion it's putting psychologists, counselors, doctors out of business If this computer/technology can do ALL of this, than whats the point of wasting money to see a professional?

If every single person on the planet were to reduce the amount of driving they had to do, if they started driving hybrids, if they began using cars that ran on vegetable oil or electricity, we could practically erase the damage that has been done to our ecosystem via pollution. It would take a while but I don't see why we couldn't attempt to make Earth a little greener.

According to paragraph 41 in article four, a quote, stated ""A study last year found that driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...."" meaning that they had either carpooled or used a friendlier alternative to cars and the gaseous fumes they emit. If people were to start riding bicycles we could drastically change not only our planet and the ecosystem, but we could also fix our health.

Most American's rarely excercise and it's a common thing to be mildy obese to extremely and deadly overweight. We could easily begin a new generation of healthier teens and adults if we were to introduce healthy lifestyle habits whilst still at a young age.

Vauban, Germany has led a research team to see the impact that driving motor vehicles has on society. There are 5,500 people living in this ""rectangular square"" mile that ""may be the most advanced expirement in low-car suburban life"" if they could do it, why can't we?

0980c17,"Dear Senator,

While it is unfair, the Electoral College should still be used. There are some problems with the way it works, but it would still be easier than having presidential elections by popular vote.

One of the reasons why the Electoral College should still be used is the certainty of the outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible - it happened in 2000 - but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes - 538 - is an even number, but it is highly unlikely.

Secondly, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by the virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

At the most basic level, however, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

Aside from it being a little unfair, the Electoral College does its best to elect a President, which is why it should still be kept.    ",2
30b1d9b,"No one wants to wach ads but wouldnt they be more intresting if there was a way they could relate to us more. In the article ¨Making Mona Lisa Smile¨by Nick D´Alto he talks about a way that a coding system can read our emoitions.

In the text they talk about a program called Facial Action Coding System that will use our emotions to make our experience with technology better.

The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valiable because ads can be more personal, it can help keep students more intrested, and can make animated faces more expressive.

Ads are an example on how the Facial Action Coding System can be valuable. In the text it states ¨For example, if yoy smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be dirffent.¨ (D´Alto).

So if a student is doing somthing on a computer and an ad pops up for a math game and he dosnt like it the next ad could change to a math game that he does help.

The ads coud help the student find a game that can help him learn. Ads and keeping the student mare intrested are ways the Facial Action Coding System is valuble.

Keeping the students intrested is also another way the Facial Action Coding System can be benifical to a student. In the text it says ¨A classroom computer coud recognize when a student is becoming confused¨ (Dr. Huange).

If it could reconize that then it could modifiy the lession.

The lession would be better for a student and also it would be like having a teacher right next to you teaching you in the way you learn best.

Keeping the students intrested is anothe way the Facial Action Coding System can be valiuble but there is one more example.

The Facial Action Coding System can make animated faces more expressive.

The author states ¨ The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive¨ (D´Alto).

When taking an online corse if a animated faces could be more expressive it would make the student more involved.

Also it could make the student feel like they have some one to help right next to them.

This is how making animated faces more expressive can help students in a classroom.

This is how ads can be more personal, it can help keep students more intrested, and can make animated faces more expressive help support the claim that the use of emotinal reading technology can be valuable for a student.

By making things more personal.

Also by keeping the student intrested so they dont get side tracked. Finaly by keeping the student happy.

Wouldent you want a more presnal expericence when learning to help keep you intrested and more involved?    ",4
4e15bea,"Why do we keep this despised method of choosing the president when 60% of American citizens want a popular vote instead? This is an outdated method and viewed as anachronism by many. While some say that it creates a more stable outcome, it is a ""winner-take-all"" system where not everyones votes count. The election of the president should be based on popular vote because it is unfair that not everyones votes count, their is a chance of a tie breaking out, and the disaster factor because so much could go wrong. Although it seemed like a good idea at the time, it is unfair and irrational to all voters in the United States.

It is injustice that not everyones votes count under the Electoral College. The process of the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president, and the counting of votes by congress. Voters are directly related to this because the popular vote of a state usually gets the electoral vote of the state. This is good for the majority but what about the minority. The Electoral College is a winner-take-all system so their voice does not get heard. If a voter is democratic in Texas it would be a waste of time voting, because  most of texas is republican and the 38 votes would go twords a republican. If it was based on popular voting then the minority would get a say and could help.

One of the most worrying situations is the prospect of a tie in electoral votes. Because the Electoral College is made up of an even 538 electors, Their is the possiblilty of a tie. If that were to happen, then the electin would be thrown into the House of Representitives, where state delegations would vote on the president. This would be a problem because some states, such as Wyoming, would only get one or two votes but others, like California, would get more than thirty. Also, the House of Representitives would vote for the canidate they want, not reflecting the will of the people at all. If a tie seems unrealistic, just remember in 1968, 41,971 votes would have created a complicated mess.

Moreover, their is the disaster factor, Their are many problems and kinks in the system and some of these can destroy the system. The worst one we ever expiriednced is the recounts in Florida in 2000. The state legislature could always pick electors that will defy the people. In 1960, the Louisiana state legislature almost changed Democratice electors with ones that would vote againts John F. Kennedy. Also in 1960, Hawaii sent two states of electors to congress. Perhaps the worst is a party's canidate casting a vote for whomever they please, ignoring the people. This is one of the biggest downsides of the Electorial College.

The Electorial college is no longer usefull or democratic. If instead we vote the president on popular vote we won't expirience the unfairness to voters, the problems of a tie, or the disaster factor. It can help in some situations but for the most part is spurious at best. The Electorial College is outdated, unfair, and non- democratic and should be replaced by a popular vote.    ",5
8e9109b,"The role a car plays in the life of an individual has made changes through out the years. There never was a significant meaning to having a car; it just meant having a vehicle that can get you from point A to point B. As the human society continues to progress with the creations of technology, the use of cars has diminished greatly in different parts of the world. Not being able to use a car seems like there is no bright side, but there are actually many advantages on limiting car usage.

The United States always had this recognition of being one of the world's prime car cultures. ""The first Model T cars were born in the U.S. It has also been the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized 'Mustang Sally."" President Barack Obama identifies in the article,

The End of Car Culture, his dreams for the U.S ""to curb the United State's geen house gass emissions will get a forturious assist from an incipent shift in American behavior."" Going back to the article as reference, studies show ""americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by... as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak... there was also a drop in percent of 16- to 39- year olds getting a license."" The cause of the downfall in car usage can be pointed towards a few factors; internet making telecommuting possible, the renewal of center cities, and the rise of cellphones and car-pooling apps. It is not because society assumes cars are becoming of no use, the role of technological improvements are making things a lot easier than how things were in the 1960's. The United states has the option of using cars or not, in other places like Paris, the option to drive has become a choice made out of a person's own power.

Paris, France is a location that anyone dreams of visiting. The city is beautiful but the levels of smog have made it impossible for people to enjoy the views of the city. According to the article,

Paris bans driving due to smog , ""it has been enforced to the citizens of a partial driving ban in order to clear the air... people were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine which is $31 in the United States."" The way things are organized in Paris goes by a person's license plate number. In correlation to the article, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifiying smog."" However, not all of the cars used in Paris, France were banned. Those cars that are plug-ins, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers were allowed to roam the street of Paris. A good majority, 67 percent, of vehicles in France are made up of diesel, and that kind of fuel were the ones to blame since gasoline was not in favor in a city like that one. In the same way, places like Bogota, Colombia, had similar situations as the peolpe that live in France.

In the country of Colombia there has been a day dediated to doing things with no car; it's a car-free day. In contrast to how banning driving is in Paris, Bogota, Colombia has everyone participate in this 24 hour event. If a person were to violate the rule they are to face $25 fines. The article,

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, explains that ""millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during the car-free day."" Just like the goals in Paris, Colombia has goals to promote alternatice transportation and reduce smog. A businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza, explains ""it's  good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" No one would everythink that driving is as stressful as going to work. When put into mind, things begin to make sense. The early mornings of road rage people encounter makes their entire day a little more stressful than what it should be. Driving is a wonderful advantage but there is always more than just a car. Colombia's main goal, as expressed in the article ""is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.""

In the end of it all cars have always been in the making; trying to find new ways to improve and modernize. Although cars may have had significant meanings in the older times, as society continues to prosper in technological making, cars are beginning to be identified as material objects that are not as important. They are just in use for people to get from one place to the next when other things are not working.    ",5
89f8fab,"Dear state senator,

""It can be argued that the

Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying thier state-Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.... But of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about on-half the eligible American population did vote in [2012's] election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election....""-

""paragraph 23"" ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing the president""-by Richard A. Posner

If the president was elected by popular vote then the voting would truly be up to the people and not electoral votes given to each state. that puts a limit on it. If the president was choosen by a popular vote then it would be more of a demacratic society like we are expose to be. A Electoral college is not democratic at all the people aren't voting for the president directly and they dont even use the peoples votes in the count. If they do they count it less then they do when the state representitives elect the president. the only true way to see ""what the people want"" is by switching to only a popular vote: it is ran by the people, voted by the people, based by the people. haven't you ever heard the term "" Give the people what they want.""? Well what are we waiting for? It's time to change our voiting systems and fast before we hit a whole in the Electoral College. The constitution states ""We the People"", what happened to the people when it comes to voting, we get to vote but we aren't voting for the president (directly) like they have the U.S. citizens thinking. We are voting for someone to hopefully vote for our choice. My only question to you senator is, why hasn't the Electoral College been abolished yet? The people even know that their vote will have no effect right now, like it says in paragraph 23, source 3 ""knowing their vote will have no effect."" Last I checked the peoples vote is expose to have the whole effect... thank you for you time senator. I hope to see changes soon!!             ",3
eee709e,"People have said that driver less car is a good idea and I disagree.I am here to talk about all the bad thing and why we should not be using them for the future. First,

because they are only legal in certain state. Second, they are prone to malfunction while it is driving.Finally, the driver less cars can't performe complicated task.

My first reason why we should not have driver less car, is that it can cause a lot of problems in the states. First of all semi driver less cars are only legal in places. The cars is limited to those places also. It can cause problems for the states in a wreck because they would not know who to blame. Manufacters have said that the cars a improving on reliability, but we dont know how much it have improved.

Second, drivers car have malfunction all the time. These malfunction can cause accidents and money. In the story it said that people can get bored and forget that the car can't opperate in complicated situation. It wil also be hard to fix a malfunction car; which means it will cause you more money. Bmw have said they have tested the cars and the perfromed well, but the haven't studied them for a long period of time for more information.

Finally, Driver less cars may drive for a long time but the cant perform well when its in a complicated cituation. Studied have showed that these cars need to improve on it perfoment. The improvement are crucial because it makes the drivers safer, but these improvments are hard to make. If you have a driver in a car he would pick up on stuff quicker than the driverless cars.

In conclusion, we need cars that can to do complicated task, to do that you will need a person to drive. Second these cars are only legal in certai places. These places have laws that the cars should follow. We also need the driver les cars to improve. If we don't have these improvements then we will have problems.   ",4
812bb51,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that exploring and studying Venus must be done despite the dangers. They support this idea by stating how similar Venus is to Earth and that Venus could have been like Earth many years ago. They don't ignore the dangers though.

The author makes a point to mention the dangers of conducting research on Venus with statements like ""almost 97 percent carbon dioxide,"" and ""highly corrosive sulfuric acide in Venus's atmosphere."" They still combat this with reasons to continue though with statements about how similar it is to Earth, and that it ""could have supported various forms of life"".

Venus could have supported life forms and we might be able to research them if we were able to get to them. The author brings up computers that are entirely mechanical. these computers could be build to withstand the intense conditions of Venus.

Venus is referred to as Earth's ""twin"". Would you be willing to explore or send Items to explore Venus, so we can know more about it?

Its would be amazing if NASA could get samples of the rock, gas, and other things on Venus. The reason it would be amazing is so that we can know how Venus is just like our earth they call Venus Eath's ""twin"" so it would be amzaing if they had a lot more in common. NASA is willing to send people there but the only problem is that it is to hot there for people to go there and land there and take samples. The only way NASA said they could send people was if thyey could hover over Venus at about thirty miles or so, that is about how high a jet airplane fly. NASA would like to make things so that humans do not have to risk there lives to get samples so NASA is making some things in the articule it says this

""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplidied electronis made os silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulatiing to chaos of Venus's surface and hahve lasted for three weeks in such conditions""(7). Nasa finally thinks they have found somethng they could use that was made a lon time ago. it is called the mechanical computer the device was first envisioned in the 1800s and played a important role in the 1940s during WWII. the reason scientist believe they can use this is because the device makes calculations by using gears and leavers and do not need electronics at all, so they are saying systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

After all would you decide to help out and figure out more about Venus? Scientist are doing a great job so far with everything they are figuring out about what could be more helpful to them. They also know that is can be safe for them to hover over Venus instead of landing on it and having a horrible tragidy.

cfa17b8,"Driveless cars, doesn't that sound like a splendid idea? I mean, think about it, a car that will drive itself and take you basically anywhere you please to go. Now, I know you may be thinking, ""but don't we still have to do other things in order for this to work out and better technology?"" The thing is we've had the tech for it since the 1980's and have been developing it ever since. So, are you all about the driveless car as I am?

Driveless cars are more and more of a thing now a days and it's progressing, more car companies want to invest in it as well. The thing about them is that they still need more time to be able to perfect it or at least maintainable for drivers to have. They're putting in new technology so it can be able to drive smoothly and carefully 100% of the time and so all you have to do is look at the road and take over whenever you need to. In the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"", he mentions that now the car can drive itself and be good over 90%. 90% is a lot if you think about it, 90% of the time the car is driving smoothly and carefully and everything. You don't have to worry about a thing, it has all the sensors and everything to detect and near by cars or accidents so you can take over to drive around or avoid holes or something.

But there are some downsides to having driveless cars. For example, there could be a malifunction with the cars system or there could be a system over ride. You never know what could happen is any of these things were to accure, so you also have to be safe about autodrive, as I like to call it. If there were an accident to ever accure or happen there would be problems on who to pin the blame on, either the driver or the manufacture. They wouldn't be certain because it can either be driving itself or the human could've done the error. But, they're still working on improving it and making it more persist and steady.

In conclusion, are you with the whole, driveless cars yet, because I am Mainly because I like the idea of being able to be driven around and how they can take us to our destination without having to do anything besides look at the road. Even so, it isn't that hard of a task to take over and drive for a couple of minutes if a contruction is going on or an accident happens.",3
812f0ba,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author writes about the idea of exploring Venus. The author mentions many obstacles, that make the exploration of Venus hard, but he also talks about why it is important for us to explore the planet.

One of the most important reasons, to explore Venus, is the fact that Venus could once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. The author writes

""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". The author also brings out the fact, that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.

In Paragraph 8 the author writes about how exploring the planet would not just be for the information, but to feed the curiosity that humans naturally have. According to the authors opinion, if we can defeat the problem that is exploring Venus, we will be more confident and innovative facing equally intimidating endeavors in the future. The author expresses his opinion about exploring by saying

""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expnded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

So in Paragraph 4, when the author says ""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable"" he means that the insight we would gain and the satisfaction of feeding our curiosity makes Venus a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. I truly hope,that the challenge of exploring Venus will be defeated, because it could possibly change the way we see our World.   ",3

""Technology to read students"" knows when a student is bored. This is great because, if a student is bored during a lesson then you know the lesson isn't helping them. It will also help teacher out to pick a diffrent assignment or move on to something else. If the assignments are boring it looks bad on students and also the teacher, because nobody is getting work done. So technoly that reads students would help out big time.

If technology knows when you are mad, or frustrated the computer would know that and the computer would alert the teacher then, the teacher would know you were probably frustrated because you were struggling. Say a student was scared or nervous to ask the teacher for help, the teacher would get the alert from the computer saying the student is frustrated.

Last, technology will tell you if the student is happy. This will help because, if students are happy with an assignment that means they are getting it and they know what they're doing. The teacher will get an alert saying students are haptpy then that means they are enjoying the assignment or lesson. If everyone is happy it looks good on students and teachers.

The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions she was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating she was 100 percent happy, I mean she was being drawn which means she must have been one of the best looking women around or something was good about her and only her, and her face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around her that is causing her face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because she doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about her emotions are her lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims she is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that.

Having limited car usage can be great in some cases. It could really help the envirorment effectiviely, Provide less funds for people, and even challenge companies to pursue a bigger idea than just cars.

Our ecosystem is in dangered. All of the pollutio and waste that people put into the air needs to stop. The idea of having imited use of cars can provide a healthy and great looking earth. In the article by Robert Duffer ''Paris bans driving due to smog'' we see the understanding that paris can help support the idea for having limited usage of cars. ''After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city'' a sentence stated in the article. Paris typically has more smog than other european captials. ''Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (pm) per cubic meter comparied with 114 in brussles and 79.7 in london''. With nobody driving their cars for a day, they managed to clear up alot of smog and make the earth look healty again.

Having the idea for limiting car usage can also have a very big impacted on people financal funds. its common sense. Not having to pay for gas, car insurance, car payments, and even mechanical payments as well. And having not having to pay so much of those bills can provide person with a greater amount of cash in their pocket. But there can be a down side to not having a car also. Cars are made to get a person from one place to another and if there isnt any transportation how are you supposed to go to work or make some food stops. The solution is simple. Ride the bus, Walk, Bike, get some exercise for once, thats the biggest reason why america is  so lazy.

Car compaines such as Ford, Dodge, Toyota all compete with one another. But as the days go on by. Studies state that less and less people are buying cars. In the article ''The end of the car culture'' by Elisabeth Rosenthal states that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes on by. This has left researches pondering a fundamental question: Has america passes peak driving? My answer would simply be, No america has not passed peak driving, but how can you by a car and pay a buncg of bills with no money? Thats my question. People dream of cars everyday. Wishing they could drive a brand new converible Ferrari to school. But welcome to reality, were that really doesnt happen. And are economy does not help it one bit. ''at the Mobile Congress last uerar in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford motor company, Laid out a business paln.

Also, once they are fully developed, accidents resulting from texing and consumption of alcohol will be a thing of the past.

In 1980, speed sensors were put on the wheels of cars to create antilock brakes. Since then, they have been further developed to sense dangerous situations and react to them. They can apply brakes and reduce engine power in a much faster manner than any human could. As this technology develops, cars will become much safer and more capable of handling situations on their own.

Most car accidents are caused by human fault. People consume alcohol, use drugs, are distracted by their phones, eat, and sometimes simply don't pay attention. With driverless cars, these things wouldn't be an issue. When driverless cars become fully developed, people can endeavor in whatever mindless activity they choose and not hurt anyone on the road. Road rage will become less of a problem. Speeding will be a thing of the past as well as many other traffic violations.

The amount of pressure there is around 90 time bigger than our atmosphere pressure. It is even raining sulfuric acid their.

If would make a machine that will be able to stand the condintions of Venus, we will most likely understand those things better. Also NASA has an idea to where we would be able to send people there. It would be a blimp like vehicle that would hover above the surface and that would allow us in theory to withstand the ground conditions. But that is only the ground conditions, we would still have extreme heat. But instead of around 800 degrees, it would be around 170 degrees fahrenheit.

""The Challenges of Explooring Venus"" says ""Venus, something called the Evening Star, is one of the brightest points of lights in the night

sky. making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot"". The authoor explain it very carefully and in intersting way. The other thing that author did is he give us an evidens of what he is talking about and he explain it. Like""On the planet's surface, temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrebheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". This part was so important because it is telling about what is the degrees and the time.

So it's mean the author supports this ideas pretty good. He tell us about everything that we can think off. He explains everything that he says in the aritcle.",2
be4b299,"I disagree that this Facial Action Coding System is benefical for the classroom. There are many things about this that could go wrong. This type of tecnonly would not be valuable to our schools.

Although all of the facial recognition sounds good, there are some parts to it that could be bad. There are many things that could turn out to be negative. Here is a question to think about: Is he downgradeing teachers? In the sixth paragraph Dr. Huang of the Beackman Institute for Adveanced Science predicts, ""A classroom computer could recgonize when a student is becomeing confused or bored"", he continues with, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" I believe he is trying to say that teachers don't do enough so we have to bring in a computer instructor to make it less boring. This is not only bad for the students, but also the teachers.

This also can be a distraction in class. While the teacher is giving a lecture about an important skill that students need to learn, there are students in the back of the classroom trying to mess around with the facial coding system by trying different faces and causing a disruption. Kids are easily distracted and this is just another distraction from keeping kids engaged and focused on the studies that they will need for the rest of their life.

While a child is learning, for instance, a math program site, they could be trying to get in it but there are ads that pop up ,in paragrah 6 it states that ""if you smile when a Web ad apperars on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" If a child looks away from the computer at his/her friend to wait for he ad to be over that he/she doesn't want, and smiles while glancing down to the screen to see if the ad is over, the computer could take this as a happy signal for the ad. So then it will play another one that is similar to the ad that the child did not want.

So, no, I do not believe that this technology would be a very good tool to express in the classroom. I believe that there are lots of things that could go wrong, and not enough right. I don't think that this Coding System would be valuable to our schools. ",4
c983e08,"Fellow citizens of mine I have life changing news for you. The advantages of limiting car usage. What can possibly be good about that you ask? By limiting your car usage you will be saving the Earths atmosphere. Cars today emit alot of Carbonmonoxide into the air causing smog in some extreme ways. Paris, France is a great example of how bad cars can be when it comes to harming the atmosphere. The smog in Paris was so bad that the had to ban peple with even number licence plates that day, then odd the next day. The smog that was created by cars in Paris was rivialing Chinas capital city Beijing, also know as the worlds most poluted place. The weather made the smog worse in France but was eventualy lifted after a wile. After that the ban on the Cars was lifted.

This however could of been avoided if they limited the use on cars in their country. So knowing this, will you limit yourself?    ",2
d97863b,"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. The Facial Action Coding System can help the teacher, helps students bring a smile to their face, and helps people tell how other people are feeling. The technology will help a teacher understand how some students are feeling so the teacher can know what to do differently. It can put people in a better mood by just smiling. The technology can also help people see what kind of emotion other people are feeling.

The new technology called the Facial Action Coding System can help a teacher understand how their students are feeling. For example, if some students are bored, the teacher can try to do something more exciting. In paragraph 6 it states, ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This shows that a teacher would know if a student is confused and could explain to a student more to help them. This new technology helps both students and teachers.

The technology can help students bring a smile to their face. By just smiling even if you're in a bad mood, can make you feel better. The text says, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.""(paragraph 9) This means that moving your facial muscles can help you be in a better mood. It may help students smile more, which can make them feel better.

The Facial Coding System can help friends and family recognize each other feelings. Instead of wondering if someone is not in a good mood, the technology will tell you. In paragraph 5 it says, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" This explains that you can tell how someone is feeling by the look on their face, but the technology will help you know how they're really feeling. This can help a person cheer someone up if their depressed or sad.

The new Facial Action Coding System will be valuable in a classroom to help read the emotional expressions of students. It will help teachers understand how students are feeling, put a smile on people faces, and help people recognize how other people are feeling. This new technology can help many different people. ",3
954c8ac,"In "" The Challenge Of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers its presents. And today i will evaluate how well the author supports his idea.

The author has supported evidence for his idea, and alot of it. The author tells us about how not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades . Those that have did not surivive the landing for more than a few hours. The author also talks about the envoriment on venus. telling us about all the dangerous air and how hot it is. And includes erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

he also supports the claim that it is worth while to study by talk about how it was once just like earth. the author tells us, and i quote: "" long ago,Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like earth. Today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth"".

So there you have it. The author does a good job supporting making his claim and backing it up.",2
ddf1b14,"Many uncommon things happen causing people to be very fascinated with a certain subject. Any time something to do with space occurs, many people freak out or become fascinated with the subject. When something to do with space does occur, then usually people believe alien life forms. But with a cleaner and better camera the photos revealed that it was a natural landform and not an alien monument after all.

With an even better camera lense than before the picture is still proof that shows it is a normal, typical landform. Even with small objects you would still be able to clearly see if the object is a landform or a alien life form. The natural landform is equivalent to a butte or mesa. The ""face"" on Mars is still a like to a normal landform on Earth.

The form can not be life like or be alien like due to the amount of information and facts that NASA has to back up its ideas. The conspiracy theorists don't have as many facts as NASA to back up their information and ideas. NASA has majority of the information and facts which over rules the conspiracy theorists information and facts. ",2
a8e1e0f,"No, that is not a face in the picture from the Viking 1 from 1976,rather, like the scientists at NASA say, it is a natural landform.Yes, I know it looks like a face but in reality,

it's not.Technically, you really can't say it is from an alien life form because scientists and astronauts haven't found evidence of life on Mars yet.Conspiracy theorists say NASA is trying to hide the truth from us when actually they want you to know the truth.Otherwise, if they didn't want you to know the truth they wouldn't have put the picture out in the first place.There are a lot of statistics and facts that obviously point to the truth and I'm going to explain all of them to you.First,the other and newer pictures, the obvius comparison to landforms on Earth, and why your brain thinks it sees a face.

First of all, it's obvoiusly not a face because the newer pictures ,that were taken of the same thing show a different thing.You might wonder, how can it show a different thing but still be the same thing?Well, the newest picture,from 2001, was taken with a much better camera.So, the picture is clearer and so is the fact that this is a natural landform.Finally, the pictures are the most important clue that the face is a natural landform.That is how the pictures tell that the face is a landform.

Secondly, if you compare landforms on Earth to the face pictures you'll get similar pictures.For example, if you take a picture of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho from above and compare it to the 2001 picture they'll look identical.That is according to cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.He stated that, the face reminds him the most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.Finally, when and if you get the chance you should compare the face to other landforms on Earth.That is how comparing landforms on Earth,to the face can provide evidence to you that the face is a natural landform.

Lastly, your brain somewhat tricks you into seeing a face,but don't worry because it's natural.When you look at the first picture, you're most likely going to see a face, even I see a face.So, we kind of get excited about discovering another life form, and we start to jump to conclusions.Don't think there is something wrong with that because there is not, as long as you have evidence to support it,but in this case,you don't.Furthermore, the reason are brain 'tricks' us into seeing a face is in our DNA.For example,from when you were born everytime you looked in the mirror or looked at somebody else, you saw a face.The reason why you always see a face is because our brain has been ''hard-wired'' to recognize a face.That is how our brains trick us into seeing a face.

To conclude, those are all the clues/reasons why your brain sees and thinks the first picture is a face when it's actually a natural landform called a mesa.To recap, the comparison of the first picture to the 2001 picture can show that it's a mesa. Next, the comparison of landforms on Earth to the face can show you it's a mesa.Those are clues that can prove to you that the face is a mesa. So basically, all you have to do is compare different things to the face.Finally, the reason why your brain tricks you into seeing a face instead of a mesa is because everybody's brain has been 'hard-wired' to recognize a face.So that is why when you look at the first picture you see a face instead of what it really is, a mesa.Finally, sometimes all you have to do to find the truth is dig and look deeper and you'll discover the truth.That is why I say the face in the first picture is actually, indeed a mesa.",4

552ae9a,"The technology called Facial Action Coding System to identify human emotions should not be developed for a classroom environment. First of all, this software is still technology and can't always be accurate. There is also the problem where this technology would be too advanced and expensive to produce for most computers. Humans can also do a better job of telling emotions of others more than technology could.

The Facial Action Coding system cannot always be accurate. According to the article, humans make a variety of faces to show expressions everyday. The article explains this by saying, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly)."" This shows that human expressions are not always the same and can vary depending on the individual making it hard for technology to detect the exact facial expression. This serves as a big problem when it comes to how the technology could work.

Other people could usually tell how they are feeling more easily than a computer could. The article states that friends can usually tell how they are feeling by looking at their facial expressions. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" This shows that humans can usually tell how they are all feeling simply by looking at eachothers expressions. Others might argue that some people have a harder time seeing what their friends feel and that this software would help them undrestand better.

A computer has to look at millions of other peoples expressions and try to tell how they are feeling,while people can usually tell what individuals they see everyday are feeling.

The technology and money needed for installing this onto school computers would be way too expensive. The article even states this by saying that home computers would not be abke to handle the algorithms needed for this software. ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This quote shows that the average PC would not handle what is needed for the software to work. To get the computers needed, you would have to replace all the school computers with newer ones that could handle the capabilities.

What is needed to produce these has far more negatives than positives. For example, you would have to replace all computers with newer more advanced ones to help with the lack of computers that can handle this software. Further more teachers would not have to figure out what students are feeling by themselves making it harder for them when the software breaks down. Also the teachers could more easily tell what their students feel without the software as technology is not always accurate.      ",4
7bf3f8e,"In the Essay, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" , The author suports the claim that the knowledge and insight that could be gained from exploaring Venus outweighs it's risks, making it a worthy pursuit.

The author of the article admits that with todays current technology, it would be impossible to explore Venus. He lists facts that highlight Venus's inhabitability, such as "" No spacecraft has survived on venus for more than a few hours"", ""The atmosphere is almost 97% carbon dioxide"", and ""the clouds are of highly corrosive sulfuric acid"". The author presents these valid points and continues to list more before identifying any specific reward that outweighs them. No spacecraft has landed on venus in over 30 years, so why should we try again? The author reubtes these facts by indirectly claiming that we should attempt and expedition to venus because it is difficult. By overcoming a great and difficult task, we learn and advance more than by overcoming a simple and easy task.

Let it be noted, The author does not expect anybody flying to venus with shear willpower. He also presents ideas and advancments in reguards to how we might be able to fly to venus. In Paragraph 5, the author presents the idea of a blimp, floating 30 miles above the venusian atmosphere, Could be maintained and be used in the research of Venus. At this altittude, the author lists "" temperatures would only be a toasty 170 degrees Fahrenheit"" and ""Air pressure would be close to sea level on Earth"". However, the author does not cover the resources needed to produce a spacecraft of the scale.

Even if the author builds the fact that it is currently impossible to send a manned mission to Venus, The author does inspire interest in the topic. Through the description of several ideas that could be actualize into their desired goal, The author builds reason for belief of his topic.

The author ends his peice with the conclusion of ""Our Travels on Earth and beyonds should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and inovation"". This ending supports his arguement because it gives the argument that no matter what, knowledge will be gained and expanded from this challenging task. With knowledege being the reward, this makes the authors desire to Explore venus a very worthy persuit with consideration to it's dangers",5
f26a6a5,"The author supports this idea by giving reasons on why he thinks that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit.

He also gives resons on what the dangers of studying Venus will effect and why they would be dangerous.

In the article, it states that ""It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely"".

Another dangerous thing about studying Venus are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.

Thes conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth.

This explains that studying Venus can be very dangerous in a lot of different ways.

The author supports the difficulties and dangers of studying or traveling to Venus by stating that nobody has ever accomplished this for over three decades ago.

In other words, Venus is a very challenging planet for humans to study .

I know this because in the article, it states that ""Each previous mission was unmanned, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"".

This statement explains the fact on why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus for a very long time.

In addition, the author supports the suggestion that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit by exlaining that Venus has many features in it that are like features on earth.

In the article it states that long ago, Venus was probably covered with oceans and could've supported various forms of life.

Venus is the planet that is most closely to being like earth, which is why many people are fascinated by Venus and are eager to study and explore that planet so badly.

The reason on why people are eager to study Venus is because planets other than the earth, don'thave anything on it.

The only thing those planets probably have is dirt and an empty space throughout the whole planet, but what those planets don't have is bulidings or people or anything living on those planets.

However, Venus is a planet that may have had living features on it.

Which makes that planet very interesting to study.

Astronomers want to figure out the reason why Venus is the planet that is most closely related to the earth.

They want to have a soultion to this question and the only way to figure it out is by studying or travling to Venus.

Which can be a very worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

In conclusion, in my opinion I think the author did a very good job supporting his idea on Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

He supported his idea by including reasonings and explanations.

Also, he used examples and facts that supported his idea as to why he suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Another way he helped support his idea was by using pros and cons on his idea.  ",3
32cce18,"The new Facial Action Coding System cannot be very accurate due to humans being able to hide emotions quite easily. As it says in the beginning statement, ""improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others."" Thus meaning this software is not one-hundred perect reliable. Human beings can hide emotions without even trying. It is impossible to tell what someone is actually feeling.

In many movies actors act amd perform in different emotions everyday. Think about how an actor can use deception to trick the watcher into thinking they are upset and angry in the movie. Behind thr scenes the actor could be hystrically laughing but we dont see that, we only see the acting part. Therefor it is impossible for human beings to be able to detect someones true emotions, not even an advanced computer application can do so.

In paragraph 2 a statement catches the eye by saying, ""Hold on! Can we actually calculate emotionslike math homework?"" First off the human body is not a calculation, it is a living creature that has feelings and emotions. You dont just calculate the emotions to find them out. To find emotions you get emotionally attatched to someome or get close to them by talking to thrm amd they will vent to you and find out what is going on, either if thry are happy or sad.

In the writing it talks about Mona Lisa,and how she was feeling during that moment. Many may say you can do this and find out how she was feeling, but others will say it is impossible to find her emotions. Those others would also say to find her true emotions you would have to ask her, in which you can no longer do because she and the artist are deceased. No one will trully know how she felt durung this time, unless she states her feelings somewhere.

In paragraph 6 it states that,""Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad."" It later on states thag only looking into the webcam it could detect your emotions. Not only could it really not detect your emotions, it would make people feel unsafe because they are constantly being watched looking for a face to read. The Facial Action Coding System cannot read someones true emotions. The program may predict amd see what the individual is feeling, but it is trully impossible to tell what someone is actually feeling.",3
c5420b8,"Cars are a very important invention that helps people get from point A to point B. However, they are only good inventions at a limited use. Cars polute the air when everyone is using them in a city, and they also cause multpiple traffic jams and a great deal of stress to the users.

This was a very good move, ever since paris satarted limiting automobile use, Smog has gone down 60 percent. This is most definitely proof that cars polute the air. Paris even made it better for the people who did not have cars for the day, by offering free public transportation during the weekdays.

Germany has also made an effort to limit automobile use by starting a community that has almost zero cars. Cars are forbidden in Vauban, Germany. 70 percent of the people in this city do not own cars and rely on bikes, scooters, and public transportation to get them around. A woman from source 1 says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" this shows that people were not forced to be here for an experiment, it shows that life without cars, or at least a very limited ammount of them, can be very beneficial to not just the enviorment, but also the induvidual lives of the people that it is affecting. The city of Vauban has made an effort to be very dense and they have stores that are next to the residential area so citizens can walk there and not drive.

The citizens wwere so excited that on the third celebration of this habitat saving day, it was a very rainy and moist day but the people were still ready to clean the air so they biked, skated, and used public transportation in the rain. Neighboring cities even fancied the idea of this new idea, and decided to join the festivities and had there own ""no car day"". This change is growin more and more popular since it gives people a sense of communtiy and cleanliness when they are not spreading smog around everywhere, and even more people continue to join in on this revolutionary idea.

Cars were once ""the next big thing"" and now, they are getting old. This is statistically shown, according to Doug Short's analysis, that as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person dropped nine percent from wher ethe country was in 1995.

People think that ¨The Face¨ is created by aliens,but it is actually the Face is a natural landform. So here is how I´m going to support my claim with evidence from the article.

First of all,I claim that the ¨Face¨ is just a natural landform. According to the article the scientists used the camera´s absolute maximum resolution so if there were objects in the picture they would see it. The rock formation resembles a human head,eyes,nose,and mouth, so we understand why people think it was a face created by aliens.

Second of all,According to paragraph 12 ¨what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West¨(12).If it was created by aliens it would not be hard to find because there would be more then just one.¨That´s a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars¨(12).

In conclusion,I think that the Face is a natural landform. There are evidence from the article to support my claims.¨Malin´s team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera´s absolute maximum resolution¨(10).¨If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they were¨(11)!",3
f87ab51,"We should keep the Electoral College for the voting of the United States. One good reason is they know for sure who is going to the president of the United States because of the way the Electoral College is. This voting process helps avoid a lot of bad things too. There are so many good reasons why we should keep this form of voting.

Avoiding Run-Off Elections is one good reason why we should keep the Electoral College according to ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President."" It states that, ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes."" This is good because they keep one of the presidents that got the majority of the votes to win automatically,instead they have to do some math to see who the winner is."" In the first writing ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register. This writing says that ""Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" This is basically saying that everyone gets to go the presidential election.

Some more key points are some more notes in the first and last writing. In the writing ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President."" and it states, ""The Electotoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" This is saying that go by a different rule of voting because of the population being than other states. Another good point is in the first paragraph again and it says ""The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November."" This is good that you have a schedual for for the next voting this gives us enough time to vote, it also gives the time to see if the president is good or not.

There is some downsides to this little thing you have going on here though. That is in the second paragraph and it really gets my attention, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" With this in mind it is telling us the people that we are not voting for the president at all that is what most people believe that they are doing so you are kind of lying to some of them.

To wrap things up I am telling you that your Electoral College system is great in most ways. You should try and change some of those things that are bad about it though. Not just the one I talked about but more that others talk about and doing this can you and all that work with ten times better than you were before.

120cb91,"I believe that the negative aspects of driverless cars outweigh the positive ones. There are too many complications and problems that are yet to be solved. Driverless cars are a very unique and interesting invention, but I am not in favor of the development of these cars. There is a vast number of improvements that still need to be made in order for these cars to function properly.

Driverless cars have too much technology involved that could easily malfunction and lead to several mishaps. Looking at paragraph 4 it states that,""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" From this quote, you can already see how complex a driverless car needs to be in order to run efficiently. All of these gadgets have to installed and all of them are very necessary. According to the author in paragraph 4, it also claims, ""The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" If the LIDAR malfunctions, then the car has no information on its surroundings. It would be virtually impossible for a driverless car to work without the perfect execution of all these devices. I believe that there is too much room for error.

I also am against driverless cars because there is a lack of safety when a driver is not in control of a car. Many states agree with this and do not allow for driverless cars to occupy their roads. In paragraph 9 it explains how,""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" This quote tells you that the traffic laws of numerous states would need to be altered for driverless cars to be allowed. The majority of states believe that they are not safe and restrict their use. Traffic laws as well as liability laws would need to be redone in order to cover the safety. At the end of paragraph 9 it asks,""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver of the manufacturer?"" This directly correlates to a lack of safety and major complications. In case of an accident, the victim would not know who to blame and in the end would severely suffer. There are way too much obstacles that obstruct the safety of too many citizens with driverless cars.

Lastly, driverless cars are not fully capable of running independently. With this, you would need to figure out an effective way to alert your driver when their assistance is needed. If the driver could not be alerted, then this could lead to massive consequences. In paragraph 7 it states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This quote highlights the neccesity of getting the driver's attention. If in any case the driver was not able to be alerted, the repercussions would be severe.

In my opinion, driverless cars do not need to be developed. The science and technology involved is susceptible to malfunction and could result in many problems. There is a lack of safety when it comes to these cars and various states agree. Also, a driver could be clueless and not listen to the alerts given be the car when it was trying to gain their attention. This could lead to an accident or something even worse. For these reasons, I oppose the development of driverless cars. ",5
32e5a0a,"Should our way of voting in the United States be changed? The way we vote today is through the electoral college. Each president get a certain number of electoral votes and that is how we vote on specific leaders. The Electoral College process was established in our Constitution as a compromise. This way we could elect our president by a vote in Congress and election of our president by citizens who qualify. Is it not time for a change in the Electoral College?

First off, the Electoral College is a specified process. This process consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is manditory to elect the President. The way this works is every state has a certain number of electoral votes, mostly due to population. For example, a larger state with a large population will have more electoral votes than a smaller state. Also, each candidate running for president in your state has their own group of elector. These electors are chosen based opon the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. There is a presidential electon held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of the month of November. When you vote, you are helping choose your state's electors. When you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candiate's elecotrs. After your presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" showing all the candidates who ran for President in your state and with the names of their respective electors. This also shows which electors will be representing your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.

In addition, the pocess of the Electoral College should be changed. The are even a number of Presidents that tried to abolish the Electoral College. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, adn the AFL-CIO all agreed on abolishing it. It is proven that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Most voters today are significantly uninformed. Some do not even know what or whom they are voting for. Some of these people are not even U.S. citizens. Yes, some states do require to so identification, although others do not. A direct election would be more specified and easier for people to choose and use. Some people overlook these detail while others enjoy the system because of the power it provides them. There are multiple errors in the voting process. There are certain people that do not even posess a high school degree, let alone a college degree, that vote just because they want to. The is a massive suply of ignorance and pride that fall into play with the Electoral College.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president they choose, but for a slate of electors, who in turn, elect the president. For instance, if you wanted to vote for a specific person you would vote for a slate of electors pledged to that person. This method of voting is curupt and should be abolished. The people in American should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the largest election crisis in a century; the system could have lead to much worse than that. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for choosing electors, adn that those electors could alwyas defy the will of the people.

In conclusion, why is the Electoral college unhealthy? This system of voting is outdated and has many flaws throughout its system. Without this system being changed is could have a tremendous affect in the future of the United States. This irrational system lacks a basis in reality. The arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It is difficult to say but the Electoral College in general was a mistake.                    ",3

Luke had been working two part time jobs and his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He didn't say no because it was an opportunity of his lifetime. The program was to give countries supplies to recover food. The UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)employed seagoing cowboys totake careof horses, young cows,and mules.

Luke and Don(his friend) had went to New Orleans to get their seaman's papers then went to Greecewith a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. luke turned 18 before he got to Greece and was able to be drafted for the millitary. When he got drafted an dfound out what he was doing they told to keep doing that for his service.

Some reasons you should join this program is for one you get to travle. Another reason why is you can help poeple when they need it most. Luke claims it is a once and a lifetime thing that you don't get a chance to do a lot. Lastly it taeches you to take care of animals properly.

In conclusion you should join this group because you get to go around the world. Have great big adventures, and just have fun while taking care of things. If you are thinking about joining this program tell your friends to join it with you. When you are thinking about joining this program just think of all the places you'll go.",2

If the car is supposed to alert the drive what happens if it fails to do so in enough time to stop the crash? If it is driverless your kids could start the car and leave they wouldnt need to even touch the wheel. Driverless cars are a great idea but the dangers and other factors have not been depated yet.

Just think it drives itself, your daughter wants to go somewhere and you wont take her. She could turn the car on and set a destination anywhere and the car would take her there. You lost your car to an eight year old who couldnt reach the pedals. Now if the car had to be driven by a person she wouldnt have been able to leave. Also if your sick and dizzy and you need to go to the hospital your car could take you there. If someone is injured and you have to help them while the car is moving thats another advantage.

Your on a trip to california from indiana and your afraid to fly so you drive with the new driverless car. You get bored because you dont have to do anything,and your getting tired. So you fall asleep in the car; up ahead there is a broken bridge and your car couldnt wake you up and you missed the detour because your car was incapable of doing its job. Fortunatly your car has a sensor to that aplies the brakes when the driver does not wake up and take the wheel.

A teenager who DOES NOT know how to drive is supposed to steal a car for a gang as an initiation. He knows what the new driverless car looks like. Its the new car you just bout for 30 Thousand dollors. He brakes into the car and turns it on and sets the destination for the gangs warehouse. It drives itself there. He wouldnt have gotten the car there if it didnt drive itself.

What if the car doesnt stop at the lights and it causes an accident? Three people are injured two end up dieing. It could have been prevented if the driver of the driverless car was paying attention to the road. With the driverless car how many people do you really think will still pay attention to the road. This is a waste of taxe and government money. If we are going to use our money on something it should be to make gas cheaper, help veterans who are homeless, the wounded warriors who give us the freedom to spend money.

3c65b42,"The ""Face on Mars"" was not created by aliens. NASA has literal proof of the Face. It may be on pictures, but the things they put in movies and magazines isn't real. They use that to get attention, but they didnt actually go into space and get the pictures. NASA took time to build those space technologies that are made to go into space and look for things like that.

Hollywood movies and fiction magazines aren't true about the ""Face on Mars."" They say the ""Face on Mars"" was made by natural land forming. That is true. On Earth we have rocks formed naturally, or fossils were made using the imprint of dead animals and plants, but still formed naturally over time.

Do not believe what movies and sometimes even the internet says. Who you should really believe is the people who actually saw the ""Face on Mars"" with the technology they have built to study it. You should listen to the team of scientist who know all about space and the planets. They study the galaxy inside and out and know way more about the ""Face on Mars"" and the planets then the movies and magazines do. ",2

Driverless car will prevent many accidents due to people mistake. Which are normal we make mistakes, But with the vechile watching our steps or even driving for us would be a benfit for that driver.

Google states ""google cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash"". The cars aren't compeletly driverless; they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? your probably asking, although, the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires such as navigating through work zones and around accidents, until then they are free to text with a cell phone, call someone withour stoping. In this way, the driverless car is actually a safety feature.

How the car does this is with position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor.

But the most important piece is the LIDAR(spinning sensor on the roof), it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings. The combination of all is necessary for the driverless car to replicate the skill of a person at the wheel.

Even when the car require the driver aid, displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over. GM has developed drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays.

Over all I see benfit in having driverless cars, They driverless cars allow us to complete as task such as putting on make up or text messaging someone, but they can still allow us to take over if needed. Which means that we do not put our live compeletly in the mercy of ours cars, but rather allow the car and the driver to work as together.",2
fc9aa78,"The president of the united states is one of the most powerful political leaders in the world and controls the faith of one of the wealthiest countrys on the planet. There have been many discussions on how to elect the president of such a great nation. The Electoral College,  the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. If its worked for over 200 years why change it. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome and avoids run-off elections and should be kept as the form of election of the U.S. president of our state.

To Begin With, the Electoral College has been used for more than 200 years and our state is fighting for another 200 years of electoral college. In an article by Richard A. Posner called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President"" he states ""there are...reasons for retainig the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.""  Amongst these reasons one of them is the certainty of outcome and in source 3 paragraph 18 it states that ""A dispue over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reasons is that the winning candidates share of the popular vote."" Richard Posner is stating that Electoral College is more effective because it causes less trouble and does not need to be disputed unlike popular vote which needs to be disputed because the winning candidiates share of the Electoral college invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote.

Furthermore, The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. In an article by Richard A. Posner called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President"" he says ""nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370). There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invaribly produces a clear winner.""

c803055,"The electorial college should be thrown out and the popular vote for the president should take its place because the elctorial college is unfair and the people don't really have a voice.

The electorial college should go away because it unfair. Electorial votes are unfair because the canidates only focus on the bigger states, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campain ad."" Votes dont even get to vote for the president, they vote for state electors. ""Under the electorial system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This is why we should despose of the electorial system and just go off popular votes.

Another reason why we should replace the electoral college for popular vote is because the people don't really have a voice in the electorial system. Voters do not directly vote for the president but they vote for the slate electors who then vote for the president. We the people should have a direct vote for the president. ""Consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" so in other words we have put our trust in people to have a voice for us when we could just do it ourselves. ""voters sometimes get confused about electors and vote for the wrong candidate."" Even though the electorial system is all kinds of messed up there is an upside to it, ""perhaps most of the worrying is the prospect of a tie in the election vote. In that cases, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president."" They use the Representatives to break a tie so there wouldnt have to be a run-off election. With popular vote you wouldn't have to have a run off because there is not an even number of people registered to vote in America. So i urge the popular vote to take the place of the electorial college system.

In conclusion, the electorial college system should be exicuted and popular votes should be subsituted because the electorial college system is unfair and the people don't really have a voice in the election.    ",4
b362cc5,"Alien Life! A very controversial topic, some might say, especially at this point in time.

Some people believe that the face that has been photographed on Mars is evidence of alien life; however, it is just a landform because if NASA wanted to hide the existence of aliens they wouldn't have released this image in the first place, there were no other ""alien artifacts"" near the face in any of the images, and if the face was in fact an alien artifact, NASA would use this to its advantage because they would receive more funding to find alien life since there would be proof that alien life actually exists. Obviously, the face on Mars is not an alien artifact but only a natural landform made on the surface of the Red Planet.

One of the most blatantly obvious reasons why this face could not be made by aliens is because NASA does not believe that it is. Now, every one is entitled to their own opinions, but because NASA is saying that this face is not an alien artifact you should think that same thing. There would be no reason for NASA to want to release an image that possibly supports that there could be alien life on Mars and then just say that it provides no evidence for life on Mars, if NASA actually believed there really was life on the Red Planet. Either, NASA would have not released the image at all in an effort to prevent people from thinking that aliens could be living on Mars, or they would release their image and say the truth. In this case NASA released the image and then said that it does not support alien life on Mars, so it is very clear that the landform is just a landform and not an alien artifact.

Also, there were no other ""alien artifacts"" near the face. If this really was an alien artifact, there would be evidence left behind of the people that built this face, but there was not. And, the more recent pictures of the face were very high resolution, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters."" That may seem like a very large area for one pixel, but unless these aliens that live on Mars all live in one home that is less than twenty-five square meters, there is no one near this face that could've built it. Clearly, this landform could not have been made by anyone living on Mars because there simply is no one that is living close enough to this face to build it.

And last but not least, if this face on Mars was indeed an alien artifact, NASA would use this scenario to its advantage by blowing up the media with news of alien life in an attempt to gain more funding for the space program. There is absolutely no reason for NASA to try to keep the discovery of alien life a secret because, if anything, NASA would gain substantially from a discovery on that scale, so if the scientists at NASA think that this face is just a landform made on the surface of Mars, there is very little reason for someone to doubt them on this.

Now, some people may say, ""But wait! That face is clear evidence of alien life, and there is no way that a face like that could have naturally formed on Mars!"" If anyone is thinking that same thing, I can see why you may think that, but there is simply no scientific evidence to support your opinion. Yes, it is unlikely for a rock to form in the exact way to make it look like a human, but no, it is not impossible. Additionally, if that face was in fact a natural formation then there is no more evidence for it to support alien life than any other rock on Mars. Obviously, this landform was not made by aliens.

As anyone can see, the face on Mars is just a natural landform because NASA wouldn't release images propagating alien life if they didn't want to say that alien life has been discovered, there is no other evidence supporting aliens on Mars other than the face, and there would be no reason for NASA to try to cover this up because NASA would end up gaining in a situation where alien life was discovered.

Obviously this face is not an alien artifact; however, I believe that alien life does, in fact, exist, and that we may find it in the very near future, so look forward to what may come next.",6

The first sentence of the first paragraph the author states ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Since the author begins this article with the percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions, we know that this is going to be about reading someones emotions, not only Mona Lisa's.

Further into the article we read about this technology being in computers and recognizing facial expressions. To have a computer be able to even calculate ones expression, the computer must construct a 3-D model of the face electronically. Imagine sitting infront of your own computer while having it read what you're feeling! This advanced technology is more than what we think. The technology actually improves lessons in school, based on an individuals expression.

To have this technology in a classroom, it would be highly beneficial to students and even teachers. The benefits a student would be receiving are improved grades, lesson plans that are interesting, being more focused, and having more benefits with learning than what a teacher could give. Improving grades can be hard and that could very well be because a student is just not able to pay attention to the lesson due to how boring or confusing it may be. In the article the author says ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Using this to help determine a better lesson plan for the student is great because it will make them more focused along with being interested in their learning plan. This can lead to the student knowing what they are doing on their homeowork which also leads to better grades.

Some may disagree with the opionion of having this technology used in classrooms. Others may say that no matter the lesson, the student could just simply be tired or un-interested in learning. If a student is either of those, they could very well not have a benefit to this technology. However, it is more likely that a bigger percentage of students woud have a positive outcome while having this advanced technology in the classrooms.

Those who believe that this computer technology is not valued in classrooms could think that the software might not work effectivley. When saying this, I am saying that those people may think that the technology won't really read a students expression correctly. The creators of the software could possibly not have all of this technology figured out 100 percent. Although that could be the case, we should focus on whether the students believe they are being benefitted while using it.

There will always be one opinion or the other. However, reading this article makes me believe that having this technology in classrooms would be highly beneficial to students. Getting good grades is a big part of actually being able to enjoy or understand your lesson. While having better lessons, you will most likely have better grades. Teachers possibly can not benefit the students in the way this new technology could with lesson plans and maybe more. That is why most people should believe that having the expression reading computer technology in classrooms is good for the students in more ways than one. ",5
572e210,"The Facial Action Coding System is a system that enables computers to identify the human emotions.

If you're mad your orbicularis oris tightens your lips to show anger, your muscles on your face shows the computer what you're feeling. Dr.Huand new system can even identify mixed emotions because each expression is compared against a neutral face.

Bad things happen all the time, an dmost of the time they are accidents. I'm not sure I'd risk my life on something I'm not in control of.

Let's start off with the pros, because there definitely are some. Elderly people, or even extremely young people. May find it difficult to get places that they need to go. With the help of a driverless vehicle, grandpa would never miss another doctors appointment. That is, until his driverless vehicle that you so carlessly persuaded him to purchase puts him in a coma. People that are afraid to drive or physically cannot, they could really use a driverless vehicle to help them get place to place. Now, let's get down to the cold hard facts.

Technology, it screws up all the time. Millions of people have troubles with their cell phones, game systems, and cars (yes, even regular vehicles malfunction) every single day. If some manufacturers can not even get a regular everyday car to work correctly without shutting down, blowing up, or getting unalined, how are we to trust that a driverless vehicle will suddenly keep us safe. Sure, drunk drivers would be less of a problem, but how can you trust a drunk man to properly operate a driverless car? You can't. Anywhere that there seems to be a pro for these cars, there's a con not far behind.

Raging drunk idiot get in his driverless car. He decides he wants it to go full speed ahead at the man crossing the street. It's too easy to use these cars as weapons and call it a malfunction. There would be more cases of vehicular manslaughter than ever before. I don't know about you, but I like my life without driverless cars. They're too hazardous.

I don't want to live in a world where cars aren't things you drive. I like my life. I like knowing that most of the people on the roads know what they're doing. Technology has failed us again and again. I don't trust that it wouldn't do it this time around.      ",3

In the year 2000 there was a presidental election. The two canadate runnning were Bush and Gore. In that election there was a problem, Gore had won the votes of the people but Bush had won the votes of the the Electoral votes. Now the question is asked who should win, should the person who had the most votes from the people win or the person who had the most votes from the Electoral College win? This is something that has been going on for a long time, does the Electoral College over rule the people? This is an importain question that we the people should be asking, do we realy pick the persendent or does the Electoral College pick it and we are just there for show? The Electoral College is an out dated sistem that we keep because the goverment wants there to be a clear winner, but we know that is not what the people the people want the right to dicide.

The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers and made as a ""compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualifies citizens."" The Electoral College vote on the President and the Vice President. It has 538 members and for there to be a winner a canadate, has to get a majority of 270 electoral votes. Your states allotment of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional degation. The problem here is that there is 300 million people in this contery and only 538 people get to vote on who is going to be president.

Also most states have a Winner takes all system were the winner of the majority gets all of the votes. For example florida has 29 electoral votes so if one canadate get 15 which is the magority he will get all 29. Because of this there is not an acurate repisentaion of what the state thinks.

The last reason it is not a good system is because the people's votes do not matter. In the 2000 election Gore had won the peoples votes and Bush had on the Eletoral votes. now Bush became president even tho Gore had won with the people. The biggest problem with the Electoral College is the fact that it over rules the people. If the Eletoral College wins it does not matter how many people vote for the other person running it will not matter.

Yes, there maybe danger but that shouldn't stop us from inventing something that we could possibly fly to see how it could be if we sent life to another plant. It's so much like Earth because the plant has surface of rockysediments and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

The National Aerunautics and Space Administrations (NASA) is thinking about sending humans to study Venus. ""Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" They said imagine if we could fly our jet airplanes at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, then a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" Nasa is also working on toher approaches such as some simplified electronics made of silicon cardide to have tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and are having it to last about three wekks to see how the conditions would be.

They also said that there is another project such as looking back to old technology called (mechanical computers.)"" If they were used in WWII then why shouldn't we be able to use them now?"" they say. The thought of having them here is still a shock but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Having to use a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat is capable of melting the tin. But in comparison, using the mechancial parts can be made more resisant to pressure, heat, and other stronger forces.

Wanting to study Venus has value but not only because of the gain on the plant itseld but also because us humans are curious and would like to travel and see how life would be. Our travles to Venus are expanded to Imagation and Curiosity.",3

Peolpe where misstaking that Venus is a star. Venus it's a own plant. In the text says ""Venus is the second plant from our sun."" In phragraph one. Reserchers study Venus becouse backthen is was closer to earth. Dispise of Venus bing dangers. Reserchers what to fide out if it still hase some earth fechers.

NASA whats to get information about Venus. One of the idea of NASA is to seand peolpe to Venus. People will hover throw space. In the text says""our jet airplanes travel at higher altitude to fly over may storms.""In phragraph five. Flying aroud Venus is not placent. Dispice that Venuse is very hot,bing above is about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The air pressure is lower like the sea leveal. Resiving infromation in venus is limited becouse of how much lights it gives. We can not take anying from mars frome a distance. NASA have not founed a way to get far in to Venus. With this problem NASA takes it risky or as a challeng.

Anuther way to resive infromation is by sending elatronics to Venus. NASA had sent mutuple objets to mars. The objet semes to only servive fore some few three weeks. In oder to make somthing beter to sent in Venus is lookng at obld technology. Looking at phragraph siven it tells us that ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers."". NASA uesd newer technology but it has not over three weeks. Sending mechens that are made with meatel it will mealt or over heat because of the heat in Venus. With the old mechens and with the newer we will fined a more resestent salustion that can healp us with information.

One day we will have the limets to go in Venus. NASA has not gavie up Venus. Venus is valuble to us not olny because it's just a nuther resuers but because it will let us have the lemits to explore other plants. I do balive that we should know other plants.

c3ca4c2,"The author is this article, ""The Chanllenge of Exploring Venus"", did a very great job to support his claim that ""studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" The suthor starts off with explaining how its our ""twin"" and how we couldn't touch down on it for decades. Second, he starts to write about Venus's weather conditions. Then the author talks about how scientists want invest more into to studying Venus. Finally, he talks about how we should'nt give on discovering just becasue danger lies ahead. I will be sighting the details from the text to show how the author is supporting his claim or idea.

The author exaplains that it's our closest planet to Earth and it's right terms like density and size; meaning that the author is telling us the similarties between Earth and Venus. The text states ""Oftern referred to as Earth's ""twin"", venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" The author then talks about how Venus has note been touched in decades, which of course is very intresting matter due to the fact ist our closest planet. the text states ""Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" Well due to the harsh weather conditions of course no one has been there.

The author explains the weather conditions because he wants the readers to know why NASA doesn't have so much information about Venus. The text states that ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" Meaning thats basically impossible to get any information on Venus. The article also states ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" The author also writes about the temperture and weather more into detail. This is the author supporting detail about the danger Venus presents. Even though the very hostile conditions scientist still want to pursuit it.

NASA has a particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. The article stats that since they can't go to the surface they would have hover over the fray. The author is supporting or giving exaplains on how scientist are finding ways to pursuit Venus without going to the surface. The text also states ""Many reserches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This also supports how the author is giving details of pursuing Venus even though it's very dangerous. Venus could've been a better surviable planet than Earth.

The author explains that we should'nt stop just becasue we have a few problems to reach Venus. The author states ""...becasue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Meaning that humans are curious and will discover or find a way o discover things no matter what. The text also states ""Ours travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts"" Meaning that we should'nt stop because of all the dangers. That we should ""meet the very edges of imagination and innocation.

In conclusion, this is how the author did he a very good job on supporting his claim. he started off with explaing how its our ""twin"". Second, by explaning the weather conditions. Then by how NASA are finding solutions to get closer to Venus's surface. Finally by explaing how we should'nt stop discovering anything just becasue of the dangers of it.  ",4

dde645e,"Dear Marco Rubio and etc., I think that we should not keep the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the sake of the people. With the Electoral College, your voice isn't really heard. Votes should be counted individually and America will get the president that they really want.

For starters, there was a situation back in 2000 where Al Gore won the popular vote but didn't become president. That my friend, is unfair. The Electoral College doesn't really prove who actually won. Although, the incident happens back in 1880, I don't think it should happen again. Most of America wouldn't really think of the president as the president. I must admit, the Electoral College is a quick way to send in the votes on election day but it isn't efficient.

Like stated in paragraph 10, voters don't vote for the president, but for the state of electors. The electors are basically anyone who isn't holding office. State conventions, state party's central and presidential candidates can pick the electors. Votes can't always control whom their electors vote for which why you should get rid of the Electoral College. Plus it's a dumb name.

Another reason why is because the people of this country will be pissed if another Gore vs Bush situation happens again. Electors are really in control, therefor if they dislike who's running against their political party they have a shot at voting for whomever they want. That's unjust, and frankly unfair. Especially if a huge state is at risk.

One counterclaim might be that the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves the majority of votes cast.

I don't want to vote and wonder if my voice will be heard. I want it to be guarunteed because that's what the United States is all about. It's all about us being able to choose the president. The Electoral College is unjust and is a waste of time. If you guys decide decide on letting us elect the president by popular vote, more young adults will start voting and we'll know out voices are heard.    ",4
75353f0,"Although many see driverless cars as an alternative to cars with drivers. I do not see this as an alternative for the future. The driverless cars are not making split second decisions that a car with a drive can. ""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pullin in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" This is a small set back, and also another reason why I do not believe in driverless cars.

Changing roads completely would be very expensive. How long exactly would changing the road systems actually take? ""These smart-road systems worked suprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.""

All the technology in cars, yet humans are still needed, making calculated decisions instead of the car. ""The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.""

e0d4e7e,"Dear senator,

I am not in favor of the electoral college. The electoral college may seem helpful in some ways in terms of voting, but not entirely. Think of it this way; you vote for a specific candidate, but you are voting without knowing entirely whether or not your votes are making a difference because you have no control over who the electors vote for. I believe this system should make modifications.

Our county has already had many problems, and accusations of having a corrupt government. Hearing about the electoral college system, and the fact that as a nation we have almost no power for who is elected, does not help the case of being called ""corrupt"" or ""incorrect"". The people as a whole in the United States should be able to vote for the candidate of their choice, without worries. People who specifically vote for someone running for president should either be able to do it themselves, without having to vote for a slate of electors, or, the slate of electors should be more reliable. As in paragraph ten, we cannot always control who the elecotrs cast their vote for. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" Either the electors need to be more reliable in carrying out the requests made by the people of the United States, or we must make modifications to possible change or all together cease use of the electoral college system.

In addition to the fact the American people do not hace full control over who our electors vote for, we do not even have control over who our electors are.

In paragraph eleven, it states that ""legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" If you were truly in favor of protecting the rights given to the people of this country, you would notice this system is wrong. No control over our votes, and no control over the electors? Something must change.

Take into consideration how our country is affected every time a new president is elected. Sometimes this effect is good, others not so much. The popular vote should be able to decide who is elected for president because those who are voting will be effected greatly by the change in presidency. Popular vote means the vote cast the most, the vote submitted most, the vote a large majority presented. The popular vote is always at risk of being defied, and there is nothing the common people of the United States can do about it. There is no action we can take to change the election. In paragraph 16 of the article, it states that ""Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)..."" Yes this trust may rarely be betrayed, but it is entirely possible. Just because it does not happen often, does not mean it is impossible...and who knows? What if the trust is betrayed sometimes without our knowledge?

Finally, unless I have not made it entirely clear, I am not in favor of the electoral college system. Trust can always be betrayed, even if it does not happen often it can still happen without our knowledge. The people residing in the United States and under the laws of our country do not have full control on who is elected as president. I am, however in favor of election by popular vote. This means that a state casts its vote based on who the majority has voted for, and I truly believe this would system would best suit our country.                       ",5
2584fcb,"Hello, my name is Luke Bomberger, and I am a Seagoing Cowboy. The Seagoing Cowboys took care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped across the ocean. My friend, Don, and I signed up. I think you should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program, because you could save a life.

The Seagoing Cowboys help people in need, especially after World War ll, it feels so nice to help people in need, if you sign up you could feel it, too. Since we ship animals and take care of them around the world, we provide people with good livestock, that maybe, could save a life! And, if you're bored, the animals keep you busy. Also, there is some incredible sightseeing around the world.

Another reason you would want to sign for the Seagoing Cowboys program is you could see some truly, incredible things! Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China! I saw some beautiful things like, the Acropolis in Greece, taking the gondola ride in Italy, that has streets of water, I toured an excavated castle in Crete, and I loved the Panama Canal when I was on my way to China. That may be beautiful, but if you still aren't convinced, the danger that it puts in your life makes your heart pump!

My third reason, is the danger and heart-skipping-a-beat experiences that this program gives you! If you're bored with your life, think about the Seagoing Cowboys program. The reason I say this, is one rainy night, after I made my hourly report to my captain, I suddenly slid down a slippery ladder on my back. I would've fell off, if it wasn't for a strip of metal that caught me! I would have been in the deep water of the Atlantic by now. I felt happy to be alive, and I will never forget that moment.

My last reason is that I had so much fun, and it was a truly amazing, never-forgetting experience. On return trips we played games in the hold where the animals were. We played baseball, volleyball, and other games like table-tennis, fencing, boxing, and more, that got us ready for our next adventure. This program gave me a better-than-amazing experience, and I would love to share it with you!

Now, I should conclude my thoughts. You should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys so you could help people in need, see amazing things, such as the Acropolis in Greece, so you can have a dangerous but amazing life, and so you can have fun and have a never forgetting experience. Sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys, now!

Thanks,

62b0697,"I think they should develop the driverless cars, because it would be something new and most likely be safer then normal driving. People say the car could malfunction or go out of control but if they think that then why are there self drive airplanes. (auto pilot). Planes would make a even bigger accident if it were to malfunction. So I think driverless cars should have a chance. If the something happens to the car then it is the drivers fault, because he/she should have been paying attention and making sure nothing is going wrong.

It wouldn't be the manufacturers fault because they just develop it and make sure everything is in order, they don't have control over once a customer buys a uses one. In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" If the driver is not co-operating with the driverless car then an accident or something worse could happen, and would be the drivers fault. In passage 7, it says ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing up into an object."" If failed to do so an accident will accur on be blamed on the driver for not paying attention.

In conclusion, the driverless car should be developed. If an accident accurs then it would be the driver's fault unless something goes wrong in the car itself. ",2

9b04017,"Dear state senator i would like to argue the Electoral college, wheather to keep it or changing the election by popular vote for the president of the united states. Honestley i would like to get rid of it because there are so many things wrong with it, even the best-liad defenses are wrong because our vote does not really count the popular vote could be voting for one of the president while the representative that represents us could choose to vote for the other president if he wanted. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a straight up election to the kind we have now. For example take in consideration what happened the year 2000 when Al Gore was going against George. W Bush, Al Gore had won the popular vote which means that everybody wanted Al Gore to be president. But George. W Bush won the whole election because of the Electoral College. Under the Electoral College system the voters are not voting for the president, but for a slate elctors,they decide who the president is. Which if you think about it its un american because this is a free country and a democracy and if we are not realy picking but just mearley helping decide who is president in a democracythen yeah my opinion is that its un american. What most worries the people is the prospect of the tie in the elctoral college which in that case the votes will be sent to the House of Representatives where they choose the president which if you think about its bad because lets say that the HR is being governed by Republicans and you the voter is a Democrat, which way do you think the HR is going to go, Republicans right, and how would that make you feel, not very pleassent i assume. The Electoral College is a prcess not a place which means we can demolish it without getting people hurtthats why i propose that we crush the Electoral College hopefully all the information i've put in this letter has pursuaded you to help out your country.

sincearly PROPER_NAME   ",3
9b0e62f,"Dear State Senator,

I have realized that there has been debate lately about if we should abolish the Electoral College or not. Reading about this, you could swing either way and have a valid point, but I think my way has more valid points and makes more sense as a whole picture. The key here is the bigger picture because if you look at a small flaw of something for long enough it eventually takes up the whole picture in your mind. You may have your opions about it and I have mine but I would like to share mine with you so you can see why the Electoral College is still important and should still be used.

When our founding fathers sat down and decided to right up our federal government system, they argued emensly on voting and how it should go about. when they finished bickering and developed this system, they made sure everything had a checks and balances type of layout. With the Electoral College, "" you vote for the elector and they vote for president and vice president, and then congress counts the electorial votes"". This idea is more benefitial then just having a majority vote for obvious reasons. With the electoral votes and populus votes it makes it harder to choose a president just by a single vote advantage.

Now I know your probably yelling at this letter saying the disaster factor is the main problem with the electorial college but let me finish. there have only been two times that this has happened. ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes then bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888"". If this has only happened twice then I think it is something that is fixable, but should not be the deciding factor that takes away the whole Electoral College system. The main reason we have this system is so there is a certainty of outcome and not just one score that is judged.

The way this is set up is so that ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president"". This is a great thing because imagine if it was just majority vote; the most populated states could just vote who they wanted to be president and it would be done. No other states would be able to compete and on top of that the canidates for president would only have to campain in the populated states where they know they are already liked. The Electoral College is there so things aren't done in a jiffy. With this system the canidates actually have to work on trying to gain supporters in states where they may not be liked in. It also makes the American people think about all the options and decide on a bigger scale that requires more then just ""one vote"" to win an election.

Can you see why we need this Electoral College to stay and not just be abolished over like it is some plastic bottle on the highway that gets avoided and never gets picked up. We need people to stay activley involved in voting and I personally think the Electoral College does the best job with this. If the founding fathers spent months upon months just argueing about this single topic, I do not think they would just blow it off last second and come up with some giberish. If this system has worked this well this long then I think they must of done something right. Please consider my opinion state senator. ""Voters in presidental elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"".                 ",5
144a803,"I, think for one of my that we should keep, the old methods are founding fathers have created. The Electoral college has work for hundreds of years. Sure it has some flukes in the system but many can be buffered. Some problems can be fix, but we deffinitaly don't need to switch it up. for the Electoral College each party is eqaul in the race for president. Each candidate running for president in our state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen from by the candidates political party, the states vary on how they are to be selected. You help choose your stat's elector when you vote for president,  really because you vote for your candidate you really are actually voting for your candidate selected electors. After these few steps in the Electorical College once all the voting is settled a Certifcate of Ascertainment also declares the winning predsidential candidate in your state at a meeting in December of election year. The certificate is sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of offical records to the presidential election, then you wait.

Now, some people disagree with me on not keeping the old method. Some people thing now is a good time to start a new way, or tradition. many people of the US also thing that there are many flukes in the Electorial College. quoted "" At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters "". I strongly disagree with that quote because the voter no matter what is voting for there side. Weather they are voting for democrate, or republican the vote goes to an elector and then brought to state, which goes in as a vote for presidence. another quote released "" It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". Now how is that qouted true when for years the Electorial College has worked everytime.

Finally, the reasons on why we should keep the same method. The reasons on why we should keep these methods in general. These reasons are Certainty of Outcome, Swinging States, Big States, and the Avoidence  of Run-Off elections. All these reasons are valid reasons on why we should keep the sam method. Certainty of outcome we always have and outcome and rarly a problem. We have swinging states which gives each candidate a equal fight. Also big states in which can cause can great break through for a candidate if they win the state over. These are all valid reasons on for why we should keep the electorial college going.    ",3
ae9554b,"I think driverless cars sounds so fun, but a good idea? I don't think so. I think that sounds like a bad idea and a bit reckless.

Driving a car as a human you have control over everything, besides the other drivers. How fast you go, which way you turn, how close to the lines you are, it is somewhat safe this way but cars are still deadly no matter how much control you have. You need to have control over them, not a robot. Also in paragraph 2 is talks about how you will still have to navigate through roadwork and accidents, and when pullling out of driveways so what is the use if your still going to have do something or another. It would also be so much more expensive to sell and make.

c3c5ddb,"The ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform and not a face made by aliens. The reason for me saying this is because it states that it is a Mesa. According to the text it was formed by a huge rock that formed shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. I also say that each picture being taken could of had a better quality camera or maybe could've had a different angle that makes it look like a face is there. As it said in the text the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds just to see that it was a face. The clouds could have given shadows that made it looked like there was a face imprint. The face could've been just another Martian mesa, in the text it says mesas are common around Cydonia. NASA decided to make this public which made more people believe this is real . All this was made so people could believe there is life on Mars, after scientist had believed there was life on Mars. Once they decide to take more pictures years later ,they found out it was just a natural landform.",2
90fe430,"The ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" had many people talking and asking if there was alien life on another planet. Obviously that is not true because they had pictures that it was just a landform,it could have been a rock, and this has happened before, it is very common. The ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" does not prove that there is another life on Mars.

First of all, the face is a natural landform, a picture is proof of it being a landform. They also took pictures of the so called face and determined that it was a landform. In the passage it says "" When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

The picture was the proof in the pudding. Therefore there was not alien monument.

Secondly, this face on mars could be a rock. The world has seen many of weird shaped rocks to consider that the face was a weirdly shaped rock. In the passage it says "" A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" The thing about rocks are that they can come from anywhere, can be found anywhere, can look like anything, and can be anything. Therefore it is a rock, a weirdly shaped one.

Thirdly, it is common to find things like this. In the passages it says, ""There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" There was many other reasoning for this rock other than thinking that there was life on another planet. Therefore it is common it happens all the time.

Although people say that there is another life on Mars, so far there is not. There is proof with pictures, it is just another lanadform like a rock , and it is very common to find these things. To conclude, maybe one day they will discover life on another planet, but this was a false alarm.    ",4
597a56a,"The electoral college, despite being established by the constitution, is a corruptable system that should be abolished. The ultumate duty of the government is to protect and serve the people of America, yet our votes must go through this extra step to pick what will ultimately affect us most.

When we vote, we choose who will be running our affairs for the next four years. America needs a president who can govern us in this world of problems, so why would the system overlook portions of the public? What keeps the Members of the college in line with public interests? there is too much instability in the college for it to always align with the best interest of the American people because in its ""winner takes all"" policy it overlooks all members of that state who voted otherwise. The college looks at us like divided pieces, when we really are a whole puzzle. For example, when the majority of Floridians vote for one candidate, while just over half of the population of Texas votes for the other, looking at these two states only texas would win, despite more people in total voting for the other candidate. This may not seem like a common occurence, as article three stated it has happened only twice since 1888, but there is nothing to keep such actions from progressing.

What service does the Electoral college serve that the people cannot? its only purpose in the govenment is to elect the president. The public, however, is the life and soul of America. The government exists solely to keep order among us. There is no reason why a popular vote wouldn't show the best interest of the people, and a popular vote doesn't overlook any vote.

The greatest problems lie with the tie-breakers, because inthe event of a tie, the election's result goes to the legislature. a few people in congress are looking to fuel their own desires. when presented with the chance to earn more money, they would rather choose the option that will earn them more, even if it means going against the interest of the public.

The electoral college isn't a complete public enemy, however. The electoral votes are decided based upon a popular vote, so they reflect the public's interest, if a little distorted. Maine and Nebraska have an alternate setup of ""proportional representation"" as explained in article one. If anything is to be done, a simple reform would suffice. if electoral votes were awarded per a set number of people, it would better reflect the population than if votes were awarded entirely based upon the will of a state as a whole.

15d638e,"If driveless cars are comming in the future I dont know how i will feel about it. Growing up i never seen or even thougth abut driveless cars untill i was a teenager, i just thought about the cars now and days and is these the only cars that we will see in the future. I can't imagine it calling for a taxi if im far away and just getting in a car with no one in there, it would just be wierd, but it will be something that it will just be someting that i have to get used to. When i started to get older i did used to think about driveless cars because i started to see them in television shows and movies, and i also thought how it would change the world forever.

Some part i wouldnt trust it, if you really think about it self driving cars it sounds alittle dangerous. You have to really do alot of things while your driving, you have to use everything in your environment i just think if you made a driveless car you shouldnt have to worry about crashing or even tinking about it. If they did made a driveless car it should be able to drive whenever and wherever and more than just half a million miles without crashing i think you should be able to drive how long as you want.

Then details say that half a million miles without a crash, so does that mean that every half a million miles you are going to crash. I just dont know i think it will look very cool but the only thing that matters is that does it drive well is it really safe its alot of things that can happen. I do like that the detals in the passage say that if you want to take over the wheel you can take over whenever you wanted. Like i was saying you have to really pay attention when your driving from the cuts and turns and also the bad

traffic and then a driveless car, a car doesnt even have a brain it a vehicle not a living thing but one thing i do like is

all of the alerts and sensors that the car have to protect you.

Yes a drivless have good things but also could have some very bad things. Thats just like in a few states like California, Nevada, Florida and Columbia all of those states dont really allow you to use semi-autonomous cars they care about your safety. They just dont think it is safe because you are not driving the car, the car is driving by itself, there many good and bad things about this were just going to see what it is going to be like when it happens. Just like it say in the passage says if someone gets injured whos fault is the driver or the manufacturer.   ",4
fce26a2,"From man's very first trip out of Earth's atmosphere to the iconic moon landing, people from all across the world have always wondered what lies in the unknown solar system that surrounds them. Despite the danger and the failures that plagued these early scientists, they still strived to explore space and the planets within it. In writing ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author is able to very convincingly explain the benefits of exploring Venus, despite the dangerous challenges this endeavour may present.

The article starts off by describing Venus and providing background for the reader, allowing the writer to make a stronger and more understandable claim later on in the work. Venus, as described in the article, is often the closest planet to Earth, depending on the time, and is repeatingly called ""Earth's 'twin'"" because of its similarity in size and density to Earth. The author then goes one to describe the multiple missions already taken to Venus, which have all failed in the end.

While the author does state reasons why a mission to Venus could be treacherous, he or she is able to negate these downfalls by listing all the possible benefits of exploring this inhospitable planet. Venus is considered by scientists to be a dangerous planet to explore for many reasons included in the writing.

For one, its temperature far exceeds in heat any which the Earth has reached by hundreds of degrees. The atmoshpere of Venus also contains a corrosive acid which would be a great obstacle to any vehicle attempting to pass through. The author then goes on to give multiple other reasons in support of danger, but is finally able to oppose these concerns by listing all of the reasons why man kind should explore Venus. For one, Venus is the planet that is most near Earth and therefore will take the shortest time to journey towards. Space travel, the author includes, is very time consuming and not to be taken on lightly. In addition, scientists believe Venus may have once been exceedingly similar to today's Earth. By giving this information, the author is able to infer that information gained by a trip to Venus could be very much crucial to ensuring the survival of the planet home to a large amount of life. The writing claims, after all of these reasons, that ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable,"" despite the hardships explorers would face.

In further support of this claim, the author explains the multiple ways that scientists are testing in order to make a trip to Venus possible. The article shows that already, mutiple ideas have been proven to work.

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" is able to very sucessfully make the claim that Venus is worth exploring through negation of the dangers of such a trip by providing multiple benefits of a visit and the ways in which scientists have already found to make the trip possible. Exploration is exceedingly valuable to maintaining and improving life on Earth and, as written by the author, ""should not be limited by dangers and doubts.""   ",5
1abc9a4,"What if I told you that there were these special kind of cars that didn't require a driver to accelerate, brake, and basically any of the basic car functions? That it was all programmed to do these things? Sounds crazy, right? It may sound crazy, but it's happening. Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, has found a way to have cars to do just that. They're called driveless cars. I, personally, think that these cars are a terrible idea, to be honest. There are plenty of positive and negative aspects for these cars though, which I will talk about now.

These driveless cars sound pretty cool, right? They're very extraordinary really. Movies, television and books have imagined this moment for centuries, saying that the future would consist of them. Being ""pretty cool"" is just one of a few positive aspects. Obviously, you wouldn't need to drive, so if you got tired or bored, you could just be fine (under certain conditions, which I will discuss later). These cars also would have more flexibility than a bus and using half of the fuel needed for a taxi cab. That's a big deal with gas prices rising lately.

There's really only one negative aspect to these cars, but it's a pretty big one. You didn't think it would be perfect, did you? Everything has a flaw or twelve to it. That negative aspect is that you have to stay alert the entire time that you are driving. Yes, it is a driveless car, which is supposed to mean that you don't have to drive. That statement is only half true. The car is specifically made to do the basics, like accelerate, brake, turn, and other stuff. But, say there is an accident or an animal in the road. You'd have to turn out of the way so that you can get out of the way of it. They're not programmed to do so on their own. You have to do that. But, on the bright side, if for some reason you're not paying attention to the road, there is a car assistant programmed the car system. It would alert you of when you need to take control of the car to move out of the way, or something along those lines.

As you can tell, these ""driveless cars"" have some perks to them, but they also have some disadvantages to them as well. I still stick with my opinion of not having these cars though. It's not that much work to move your hands to steer a wheel and to push your foot down on a pedal to make it go and stop. The negative aspects weigh out the positive aspects, if we're being honest here. Google cars might be cool and might be ""the best thing possibly"" to other people, who are most likely lazy, but I stick with my opinion and hopefully, others will too. So, once again, I say that Google cars are not a good idea and should not be promoted. ",3
68dd043,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author; Nick D'Alto starts off by explaining how The picture shows that ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" after telling us this the author proceides by telling us how the emotions were recognized by a computer softwhere. Reading emotions can be tricky. But for a computer its different. The idea of basically reading Mona Lisa's mind and figuring out her emotion is somewhat confusing because the Mona Lisa is just a painting and there is no way to know if the Facial Action System is correct because the painting cant actually tell us how it feels.

In the artical it states that ""you can probaly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" We dont need a Computer to read students emotinal expressions because it is easy to tell how a student is feeling by how their face expresion is at the time or their attitude. even though this would be a great idea to put in classrooms it would also be conserning for the students because some students dont want people knowing how they feel because it might embarious them. But at the same time it would be good for techers because to learn you have to want to learn and if your in a not so good mood then you wont want to learn and with the Facial Action Coding System the teacher can see if the student wants to learn or not.

The mona Lisa demonstration is very intresting and it shows what all a computer can do. It is very amaizing how far the tech has came. Also it is crazy how a computer can know when you are happy or sad. There is a lot of good things to this subject and also a lot of bad things that come with it. An example of a bad thing is if someone dosent want you to know how they are feeling and they could get mad at you. A example of a good reason to see peoples emotion who seem suspious and up to no good.

In concluision I think that it would be a great idea to bring the Facian Action Coding system into schools because of the fact of seeing the emotions of students that arnt learing or working to the best they can be. Another reason is to help inprove those students and see who needs help or needs someone to talk to because they could maybe be going through a hard time but no one knows and the only thing that could figure is out is the computer software.",3
87c443a,"I agree that the Facial Action Coding System will be helpful in students and at schools. Because the system can detect a student's emotions, it can help a teacher learn more about that specific student. By knowing that a student is off guard or not paying attention to a certain lesson; the teacher can help that student on the lesson one-on-one. Not all students have the same emotions, so the students may not be getting taught well enough because of how the student might feel. The system can help a teacher realize that a kid might be mad and needs a certain activity to do before the class starts a lesson so the student can be content. Since more lessons will most likely be taught on computers, the teachers do not have to worry about wasting paper and money.

There is a downfall to all this greatness. More students will be on computers. That can cause damage in the eyes or brain. Some parents might not like the idea of their child being analyzed by a computer. Since the computer will use the camera to see the students face, the camera will have to be on. Parents might not like having their child exposed. Some teachers might not like the idea of having cameras on in their room for the same reason of being exposed.

Although there are more benifits than problems in the system. Students can be happier if the teachers notices that they are sad and actually do something about it. If the student is happy they will most likley be on topic on a lesson.

""Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad""(D'Alto). The computer will be able to detect your mood and help you be happy if you are feeling sad. Teachers will get to know their students more. Because the comptuer can tell a students emotions, it can give information for the teacher. The teacher might use that information to see if that child needs to talk to someone in private.

Schools should get the Facial Action Coding System because it benifits students and their ways of learning. It also helps teachers get to know their students more and help them out if they need help on a certain lesson if they feel confused. Kids will be happier if teachers recieve information that a student is sad and need joy in the classroom. Students will be less bored if the teacher gets information that her class feels sad. The teacher can help the students not feel bored by making the lesson somewhat intersing. That's why I think the Facial Action Coding System is a good idea to have in schools and any learing facility.",4
9800386,"1.) What is the Electoral College' A electoral college is a process, not a place. I didn't know they had 538 electors. majority of 270 electoral votes. Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . . The Congressional delegation one of each memeber in the house. But i do think the District of Columbia. is each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. Chosen a party political party, responsibilities. but what will happen if something happens to the congress what will go wrong? for the stuff that they be having partys for the policital paartys & stuff what do they do that for the things they have. like will the president be alright with this stuff that be going on but these things is good cause we will like the same things but idk know it that was alot of 538 electors but some of it will work.

2.) THe Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong' I understand what the American people is doing its a factor that some of yall got to learn thoe. Kennedy i don't understand his and they way he do like its alot for the candidate but for the other ones i dont know like what's up with the candidate and kenndey, the passage says .. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please... oh, and what if the state sends two slates of electors to Congress? it happened in Hawaii in 1960. Vice President richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent's electors, but he made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent."" what if that happend again? During the 200 campaign , seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . . Yes that's right they do have to make it to the candidate first they just can't walk up there first you got to be president by the pesident frist if you not by him or here then you messe dup for goood its not working out like that at all. it's official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it all mostly assertions in without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

3.) In 2012 election, for example, Obamma received 61.4 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney. . . . BEcause almkost all states award electoral votes on a winner -take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in astate creates a landslide electoral -vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . . The residents of each other regions are likely to be a successful presidents. The residents of other regions are likely to be feel disenfranchised- to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard. Swing States' [2012's] election- to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. . . . Big Staes' The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidentail candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . . Avoid Run-Off Elections' Nixon in 1968 and Clintion in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes , while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is presssure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate. . . . It can be argued that the electoral College method of selecting the president amy turn of potentail that is right because sometimes you really don't have that much of that stuff like that now but sometimes its hard to see stuff like that but you got to work on some things like that but not everything likec come on now. so candidates who do that some want. . . . But of course no voter's vote swings a naional election, and spite of that about one-half the eligible American population did vote in [2012's] election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . . Democrats in Texas, for example , or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect , tghey have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. . . .            ",1
6e5f68e,"Dear Senator of the state of Florida,

I would like to propose you to keep the electoral college in regards to how elections are made for the presidency and vice presidency. I in my opion as well as in other feel that by keeping the electoral college decisions on votes would be satisfactory for us in due to th e couting of our votes for the elections that we face. It would be a much rather delightfulness for the state of Florida if you would keep on helping sustain the electoral college and its' bases of funtion as well as in the rightchesness that belongs in our votes for the candidates that run for election either for presidency or vice presidency. Further more I wish to ask you to maintain our votes fair in wich i mean don't do an unfairness of our votes that is to say, our votes that get sent to you so that you can put in the final vote. As you may know there are many hateful critcism on how the electoral college functions and I'd like to say that if you could put up with the so many critics and just keep doing your job on electoral college then you could put up a positive ad on how the electoral college really works so that the many people that crtisize and have doubts on how the electoral college will truely know what is happening with their votes for election times. Our nation really needs this even though it is a really old system of governmence towards our voted that fall in you hands. for instance in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong""(paragraph 14) it states ""...The electoral college is...outdated"" this shows how even an article was written to discuss the faults in the electoral collage and how its sytem works. the electoral collage may recieve many hateful critism on how fair the electoral collage is, but all in all their shouidn't be anything to worry about knowing that what you're doing is right in terms of governance and politics. With all due respect I would like to thank you for helping sustain the the electoral college with your fellow out of state caleeges, its a pleasure having having you as our Senetor and this goes as for everyone that enjoys your supportment to the government and how its electoral elections are based due to this system. I hope this really helps on how our government system on elections are critized, and that for at least there are people that actually hope for the prosper of the electoral college and the benifits that come out of it as also the many unlawful things that could arise in the nation if we didn't have and electoral college. With all due respects I hope that your manegment of our votes in elections be used wisely in the electoral college unlike other places in the world where much is corrupted and is used against the people instead of for the people. Thank you for taking your time in reading this article Senetor of Florida.    ",1

89444f4,"Driverless cars dont even sound safe. Then don't ever sound useful if im being honest. Yeah it's something that we can make happen now a days but we can make flying cars a thing to.

Driverless cars can cause many accidents if you really think about it the driver will take advantage of the car. He or she driving the car will think it's okay to not pay attention because the car will let it know when something is about to happen what if its too late and an accident happens. What if the driver is intoxicaded and doesn't pay attention to what the car is saying. What if the car starts to mess up and the driver looses control of the car. There is so many things that can go wrong with this espicially now there are so many things going on with texting and driving and drinking and driving. Imagine the accidents that can happen.

What if the driver wakes up super early one day and are driving to work. They have the driverless car driving and they fall asleep because there not moving or doing anything simply because the car is driving itself you know how bad that accident can be? If you have a regular car that you control you will have to stay awake because you are the on moving it and controlling it but if you have the driverless car you arent really doing anything but trying to stay careful and paying attetention which can cause you to fall asleep. I don't see this has being safe what so ever so many things can go wrong so many people can get hurt. What if the driverless car messes up and they blame the driver and not the manufacturer many people would get angry.

If they really want this to happen there should be so many rules in the car. Some can be that every passanger has to have a seatbelt or the car won't move, the driver must have both hands on wheel the entire time the car is in motion. Not a single car can be to full. Loud alert signals when something is going to happen to aware the driver. A voice check to see who is driving etc.. It does sound appealing knowing you are going to get in a car and not have to drive it but me being safe and the others on the car are way more important then me being happy. I would rather be happy and safe and drive my own car then to depend on a car computer that can break down anyday.

Driverless cars are just not something that sounds safe what so ever. If you have someone driving for you then whats the point of learning how to drive learning how to park taking your time studying and preparing for the test all of that will be useless if you have a car that drives on its own most of the time. You know how many teenagers are going to try to take there parents driverless car just because it drives on its own and they know they won't get pulled over because the car is driving perfect. Many people are going to think its okay to be on drugs and intoxicaded because they wont have to worry about there driving.

This is just not well what so ever. There so many things wrong with this idea it can cause many problems. Many people are going to take advantage of the car. There's some people that are responsible but theres also many people that aren't.    ",4
e532ebd,"The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I think the best way to know who wins the election is by the majority votes to the candidate.

The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The voting system should be done like specificly, because if you setup different things it's not going to work at all. It depends what kind of setups you are making. But I think it's not the good way to make voting system in setups.

Each candidate running for president in our state has his or her own of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilties are.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The singal best argument against theelectoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky for the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the sysytem allows for much worse. Consider that state allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the elecrtoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of the Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one vote, the singal representative from Wyoming, representating 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the representative from California. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's seletion can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say thsi, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral; votes by increasing his plurity in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable resuly because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be succesful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to fell disenfranchised-to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.

It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state-Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicians in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by the popular vote. But of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

My only suggestion is to do the votes through the majority voters to the candidate because any kind of setups are not going to work. And the people are not likely going to believe all that stuff. It's kind of hard to do that but, it will going to work.    ",1

This could be something big, but you know it isn't alive, so you have to assume it is a landform. When you go back and show everyone what you found people think it is an alien, but further investigations show it is a natural landform. This Face is a natural landform because no one has ever seen something like this before, no one has any proof that it is a human or alien, and NASA and the Mars Global Surveyor say it is a landform.

First of all, no one has seen anything like this before. The text states,"" There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors."" This peice of evidence shows that the face is new to them, and they don't know what it is. Another piece of evidence is,"" Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars."" This, also, shows that NASA doesn't know what it is. If no one knows what it is then you can't say it is a human or alien without knowing the facts.

Secondly, no one has any proof that it could be an alien or a human. For instance, the text states,"" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa."" This piece of evidence shows that they can't figure out exactly what the face is. They are making aussumtions of what the face might be, but they aren't one-hundred percent sure of what it is. NASA would have to have proof to say it is an alien or not.

Lastly, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet he found out the face was a natural landform. For example, the text states,"" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform."" This shows that once they got a clear picture of the face, the JPL found out it was just an ordinary landform. The text also states,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" This piece of evidence found in the text shows that NASA figured out that the face was a landform. Yes, the face did look like a human, but the NASA found out it was a landform when they closely examined the it.

In conclusion, the face that was thought to be an alien or a human was clearly a natural landform. First of all, it was never seen before, so no one could be sure of what it was. Secondly, people just assumed it was an alien or a human, and they had no proof that it was. Lastly, the Mars Global Surveyor found out the face was a natural landform. This evidence shows that face everyone thought was an alien was actually a natural landform.       ",4
88be918,"When I first graduated high school I never knew that my life could change so fast. I was working two part time jobs at a grocery store and a bank and when my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat I couldn't say no because I knew that it was a lifetime opportunity. In the year of 1945 World War two was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins and Don and I signed up to go on the seagoing cow boy adventures.

When we got our seaman's papers SS Charles W. Wooster, we headed for Greece--with a total cargo of 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. I turned 18 before arriving in Greece and meant that I could possible be drafted for military service. When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service. By the time I was discharged in 1947, I had made nine trips---the most of any seagoing cowboy. ""The cattle-boat trips wre an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy."" ""Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China.

Seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special to me. It took two weeks to cross the Antlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept me busy.

I also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

In conclusion I think that everybody should become a Seagoing Cowboy because of all the sights especcially the Acropolis in Greece. Taking care of the animals is more than fun. On the return trips It was double the fun than going there we get to play games where the animals were once housed. I still can't believe that I was invited to become a Seagoing Cowboing.",2
50e0abb,"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author, Nick D'Alto, shows us that this technology that allows it to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. By using example of the human face muscles and Mona Lisa as an example, allows us to get into debt about our facial expression and what they give out to other people.

The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of student in a classroom is valuable because it will be able to read the muscles in the face that are being used in the expression we are doing. "" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major musces in the model must move like human musces.""

By creating a 3-D model of the face it allows it to have an exact replication of the face and muscles being used; therefore it will be able to show how people are really feeling. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, and, disgust, fear and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" By classifying every emotion with the musces allows the technology to get an an acurrate feeling of the person.

The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of a studemt in a classroom is valuable because in the passage it gives examples of the exact muscle and emotion that correlate with each other. "" For eample, your fronttalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your arbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomtic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of you mouth. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different musle, the risorius."" By using the muscles in the face, this allows us to see an exact repredention of the emotions the person is feeling and will help kids in the classrooms.

The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of a studemt in a classroom is valuable because it will allow the student to feel more comfortable in their learning enviroment and lern at their own pace. "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" By having this technology it will allow students to be more engaged in the learning and be able to undestand better the subject.            ",4
7cbb652,"A lot of people agree that limiting car usage is a great idea. it can help reduce stress. it will decrease all of the pollution in the air so we can live safer.

With the limitation of car usage it will help pollution all around the world decrease. This will be very useful because we wouldn't need to worry about global warming as much. With less pollution the next generation will be able to live safer knowing there air is not filled with dangerous toxins. This limitation will extremely benefit heavily polluted areas to limit the pollution and probably have the people live longer.

This limitation will also help reduce stress. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,""  says Heidrum walter. This goes to prove that without a car you dont need to worry about car related problems like car jams getting in your way of being late. It will also reduce stress by you dont need to worry everday not to get into a car crash and possibly lose your life.

With the limitation money can be saved. If you dont have a car you dont nedd to pay insurance. Without a car you dont have to pay for gas and that money can be used on other things. Some places fine people just for driving, so not driving would benefit.

As you can see this car limitation can benefit us a lot of way. Saving money, reducing stress, and air pollution is just a couple of great things.                       ",3
bd96783,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", I am against the development of these cars. I feel there is no purpose for these cars. You will still need a driver for these cars. These cars are a waste of money. These cars are also a waste of time. There is nothing wrong with reugular cars. We have been using regular cars for over 100 years, why stop now?

First of all, these cars will still need a driver. According to the author, "" they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all designed to notify the driver. That defeats the purpose of calling them ""Driverless Cars."" Why call them driverless cars if they still need a driver. It is not a smart idea.

Secondly, you are wasting money on something that is not effective. The name of the car does not match with the car itself. Why would you buy a "" Driverless car"" when the car is still going to need a driver. That is a waste of money. The ""Driverless Car"" will most likely be more expensive than a normal car. Although the car comes with more features, it does not live up to it's expectations.

Lastly, the car is a waste of time. The U.S is mostly low and middle class people. The driverless car will not be sold as quickly as other cars because the prices of the car will most likely be a mini fortune. Not many people would buy this car. Not many people complain about cars today. People are so used to driving normal cars that they would probably rather drive than pay more money for a car that ""alerts"" the driver.

In conclusion, I am against the development of this "" Driverless Car"". I think it is ineffective. It is a waste of money. The car is also a watse a time. You also willstill need a driver for this ""Driverless Car"" so there is no purpose of it. ",2
a342503,"Driverless cars should be developed. Many cars already have a step towards the driverless car, like the 2013 BMW. The 2013 BMW has already been developed with a ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" Cars will keep being developed for the safety of anyone driving the car. Cars are made sure to be well manufactured, so why not allow a driverless car to be made?

If cars now are being made for better saftey, then why not trust that a driverless car would be safe as well? Many car now are being made with systems that make the car have more control than the driver. A driverless car could help to prevent car accidents from happening. By the time a driverless car is allowed to be made, other cars would have better construction to it and a diverless car would also have those better constructions for the saftey of anyone in the car.

Cars have progressed from the time they were created to now. If the saftey of the car has been improved, then why not let car companies be able to create better ones. As cars are manufactured more, they get safer and safer. By the time a driverless car is created, or is planning to be created, it will be very safe. The creators could also make a setting to make the car go back to being manual if its too much of a scare for the driver.

If the law would let a car company create at least one driverless car for a test, then they could see if the idea is a good or bad choice. Many things have been tested to see if they are well enough to be produced to the people, or if it should be denied. Testing a product is always the first thing to do when it comes to being able to sell them, so why not make a draft of one before seeing if its a good idea to make it or not.

As a conclusion to my argument for the development for driverless cars, I believe that they should be created. With more and more cars being created to almost replicate driverless car, why not start making them and testing them. Driverless cars would eventually be created and many people would have them. It would be better to get a head start on teh driverless car to see what modifications still need to be done before selling them to the public. Also less car accidents would be likely to happen, and driveing on roads and streets would be safer for all the people.",4

""The rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexable communting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"", This states that cellphone apps has made it possible for more people to get involved in car pooling by arrangingments such as, vans, buses, cabs, or even in a car with friends.

3e23101,"The author suggestment of study Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because it is most earthling-like planet than any other planet in the solar system, also we have perfect eqiupment for humans to survive a great travel in the planet of Venus.

The reason that they want to study Venus is because it is the most Earth type than any other planet. In the text, "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. long ago, Venus was probably covered just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and crters""( 4 paragraph The Challenge of Exploring Venus)

The other reason that they want to study Venus and not knowlegding the dangers because we humans can still survive the climent with good eqiupment. In the text it says "" NASA's possible solution to float above the fray. imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.

At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures wolud still be toasty at aqround 170 degrees Faqhrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"" (4 paragraph The Challenges of Exploring Venus).

f4ab05d,"I whole heartedly believe driverless cars are becoming the future and I can agree with that but its just not that simple.

Additionaly you can see some other flaws as well

What will road conditions do to this self drivin cars. If a situation arises that requires a human driver and the car is driving its self or worse the human can even control the car. What could occur then? A car accident is not uncommen in these situations.

The law however is even bigger of an issue! the law states that self driven cars are illegal in some states!

ab23678,"Would you risk your life to search for answers that might just end up dissapointing you? Well I'm asssuming that the author of this article would. The author talks more about the bad things about Venus than the good things, which doesn't help his/her claim that it ""is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". In this article, the author talks more about the hardships Venus's enviroment would provide than the benefits, he/she talks about how hard it would be to build a spacecraft to even withstand Venus's envirmonet, and he/she doesnt't provide any points or ideas to why we should want to visit there.

The author mentions that Venus's atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide. Not only is the atmosphere 97 percent carbon dioxide, it also contains ""clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid"". Temperatures on Venus average around 800 degrees fahrenheit, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet, which would be impossible to maintian human life, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times what we have here on earth. All of paragraph 3 is just talking about the negative's of Venus, which doesn't support the authors claim that these risks are worth finding out any information.

In paragraph five, the author talks about how NASA is trying to build a spacecraft that can withstand Venus's envirmonet. He/she explains in paragraph 2 that no spacecraft that has been sent to Venus has ever survived the landing for more than a few hours. The author talks about how NASA wants to build a blimp that will hover 30 miles above the surface of Venus so that is can avoid the harsh conditions on the surface, although right after this, he/she states that even 30 miles up off the surface, Venus is still going to be around 170 degrees Farenheit. The extremly high air pressure, heat, harsh storms, etc will all have to be concidered when trying to build a spacecraft that will be able to survive on Venus. Once again, these paragraphs are not explainging much good that is coming out of a manned trip to Venus.

Throughout the article, the author talks about very little benefits that come when sending a man to Venus. Scientists do believe that Venus was once covered with large oceans and might have had a variety of life forms. But this means nothing to us now if it's all destroyed. We will never for sure know if there was once life there, all of the evidence is gone. Honestly, what is the point in even going to Venus? Temperatures of 800 degrees would have burnt everything. Besides, why does is matter to us if there was once life there? We should focus on Earth and how we need to start taking care of it, before it ends up like Venus. There was no solid point in this article that honestly pursuaded me to want to send someone to visit Venus.

In conclusion, I do not think the author supported his claim well, he talked more about the negative parts of Venus, about how hard it would be to build something to trasport them there, and he/she never really states anything persuading the reader about why it would be good to visit Venus. Although it would be intresting to find out stuff about Venus's past, no one will ever know the absolute truth. ",5
c8b339f,"In 1976, Viking 1 took a picture of what looked to be a a human face on Mars. A few days later the picture was reviealed to the public eye, and it was starred in hollywood film movies, books, magazines, and talks shows. But in 2001, new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Global Survey spacecraft revealed that it was only a mesa. Though there are many credible reasons to believe that it was only a mesa, some people still believe that is an alien artifact.

Yes, one might think that the mesa looks like a face from an egyptian Pharoh, but after closer examination, it was only a natural landform. We are able to prove this because on April 5,1998, when Mars Global Sureyor flew over for the first time, a picture was taken that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos that showed only a natural landform. When the picture was unveiled to the public eye, it had a caption that told people it was a mesa that resembled a human face only because shadows that were on the rock gave an opticl illusion of eye,nose, and mouth. Also on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enogh for a second look and used the cameras absolute maximum resolution to take an even better picture that again showed that it was only a mesa. From these pictures alone you can tell that there wasn't a face on Mars and that there isn't any extraterrestial beings living on Mars.

in conclusion, the ""face"" on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform that you can probably see on Earth. Also if there were to actually be life on Mars, it would be a major break through that would help better fund NASA, so what would be the piont in trying to hide it from the public that funds our research? There would be no piont in doing so which means that there isn't any life on Mars and the face is only a mesa or butte.",3
88b3fa9,"I believe that using this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a bad idea, most people hide their emotions for a reason. Whether its struggle in class or things happening at home, they'll talk about it if the teacher can help but its best to keep those things to yourself and figure out how to deal with it or talk to a professional about those things. In some cases it may help, some people might become dimented or tormented by something on their mind and make rash discisions that harm themselves and others around them. The new technology would probably be very expensive and difficult to implament and gain the permission from parents and school officials who may be confused about it. Many schools are struggling with money and financial issues and there are far more important things to do and invest on rather than spending money on technology that may not even work 100% and only add on to problems.

Can we actually ""calculate"" emotions like math or something? How can computers recognize facial movements humans use to express how we feel? Each human has their own smile and their own unique way of showing their emotions. How can a computer that doesn't have its own intelligence or will discern how a human actually feels? Humans can simply look at someone and tell how they are feeling on the surface but humans also hide things deep within their mind. Most people who trully hold someone dere and care about them can tell when a person is hiding something through more than just facial expressions and facial movements. They can tell how a person feels by the way they are speaking and the way they move their body or thourgh physical changes throughout their body.

I think its nearly impossible for computers to access how a person feels at a moment, whether in class or physicalogical treatment. I believe that only humans and close companions can truly discern how a person is trully feeling, there's just something thats unique to certain people that people around them can feel. A certain atmosphere that people carry and only people close to them can truly understand. Not even specifically trained people can 100% judge how a person is feeling so how could a computer thats not living do it?",4

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which is landforms common around the American West. I believe that the Face is just a natural landform because it is hard to find,it actually shows the Martin equivalent of a mesa,and aliens don't exsist.

The Face is a natural landform. You can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size,so if there were objects in the picture you could see what they were. Each pixel in the 2001 image spamsa 1.56meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. It also says in the passage that its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Some people believe that the alien marking were hidden by haze. Thats when mission ccontrollers decided to look again, and thats when they said, ""Its not easy to target Cydonia, it is a lot of hard work"".

With all this data that has been revealed people should think that its just a natural landform. If there was aliens that did this their markings would be other places besides just here. Even though some people aren't satisfied with this more things in the future can happen to make them believe this. Maybe if more pictures are taken then peoples thought of view with change.

82bf172,"Limiting car usage might be a thought most of us wont even think about. But thats not the case. Countrys from all over the world are partaking in this new way. The reason why people are doing this is to clean the polluted air we breath in

A growing project that europe introduced is suburbs without cars. In Europe  a town in Germany constructed this experimental suburb project . For little to no cars in the community. This place is home to 5,500 residents and there are practically no cars, the main source of transportation is a tram. You are allowed to own aa car but its an extra $50,000 a year. In America they are not close to carring out this idea. But in the last year the number of license are going down and the number of cars being sold and hiw much we are driving. This concludes that we are taking i consideration how much emissions we are putting into the air.

In FRance, Paris enforced a partial ban on driving to clear smog of the city.

On monday motorists with even numbered plates were ordered to leave cars at home. The same would apply for the odd numbered plated the following day. Public transportation was free from friday to moday. These ideas helped clear the air of pollutants. But it took a long time because of hoiw much pollution was in the air due to France favoring diesels over gasoline.

Another way people are cleaning the air and limiting car usage is a car free day. In Bogota, Columbia  the gial of this is to promote alternative transportattion and reduce smog. Bogota is a large city homed to 7 million citzens. This idea of a day without cars was started in Bogots in the 1990's, because of this parks and sports centers have booms and many miles of bike trails have been constructed for the recreational; use but also to urge people to not use cars and clean the air.

These ideas have been expressed to reduce the usage of cars. Using cars less will have a huge effect on the ozone and how much pollutant is in the air.                    ",2

""Oh it's nothing."" replies Charlie who's obviously not as happy as he always is. Thomas would sure like to know how is friend is feeling; but he can't because there's no humanly way possible to if Charlie doesn't want him to know right? Well actually he can. There's a new kind of technology called Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, which enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable. Like in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, it could be used to show when a kid is becoming bored and let the teacher know so that the instructor could switch the lesson up to grab the kid's attention. Another effective was it could be used would be for it to show how some kids are feeling to limit them getting into any kinds of trouble. And finally it could be used to detect if one student just isn't grasping the matter of the subject that everyone else is getting with no problem. There are endless ways this technology could be used to better a classroom and this technology should be used in a classroom with students.

In the article, Nick D'Alto used a quote from Dr. Huang which was ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" In the sense that kids often time get bored in class, hence the reason they have a bad grade or get in trouble in that class, something has to change. Maybe it's the child's fault, but your traditional lesson isn't the most fun. If the instructor could find out what's boring the child and change the lesson to keep the child entertained then maybe the child wouldn't get into so much trouble with that teacher or maybe the child's grade in the class would take a huge leap. Who says learning can't be fun? With FACS learning could be something kids like to do.

In addition to keeping everyone awake, FACS could be used to keep people who aren't feeling too good get better. Everyone deals with things that others probably don't know about. With FACS a student could come into class like Charlie and no one knows about his frustrations so they try to do their normal jokes and games with him. If a student ever comes into class not feeling the best or not wanting to be bothered, FACS could sense that and instead of people messing with that kid or having that kid be bothered, that child could have the option of being away from everyone while the child cools down. That could stop the child from being involved in a physical altercation or any altercations at that.

Finally, everyone knows that all children learn at their own speed. FACS could be used to find out whose stuck on someting that everyone is flying through.

When the teacher is teaching something that everyone but one student understands and the teacher stops for questions, that one student may feel too embarrassed to ask a question so the lesson would go on and only get more difficult as time goes by. Instead of that happening, FACS would let the teacher know what kid that is so that the teacher could reach out to the kid and give them extra practice or even a little tutoring if they need it, that could really be a huge help to children that don't learn as fast as others. Usong FACS to determine that could really translate for the great or good of the grades of students everywhere.

In order to make the classroom a more happy place, a better place, FACS should be used with students. FACS could detect bordem so that no kid is bored enough to drift into space or sleep and miss valuable work time. FACS would be good for keeping kids that are dealing with things away from people that'll trigger them. Also FACS can be used to show weather or not children have questions and need help but are embarrassed to say so. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable.    ",5

There are many disadvantages and advantages for using any type of veichle and burning up fossil fuels . Cars can take you wherever you desire faster than any other type of land transportation but in the process of traveling in your car, your car is in the action of burning fossil fuels that later on will turn into harmful gas which hurts the enviroment around us . Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, drving less and getting fewer licenses each year . Every year we should decrease the amount of cars being used because excessive car usage can be a big hit to the atmoshpere and your wallet . There are more advantages of limiting car usage than disadvantages because humans dont really need cars to naviagte their way in life.

Excessive amount of car usage can be really harmful as well to the people driving on the streets . There are likely more accidents if the population of cars on the streets increase because if one tiny crash occurs and the streets are over popluated that one tiny crash can now become a huge crash with the other vechiles around it . Cold nights in France and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions and due to this lots of smog was created and the roadways were shut down to its lack of vision , this could've been provoked if diesel fuel was'nt over used in France. Limiting car usage is a great factor because there so if it happens , less car accidents will occcur , the action of global warming will decrease , money being spent on gas will decrease and our atmoshphere would'nt be all gassed up with burned fossil fuels .

Many people also suggested that everyone should cut down the car usage and all the fossil fuels being burned up because it causes lots of stress , Heidrun Walker is a mother of two and a media trainer stated ""When i had a car i was always tense . I'm much happier this way."" As a result to Walkers statement , many people agree with her because when you have a car you have to worry about buying gas and what if you dont have money for gas, what if you dont make it on time and you need to go pick up your child , there are so many ''what if's'' and problems when having a car . When not having a car you can save up lots money in your bank account , you can take care of the atmoshpere by not burning and using up fossil fuels and you can decrease the percentage of you getting into a severe car accident .

Limiting car usage brings alot of advantages to yourself and everyone around you and also some disadvantges . Many people can benefit from not having or limit the car usage because it can save you lots of money and take care the enviroment your living in . There are many solutions to get somewhere rather than using a car that when using fossil fuels to harm the atmosphere it raise the percentage of global warming .  Limiting car usage can help save the planet , cause less deaths around the world , save money , reduce the percentage of global warming and allow living things to breath oxygen and not harmful gasses that can hurt the respiratory system .

But wait.. there is barley any space to park, like, a bus. A lot of people are happy they don't have cars. Everything is near by. The district is really small. If they go out of their house and wanted to walk to their local grocery store the store would be right across the street.

After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Some drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded due to their reaction of the fine. The cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel was there to blame. Diesel's made up to 67 percent of vehicles in France compaired to a 53.3 percent average.

In Bogota, Colombia cars have been banned for three years only having buses and taxis as their transportation. If they had a car, they would have recieved a $25 fine. This whole car banning thing was an event because two other cities joined and they were Cali and Valledupar. Colombia isn't that small of a city. People need transportation. I mean, yeah a lot of people mostly hike, but what if they need a car to really get somewhere, like, if it was an emergency? But after this car banning, Colombia has made an improvement. There has been construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city. Uneven, pitted, messed up sidewalks has been replaced with broad, smooth sidewalks.

Obama's goal is to save the greenhouse gas emissions. Obama has been seeing that barley anybody has been buying cars. Why? The money is rising. Cars and gas has been getting expensive. America's love with vehicles has been cooling. In 2005, car driven miles has dropped steadily. In April, 2013, the miles driven per person has dropped 9 percent to where it has been below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Now, the greenhouse has been getting better plants.

In conclusion, car bannings has made a huge improvement in countries and states. Gas is being lessed used, greenhouse has been getting better plants, people don't really need cars if they have everything near buy but in some cases they do for emergency. The driving miles on cars have decreased incredibly. In Bogota the streets, and bicylce lanes have improved. There arent anymore jacked up sidewalks. Money has been saved to make the world look like a better place.    ",3

70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and the 57 percent sold a car to move there. Some say they feel happier now than before when they had a car. Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced drastically. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the U.S.

In the new approach to make cities denser, and better for walking stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. In teh U.S., the Enviornmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legistors are starting to act, if cautiously. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other tansport.

After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters, an international news agency headquartered in London; 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

b446f57,"Cars, have been a way that almost everyone uses to get to point A to point B since around World War 2, And for awhile they were always growing in popularity. It seemed for awhile that cars were going to be around for some time. Almost everyone had a car, from the young to the old, all over the world people were driving. But that's going to change soon in the always evolving world.

""All of our developement since World War 2 has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" says David Golderg, an offical of Transportation for America. In the suburban community of Vauban, Germany residents are giving up their cars in an attempt to promote car-free communities. As a result 70 percent of Vauban's families don't own a car! The members of the outstanding community actually like not having a car, Media trainer Heidrun Walter said ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Heidrun Walter isn't the only one thinking this way 57 percent of the population of Vauban sold their car to move there. But Vauban isn't the only community who thinks this way... All over the world more and more commmunities are thinking this way.

Paris, France, puts a ban of driving due to smog pollution due to the main usuage of diesel fuel. Paris usually has more smog than other European capitals as it is with it having cold nights and warm days trapping car emissions. The smog, which was progressivly getting worse, rivaled even that of Bejing, China, which is the one of the most polluted places in the entire world. The ban took place on a Monday for even-numbered liscened plates and Tuesday for odd-numbered liscened plate numbers. But even with the ban almost 4,000 people were fined a fee of 22 euros ($31). The smog cleared eough with those who did participate that they didn't have to enforce the Tuesday ban, which goes to show that even a large city can fight something as global as pollution.

The people of Bogota, Cali, and Valledupar, Colombia take a day out of the year to have a car-free event. Bogota, the capital of Colombia, with a population of 7 million have been doing this for 3 years to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. The violators of this event face a $25 fine, and probably more than a few disapproving looks for those who like to participate. People around the world go to join Colombian cities in their day without cars. This is Cali and Valledupar's first year and hopefully not their last either! The day without cars is part of a improvement campaign started in Bogota in the mid 90s, which saw the construction of over 100 miles of bicycle paths, according to the city's mayor this is the most of any Latin American city. To encourage people to walk around more they fixed the uneven, pit filled side walks with bigger smooth version, and rush hour restrictions have been imposed which has dramatically decreased traffic, plus new upscale resturants and shopping districts have popped up.

In the United States studies are showing that more and more Americans are buying cars. Young people are becoming less interested in having a car or even a liscence. In the year 2005 the number of miles driven was at its highest but since then it has steadly decreased by 9 percent. The number of miles driven now is equal to that of january in 1995. Part of the drop is due to the recession going on, no one can afford to get new cars, and the unemployed don't work so they don't have as much as a reason to get a car. If the pattern keeps going as it is with less and less people driving the next few years in America and possibly around the world will be years of change that will change how things work for generation to come.                                                                                                                                                                               ",3

The presidential election is held every four years on a tuesday after the first monday in november. Having the popular vote can help choose for preident much easyer. The popular vote helps know which candidate many people are voting for which president.

Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system. The system awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The word ""sate'' also refers to the district of columbia. The 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state. Keeping the popular vote lets the people vote for president. The candidate with the most votes wins and becomes president. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.

Voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose again the presindency. Under the college system the voters vote for a state elector who in turn elect the president. In 2000 there was a dispute over the out come of the electoral college. It is till less likely than a dispue over the popular vote. Each condidate has there own group of electors. Changes should be made to the Electoral college. Some of those changes include leting the people vote for president not a state of elector.

The electora college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states  lose. They lose it by virtue of the mal-apportionment. The Electoral college avoids the problem of elections. In which no candidatereceives a majority of the votes cast. The electoral college was established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of equalified citizens.

""The thing that made it could have not been seen on your pictures."" said the enthusiast.

""The machine we used to take the pictures, its pixels spans 1.56 meters. Once you saw them, you could zoom in on them. If there were any life forms on Mars, we would have seen it.

178a1c0,"Today's world is full of ideas and innovation. Sometimes there are good ideas, and sometimes there are bad ideas. You can never expect all good ideas from one person, and that brings me to Sergey Brin, co-founder of the world's biggest search engine Google. Brin states his company is developing a car that operates without a driver- to an extent. Do not be fooled, Google has not came up with a completely autonomous car, though the project's future does seem bright.

There are many faults when it comes to a self-driving car. First, you will have to understand that, despite all of the technological advances brought on by our society, the car has advanced fairly slowly. With this, one has to realize the change from a car controlled by a person to a car controlled by itself may not be well-suited.

Secondly, there seems to be somewhat of a complication when it comes to regulations of a new concept. For example, in the passage ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"", the author brings up the issue with creating new traffic laws in order to accomodate the autonomous car. Would that not be a hassle? In my opinion, there are far more things to worry about than a driverless car. All of the time used to create laws, roadways, hubs, and so forth could be spent on medical research or fixing our environment.

On the other hand, the industry of making and manufacturing these cars and their components could create jobs for people living in our desperate country. On the flipside of that, what if, similar to all other industries, labor is outsourced in order for companies to establish an edge early? When dealing with social issues such as these, all conditions must be considered before moving on.

With this idea of self-driving cars, I really can not say I agree with the project. I feel like if there ever was to be a car like that, the problems would far outway the common good of it all, and perhaps the whole thing would turn into a hastly jumbled mess. All in all, the idea of an autonomous car seems outlandish and unnecessary, not to mention sloth in an already lazy America.          ",3

2750d35,"Why does electoral college still have its defenders, Abolish the electoral college!... Electoral College was a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I am writing to the state senator of florida to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I am certain that we should keep the eletoral college because of three simple reasons. The Electoral College is a way of certainty of outcome. Swing states, and to Aviod run-off elections.

To commence I say the system of electoral college should stay because it has a certaint of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. This has happened before in 2000. In 2012 election, for Obama he received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, the Republican nominee for president in 2012. electoral votes arenon a winner-takes-all basis. A tie in the nationwide electora vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number.

To continue the second reason why I think th electoral votes should stay is becasue of sing states. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

Last but not least electoral voting should stay because to aviod run-off elections. The Electoral College also aviods the problem of election in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 are good examples, they both only a had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes. Some potential voters who have no hope have less in centive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular votes.

To briefly wrap up I argue in favor for the Electoral Votes to stay because of the certainty of outcome, swing states, and lastly to aviod run-off elections. In some people's opinion's they would disagree, but they will not have enough facts to support why they disagree, because honestly Electoral Votes is always the way to go.              ",4

People from all around the country don't think that the electoral college is a intelligent way of voting. So they are fighting changing the electoral process to popular vote rather than voting for a state of electors.

Our best arument we have to go against the electoral college is the disaster factor. Document 1 ""

What Is the Electoral College?

"" states, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This is basically saying we can't trust our electors to really vote for what they are assigned. That is like not being able to rely on the school bus to take you to school in the morning, its not a great sense of doubt.

Another reason not to use this outlandish method of voting is that the total number of electoral votes (538) is an even number. Which means there could be a tie. Another thing worth mentioning is that one candidate can win the popular vote but have fewer electoral votes. That is exactly what happened to Al Gore and that was largely part of this bogus system our country continues to uphold.

The electoral college should be abolished. It has caused nothing but problems for us in the past years. From ties, to innacuracy of votes, to causing re-counts. The electoral college is not putting America in the right direction. Most people don't like change, I am one of those people. Although, this change is for the better.

Also Dr. huang observes that artists such as da vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

Dr. Huang also stated that most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication. Dr. Huang also gave some examples of what movments to do in front of a mirror. For example raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. second squint your eyes slightly,to produce wrinkling (""crow's-feet"") at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up,toward your eyes.

They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the Zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Meanwhile,muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes.

df524e5,"Dear state senator,

The Electoral College has been around since the Constitution of the United States of America was composed. Is it outdated? Probaly, however just because something is old does not mean that is doesn't work anymore. Why should be get rid of the electoral college? It is still working, and it is very effiecient at what it does. We must keep the Electoral college to keep the voting for the presidency under control.

The Electoral College is made up of 538 electors, so that means you need at least 270 electoral votes to win the Presidency. However, there is a very small chance that a tie will occur. In source two the author states that if there was a tie in the electoral votes, the election of the President would turn to the House of Representatives, and the Senate would vote for the vice-president. Each delegate would get one vote, so the state of Rhode Island would have just as much say as the state of Florida.

Since the popular vote does not decide the presidency, it is very possible that the electoral vote doesn't side with the popular majority vote. However that is very rare, and only happens maybe once a century. In source three the author stated that in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than George Bush, it was the first time since 1888 that the electoral college didn't side with the popular vote. It is very possible, but very unlikely.

There is no one region that has more electoral votes than the other, so no one region is suprieor to the rest of the regions. The candidates are required to travel to other regions, so all regions can see what the candidates campaign is, and see who the electors will be voting for.

If we did get rid of the Electoral college, there will be consequences. For example, in source three the author stated that only half of the population eligible to vote will even vote. Some people vote because they believe that they are the people who decide the presidency. The electors are people who want to express a political view point, than just vote just for the sake of voting.

Mr state senator, as you can see we must keep the Electoral college rather than switch to a popular vote for presidency. The Electoral College was created to last forever, and so far it is doing just that. If we get rid of the Electoral College, we will regret it.                                                                                     ",3

175419b,"Today, there are many arguments between keeping our governments way of electing a new president. Many people have turned their back on the Electoral College saying that it is unfair and are instead for changing to election by popular vote. The Electoral College is seen as a non-democratic method of selecting a president that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes is the winner. Therefore it is the electors who elect the president, not us people. Some people even see the Electoral College as unfair. outdated, and irrational and see arguments against direct elections spurious. While some have different opinions saying that the Electoral College, although its lack of democratic pedigree, is very practical.

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required a elect a president. Your state's amount of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation. One for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. So, technically when you vote for your candidate you're actually voting for your candidate's electors. Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. All in all, it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.

Most states do award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, some things in a state could create a landslide electoral vote victory in that state. A tie is possible because the total number of votes is an even number, but is highly unlikely. In the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states that are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. Statistically, the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balnce that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionmen of the senate decrees in the constitution. So, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

The argument between keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote has many different sides to it. Through facts and opinions, there is many reasons our government should keep the Electoral College and some reasons that we should change to election by popular vote. In some ways the Electoral College can be unfair but in others it makes complete sense. The people who vote in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference not people who think that a single vote could decide an election. Therefore, the Electoral College could be a good thing in our government today keeping things organized and sometimes fair.                    ",3

As such, it may not be perfect, but it does more work so that the driver does not have to. This was partially the goal of driverless cars.

If these cars become a reality and the need of human drivers becomes obsolete, accidents will be greatly reduced. Perfected driverless cars can lead people into an era where people do not have have to rely on their cars to not let them die in an accident. Instead, we will rely on the vehicles to not cause an accident. It will also cause drunk driving to become a thing of the past because the car will do the driving in place of the drunken person. Rather than thinking solely of the recreational aspects, the safety that comes with these cars will cause them to become adopted into states more easily.

As such, driverless cars should be sought after by companies and people so that they worry less on the road and its dangers and more on having a family friendly time in cars like sedans.",3
92543c9,"Venus's reputation is challenging for humans to study. It's a thick atmospere of close to about 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. Venus is even more challenging because ther're clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in there atomospere,on their surface ther're tempature averages at about 800 degrees farenheit. And the atmospheric pressure is about 90 times greater than what our scientist are experincing on our own planet. Venus's conditions are far more extreme than anything we humans encounter on earth.

Venus's weather has additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. An paragraph 6 sentence 1 it says that venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk. Also an paragraph 7 sentence 2 its says Venus surface have lasted for three weeks in such condition that another project is looking back an to the old technology.

However, peering at Venus on a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot ttake samples of rock, gas, or anything else froma a distance.",1
1eac966,"This piece is about why scientist should explore Venus. The author supported his or her claim of exploring Venus well. The author provides evidence to counter Venus's harsh conditions.

The author gives many reasons why Venus is a dangerous planet. For example, the author says that there is a thick atmosphere that is 97 percent carbon dioxide, not only that but the clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acid. The surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 times that of Earth's. The author also mentions that the geology and weather is chaotic as well. The author manages to give some evidence for each of the dangers of Venus. He or she states that scientists can hover thirty-some miles above the surface to avoid geological and most weather hazards. It is also said that hovering up high will decrease the temperature down to about 170 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure to Earth's sea level. This gives the idea that a human survivng on Venus is not easy but possible. The author gives that fact that NASA is currently working on electronics that can withstand Venus's surface, and the longest it has lasted is three weeks, so scientists can gather artifacts from Venus and study them.

The author provides evidence in that scientists are currently working to combat Venus's harsh conditions. The evidence present shows that it is possible to counter the planet's harsh conditions and also how close the humans are to being able to explore Venus. ",3
e16d17c,"Have you ever driven a car? If so, were you actually driving or was this car a driverless car? Many people are preferring to ride in driverless cars or semi driverless cars. Without your eyes on the road, how can driverless cars be safe? The Author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" gives examples of how driverless cars can result in being late, more expensive, and more acciddents.

In the story "" Driverless Cars Are Coming"" paragraph three, states many companies that have started making these driverless cars. One being General Motors, whose idea was towards ""Smart Roads"". Having smart roads would be rediculous becuase of the expensises in using magnets and the special car sensor needed. If we had smart raods, and the road broke, what would we do? Basing all of our driving on a ""Smart Road"" would increase the risk of it breaking and everyone being late.

Okay, so smart raods are a terrible idea. What about smart cars? Google came out with a Toyota Prius. The prius uses postion-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a roatating senor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automatic radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. Sounds cool right? There are a couple problems with all of this stuff on a car. The first problem being that if one thing broke it would be super expensive. the second problem being if one thing broke nobodywould be able to drive at all. The last problem with all of the gudgets on the car is having the extra weight on the car would make the gas milage go through the roof.

So, smart roads and smart cars are starting to sound like a bad idea. Still can not make up your mind? Take the human mind as a consideration. These smart cars would make humans lazy. If we had these driverless cars we would not pay any attention to whats going on on the road. In the story ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" paragraph eight reads "" some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment. Think about what would happen if a car had a malfunction, would the other riders in the driverless cars be paying attention? Think about if a kid ran in the street after thier ball, would the car or the driver know? Finally, think about how much boring the world would be if you only rode in the car not drove it? Would you see the the beautiful blue sky or the amazing adventure of the forest? No, you wpould not. The little things are what make driving such a privledge not a right.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea. As people, we should always look ahead at what is in front of us. In ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", the author states both good and bad ideas of the driverless cars, I encourge you to think about the little things and the bad thing, on why we should not allow driverless cars.

I also believe this because the rock is in a shape, looking from the surface of the planet, of an ordinary butte or mesa, which is a small flat like mountain. Especially the way it looks there has been no sign of any life on mars yet. The way the rock is shaped, it is only shadows that make the face anyway so it couldn't have intentionally have been a face. The rock alone by it's self is just a bunch of rock lumped in a form made by the planet.

a4c08a2,"In ""The challenge of exploring Venus"", The author suggest that studying Venus would be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, I believe that even with the danger it can cause, it would be a nice experience. Venus is so close to the moon that you would possibly be able to see it from just a glance. In the article it stares that b eing able to see venus just from th sky because it is so close to the sun, Nasa should be able to go up to space.Having someone go up to space to land on venus would bring back so much information about that planet. One day if something were to happen to earth, scientist would want to know if there is a possibilty that you can go to another planet, one that will have the same qualities that earth had. As hot it could be since Venus is so close to the sun, it could be good to know that if something were to happen, we would have somewhere else to go. Although I believe that somethung could happen while in space because in the article it states that ""No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.

The atmosphere in space is so thick it almost has a 97 percent of carbon dioxide which is like a blanket on venus. ",2
34fd610,"My position on driverless cars is that they should not be apart of our future because of the negative aspects they bring. With these cars there may be a couple of positive things such as being more flexible then buses, but the negative side wins. In order for us to have driverless cars we are going to have to spend some serious money. As well as spendng all this money we don't even know if these cars are safe enough. Finally, is a driverless car if a human still has to be able to take control?

First of all, none of the tax payers are going to want to pay for these smart roads like talked about in the article. In the late 1950s they tested a car to run on a special test track, and although it worked it had a lot of expencive moving parts. Another question we have to answer is are these cars safe? Google says their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, yet it still has trouble pulling in and out of driveways. That's not the only thing either they also has a diffuclt time dealing with complicated traffic issues.

Finally, why would you want a driverless car if you still have to driver the care? They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but the human needs to stay alert the whole in-case the road ahead needs the human to navigate through work zones and around accidents. Although it lets you know when they need you to take the wheel, it watches make sure you sre always paying attention. And when the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver. In the case of the driver wouldn't they just get bored waiting on their turn to drive the car.

People can keep designing cars that are ""driverless"" but until they can do everything a human can do they aren't driverless. They would also have to get states to make it legal to test computer-driven cars, let alone be able to sell them to people in their states. The laws would have to change in order to cover liability in case of an accident. Like stated in the article if the technology fails and someone is injured then who's fault is it the driver or the manufacturer?",3

ce2c085,""" The Electoral College is a process, not a place."" retorted by the Office of the Federal Register. The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers. The main reason it was established was because it was a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and electing the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College is a timely and outdated process that consists of selecting the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Yes, the Electoral College has helped the United States of America but it has also caused us many major conflicts that no citizen can change. Many Americans are not heard and by demolishing the Electoral College and bringing our ""old friend"" popular vote back in majority of Americans will be heard. This is a free country right? Do we have the right to be heard and vote for ourselves? I strongly believe we do. I vehemetly feel that the United States of America should use popular vote due to the fact Electors can turn sides, in reality voters are not even voting for the President they're voting for the electors, and there is often a major conflict also known as the ""disaster factor"".

""...electors could always defy the will of the people."" Stated by author, Bradford Plumer.  Once Electors are voted for they have our trust and votes in the center of their palms. They could either listen to the people or break our trust. Majority of times more than 15% of electors turn sides and vote for the opposing party. In a survey taken in 2000 more than 60% voted for popular vote by citizens because they were unwilling to put they're vote in the electors hands. Looking at the correct statistics don't you believe it's only fair to the American people that we use popular vote? More than half of America believes it is only right to use popular vote. What about the other half? Well, thinking about the situation, in the end, they will still get what they want and what is needed. But the real question here is, what do you think?

Lets take a quick look at reality here! When voting for the President of the United States of America you are technically voting for electoral votes. Majority of America does not realize that because of the Electoral College you are voting for their votes. As an citizen of the United States we have the freedom to speak and vote for whoever we want. When voting we are basically putting our votes in the hands of the electors so if sides are turned doesn't that basically mean our freedoms/rights are being violated? I advocatly believe it does and the only way we could possibly fix it is by establising popular vote. So why are we waisting time?

Last but never least, popular vote should be established because almost every four years the Electoral college runs into major problems whether sides being turned on or just the system running low. Believe it or not voting is not supposed to be such a chaotic process. Assertions are made with not much basis which causes majority of the problems we face. If we get rid of the Electoral college entirely all the conflicts will vanish. Our founding father would be proud to know that we got rid of the system that was giving America major  problems even if we much appriciate our founding fathers.

In conclusion, I vehemetly feel that the United states of America should use popular vote due to the fact Electors can turn sides, in reality voters are not even voting for the president they are voting for the electors, and there is often a major conflict also known as "" disaster factors"".

aa79930,"Can you imagine in the future where you see floating cars and cars driving with no one in them? I can not, because I believe cars where a bad idea from the beginning. Why use cars for transportation when you have your own two feet? Driverless cars are a bad idea because they give human beings reasons to not get out of their house, they can cause accidents, and the cost to make driverless cars will be too expensive.

Driverless cars will make the human population obese and ignorant. It will cause people to not communicate with others. For example, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. By 2020, driverless cars will be the big hit and everybody will want one. They can pick up their kids from school; go get groceries whenever they need, so the parents will not have to walk around the grocery store for so long; eventually it will be able to anything you want it too. Without the daily driving and walking we do, the human race will soon become fat.

What happens if a driverless car causes an accident? If there are no humans in the car but your car is totaled, how will you change car information? How will you talk to the other person to see whos fault it is at? How would your car drive home if its been in an accident? Driverless cars can not do everything.

The cost to make driverless cars is going to expensive. Where do you expect to get the money to make these cars? For example, they need a whole lot of sensors; cameras to watch that the driver is remaining focused; and the most important bit of technology in the driverless car is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings. All this fancy technology has to come out of someones pocket. Who's pocket do you think the goverment will take it out of? You are correct, the American's pockets. All our hard earned cash going to a car that we do not even need.

Remember America, driverless cars are useless and not needed in the society we have today. Driverless cars are a bad idea because they give human beings reasons to not get out of their house, they can cause accidents, and the cost to make driverless cars will be too expensive. ",4
9dfcfb9,"The electoral college is our countries way of voting, but we need to change that and what i mean by that is that i think we need to have our voting system on the peoples popular vote, for many reasons first off, easy to comprehend you dont have to be nervous and accedently vote on someone different you can obviously see who your voting on. secondly, president can win just by popular vote and not worry about the electoral college votes.

To start off, the electoral college is confusing when i first learned about it i could barely understand, but when your voting on a president you dont have to worry about voting on the wrong person because you vote and your states vote is different. also when you vote by poular vote you chboose who you want to be president and not worrying about your states vote. also theyr'e aren't any hassels involved like understanding how the electoral college works. also the vote that you cast can not be who you wanted due to the elctoral college because you cast a vote on the electors and they vote which isn't fair to the people because they could vote for someone toltally different then what you wanted.

In addition, the nominees for president now can get popular vote and still loose which isn't fair to the people and the nominee because he can get tricked and the people do to which is cruel. also if if i was a nominee i would wrather win by a popular vote becacuse it means the people get to vote for who they wanted instead of a elector and it means the people really wanted me as a president so it shows that they wanted me and that i win by there election vote. now instead of that we have a system to where i could be running and get popular vote and loose which is cruel and unright to the people cause it means they wanted me.

To conclude, the elctoral college is our countries way of voting but i would wrather have the president win by popular vote because first, easy to comprehend and you get who you wanted to vote for. secondly, you dont have to worry about winning popular vote then loose cause you didn't win electoral vote.         ",3

There are many planets in the outer space, but we can't see and examine details about those planets if we don't have people go out there and do it. Although, it is hard to try and study a planet when the atmosphere and evironment won't let you. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depite the dangers.

The author supported this idea that studying Venus was worth the dangers the planet presented. Venus is an dangerous planet to examine. The temperature, and atmosphere is dangerous and more extreme than what we encounter on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface than any other planet in space. Venus is the only planet that is like Earth in some ways. Humans have sent several spacecrafts to land on Venus, and none of them have survived.

a9215f1,"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

Dear state senator we should get rid of the Electoral College for many reasons.

One reason is that small states do not get any attention from the upcoming presidents because their electoral votes for the small states are to small like Alaska only has 3 electoral votes unlike California which has 55 electoral votes so the upcoming presidents can just not even think about the small states and go for bigger states like Florida, Texas, and California.

People say ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" and Bob Dole said ""Abolish the electoral college."" Many things can go wrong in the electoral college like their can be a tie in the sytem where is would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

Another reason is what some people call the disaster factor, consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. who would vote for some one to not listen to them and do what they want? then the electoral college is useless in the sense of voting for who you want.

3358e08,"In everyday life people's emotions can affect certain things they are doing, like listening to or watching something. This is also the case in a classroom at school. Typically when a student is portraying positive emotions they will be more interested in the lesson and therefore pay more attention. The opposite goes for negative emotions, if a student is for example sad or worried they will be less interested in the lesson and pay less attention. Now if a teacher were able to detect when a student is portraying negative emotions, which is now possible with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), that could be very valuable, because it could make the classroom a better and more affective learning environment.

First of all if FACS was to be used in the classroom it could help teachers and instructors know whether or not a student is telling the truth about something based off of facial features. According to the article FACS can ""even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This means that if a teacher asks a student if they are doing okay and they smile back and say that everything is fine, even though it is not fine for them, FACS would be able to pick this up and notify the teacher so that they could help the student.

Secondly students already don't like going to school but, when they have to come to school and sit through boring lessons it makes things worse. Now teachers usually try to do their best to make the lectures as fun as possible in order for the students to stay engaged. This sometimes does not work out though and the teacher may not even realize it, but Dr. Huang predicts that FACS ""could recognise when a student is confused or bored."" With that the teacher could change what they are doing in the lesson to make it more engaging and therefore help students learn better.

So in conclusion, FACS would be valuable in a classroom environment, because it could help teachers be more affective with their lessons and get students the help they need to succeed at school and later on in life. This new technology is just one of the many new and incredible things technology is capable of and with the continuation of these discoveries we can strive to make the world a more positive, safe and liveable place.",3
3fa57a6,"In 1976, NASA discovered a land formation that looks like a face and since then it has become a national icon. Conspiracy theorists think that we at NASA are hiding something. They think it was created by aliens. We know that it wasn't though because after all we're the experts here. If we were hiding something, why wouldn't we release it to make more money? We have technology and the smarts to prove people wrong that think it was created by an alien. The conspiracy theorists are wrong.

As better technology is developed and our images take on a higher resolution we have proof that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a land formation with an odd shadow. In 1976, we first discovered the ""Face on Mars"" using the Viking 1, but we couldnt really tell what it was because the resolution wasn't that good. Then in 1998, the technology developed over the span of 22 years, the resolution became better, and we could sort of tell what it was. Then in 2001, we really discovered what it was because the technology was way bettter and we could see a 3D image of it. As technology developed we could really start to tell that it was in fact a mesa. Proving that the people were wrong and that they don't have as advanced technology as we do.

The conspiracy theorists were once again wrong. They just look off of the images NASA puts out and think of the most bizzare theory and release it. When we had the MGS fly over Cydonia (where the ""Face on Mars"" is located) on April 5, 1998, he snapped pictures and really discovered it wasn't an alien formation. Then, many people disagreed with our logic again and said that since it was a cloudy time in April '98 on mars, that the alien markings were hidden by haze. We then went for a second run on April 8, 2001, ""a cloudless summer day"" and captured the photo using the the camera's maximum resolution, and still didn't see any alien markings. They were yet again wrong and this proves that it isn't an alien formation.

In the end, the picture really shows a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. These landforms are much like the ones we see on Earth. They're common on almost every planet. What Garvin says is completely true, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These formations are just another land formation. The people who thought they were alien markings are just trying to get attention.

After all, we at NASA have always had the best technology to look into space and at other planets. People have tried to prove us wrong and we always come out on top of things. We've proven them wrong with images, other formations on Earth that are equivalent to formations on Mars, and the knowledge that we have. The people shouldn't question it because if it really was an alien marking we'd share it with the public. These theories that it's an alien marking are wrong and we've proven this.          ",4

This leaves the smaller states' existence to be controlled by the larger states, to the dismay of the American economy and people.

As it stands, most states vote in a way that presents a united front of electors to the electoral college. If just over half of the Californian voters vote for one candidate that they think would represent their interests, the map in source 3 shows that all 55 electors will present their votes to the college. It is better for California to be represented in this way so that the Californian economy would not be adversely effected by their minority voters. That sort of united front is beneficial to every state in the union, for the same reason.

The argument that the electoral college discourages voters of the minority party to vote is a valid criticism, but it is a problem that can be solved without the loss of the electoral college. Compulsory voting would be far more effective if voter turnout is an issue. People who would not have voted otherwise would still likely vote for the candidate they supported if voting was made mandatory.

In source 2, Bradford Plumer expressed dissatisfaction with the way political campaigns involving the electoral college focus on swing states rather than allowing equal debate in all states, but that does not make for a less desirable outcome. Dissolving the electoral college would make swing states irrelevant to presidential elections, as it'd be impossible to win votes in those states by any decent margin. Instead, campaigns would focus on the areas in which they already have an agreeable population, as to encourage them to vote, and get the most voters possible, using their resources. Trying to win states, rather than population, allows for voters to be more informed.

The electoral college might not be the best potential method for presidential elections. It is, however, far more desirable for such a large country than popular vote. Popular vote would lead to neglecting many areas of the economy that are important, but do not have a presence in states with large populations. It would make elections more one sided for each state at the same time. The problems the opponents say abolishing it would fix, would be fixed without it, but doing so would create far more problems than it solved. It is also easy enough to fix the same problems without abolishing the electoral college.    ",5
7e1bf39,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to students in a classroom.The system can be really beneficial. For example, in paragraph six it says, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts."" Most people may suggest that the system might be false or that there is no way to read emotions with tehnology but there is a way. In paragraph three it states that the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, using all 44 major muscles in the face.

There is different technology used to ensure that the outcome emotion is correct. For example, video imagery tracks the facial movements and each expression is compared to a neutral face. In paragraph three it says Psychologists, Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS, has classified six basic emotions: happiness,surprise,anger,disgust, fear, and sadness. It can be helpful when trying to see if students are actually learning or are just staring at the words, not retaining anything. Dr. Huang predicts that if the system can recognize if you are bored or confused then it will be able to modify lessons to make the student interested again. Therefore, making a better leaning experience for the students.

In conclusion the FACS is beneficial and valuable to students in classrooms. By using video imagery the system can track the facial expressions could determine whether a student is confused or bored. ",2

I have a couple of reasons why it is worthy pursuit and a few reasons why it isn't a worth pursuit, but I will stick to the reaons why it is a worthy pursuit. There are many reasons and challenges of leaving our own planet to go visit and explore another planet, but with the right midset and will power anything is possible.

A couple of reasons why it would be a worthy pursuit to go to Venus is because it could show us what Earth will look like if we keep abusing our planet. The reason I say this is because in paragraph 3 it states that the atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide. This really popped out to me because people on Earth are saying global warming and the main reason of that is carbon dioxide from cars. Another reason this would be a worthy pursuit is that scientist can study the planet with their own eyes. The reason that would bepossible is that because NASA had an idea that we have a blimp like object be about 30 miles or so above the ground and scientist would be able to study what a planet like our own cold end up like.

In conclusion, if this decision was up to me I would find a way to send scientist to Venus to study it. I also feel like this would help make a change in the way we live our lives to help prevent something like this to happen to our own planet.",3
8850e39,"The old question has finally been answered, ""Was Mona Lisa happy or was she just trying to trick her audience to think that she was."" Now, thanks to technology, we are able to figure out how she actually felt. With hard work and coding computers will be able to tell how people are genuinely feeling. This technology will help in schools, working environments and more, people will be able to tell if someone is feeling upset, depressed, happy, bored or content.

In relation to Mona Lisa, the article explains that she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This shows that the computer is advanced enough to identify emotions of a woman from many centries ago. Due to the study of human anatomy the computer is able classify emotions like ""happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness."" With normal identification skills if there was a mix of them people could tell exactly how others felt. For instance if someone got 68% sadness, 22% angry and 10% fear, then people could tell that the person needed help, or was not fine like they said they were. If computers with this technology were in schools teachers would be able to tell if there student were okay. Most students say there okay but with this technology we would be able to perceive if people need help or theorpy. It could change the world by helping prevent less suidcides and self harm or peer pressure and bad decisions. Although it seems this technology could only be in sci-fi movies, the article explains that ""It's all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" Even so, with human persection we can not read or figure out everything from people by what they say and how they look but with the extra help from technology we can get even closer. Nick D'Alto confirms that ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politican or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Yes people have study this for a long time but the computer is just as capable without as much time. The computer reads peoples faces by creating a model and comparing it to the same persons face with no emotion and uses knowledge of the face muscles to determine one's emotions.

However, this technology could also do simple things within a class room like tell if a student is confused or bored or tired. In addition to this information from students schools can find what makes students want to get their education and can get them to enjoy and understand it at the same time. Nick D'Alto claims that ""Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modiy the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Accordingly, with teachers and technology working together it could improve schools for students and teachers.

With this technology it could help overall morality and acedimics within classes. It could also help human communication, and get people and computers to work together more than before.     ",4

What if the car crashes and will not allow you to get out of the car before it blows up? Driverless cars are dangerous because you dont know what will happen once you're in a machines control.

Smart cars are not able to pull in or out of driveways, dealing with traffic, working their way through roadwork or even an accidents. Driving in and out a driveway is easy but a smart car is unable to do such a thing. A smart car has techology that i is a spinning sensor on the top called Dubbed LIDAR. that uses lasers to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars around it. So it should be able to pull in and out of driveways and also be able to coraperate in traffic.

Another example is what is a super smart hacker or terrorist hacks into the smart cars system and start creating crashes. Even if the Google cofounder Sergey creates a safe enough password someone will find a way to crack the code. There are lives at steak with these driverless cars. What if someone had a enemy decides to hack into their car, and drives them off a cliff. who will be responsable Google cofounder Sercey.

e026f3c,"Space is always going to be a mystery to us. We will never be able to explore all of our universe. However, we can stil hold hope that maybe there are other life forms out in space. So when ""The Face"" was found on Mars in the region Cydonia, many people were shocked, especially the public! Many people think that ""The Face"" is real, although the images resemble landforms here on Earth, the images show it is a landform, and scientists have checked the image and conclude that it is just another landform. This is why the face on Mars is just a natural landform.

Have you ever found a small object around your house and wondered; What is this thing? So you compare it to other household objects and find that it resembles something you have. This is exactly what scientists have done with ""The Face"". They weren't sure what it was exactly, but after careful evaluation, they found it looks just like a butte or a mesa- landforms that are found in the American West. This is why ""The Face"" is just a landform, because it is exactly like a bunch of landforms found lots of places. In the text it says, ""'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'"" This statement shows how the Face is a replica of landforms on Earth, and how it is nothing more than that. These reasons show how the Face is nothing more than a ordinary, dull landform found on Mars.

Imagine this. You are about to look through a microscope to observe a piece of grass. Now without the microscope, you see an ordinary, green weed. However, when you take a look at the grass with a microscope, you can see all of the cells, and pigments, and structures that make the grass appear the way it does. Scientists have taken these exact steps in order to classify the Face for what it is, which is a landform. The images show the face is just a natural landform. Without a careful evaluation, the image looks like a real face. Likewise, when scientists went and examined the Face with a careful observation, they found that the shadows, and angles, and structures of the landform all made it appear as a face. In the passage it states, ""The caption noted a 'huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'"" This piece from the article stands to show that images prove the Face is a landform. Agree or disagree with me, the proof is in the pudding.

I know many people who want to point out others flaws, yet are blind to their own. I know any people who strut around boasting how wise, glorious, and flat-out amazing they are, but have nothing to show for all of their talk. I am sure you know atleast one person like this: we all do. However, when a rocket scientist tells you a picture of a Face is a landform, and has proof to back it up, chances are you will agree with them because you know they are wise and capable of finding the right answer. This is why the Face is just a landform, not only can scientists walk the walk, but they can talk the talk! They have evidence that shows the Face is a landform, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument afterall."" Stements like this can be believed becasue they are coming from intelligent people who know what they are talking about.

Whereas I know that the Face is just a landform, many people think ""the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" While I can agree that a huge discovery like this might want to be kept a secret for a while in order to figure out what the next step would be, why would you not trust somebody who has an enormous amount of intelligence? Are you a rocket scientist? No. So why doubt one when they tell you that they have examined the Face and found it is nothing more than a landform?

The Face on Mars is a natural landform. Scientists have compareed it to other landforms on Earth, checked the images which show it is a landform, and scientists all agree that it is, in fact, a natural landform. Many people want to keep their hope alive by suggesting NASA wants to keep the actual evidence a secret, but at the end of the day, who know more? You or a Rocket Scientist? I think we both know the answer. Now, we might find aliens in the future, but for now we are yet to have any company in Space.           ",6

Sounds great, sounds real futuristic, but I just know those things can't be successful anytime soon. Personally, I would love to ride in a driverless car one day but that's a huge risk to take.

To start off with, a driverless car does sound prety cool. I mean it coulld introduce so many oppurtunities for the world that we've never seen yet. A driverless car could be the start of something new. Like Google cofounder Serge Brin believes, such cars could change the world fundamentally.

In counterclaim to that, THERE WILL NEVER BE A COMPLETELY DRIVERLESS CAR! Well, at least that's how I see it. I mean a driverless car, I know it's 2016, but that's going past the limits. It's all pure imagination if someone believes a driverless car will be accepted into the streets of the world.

There's only one HUGE reason I say it won't happen though... A driverless car will never be safe enough to count on. I mean be real, would you ride in a plane wth no pilot with only computed sensors telling you what's going on around your plane? What's going to happen if one of those sensors on the car don't react one time? Like I know everyone has had a surprise mishap with a computer-generated system before. Think if your car caught a virus or something or just was being used too much, your on the road, then our car starts going crazy and drives off the road. Who's fault will it be? What if someone gets hurt because of your car, not you or the car's manufacturer, but your car?

In conclusion to all this, I think it's a brilliant idea to have. It definitely presents many arguments, but I wouldn't be in a driverless car even if it was my only choice. I wouldn't want my life in the hands of a technological device or machine or whatever it'd be called. ",3

The computer can tell the teacher if the student is having a difficult time understanding. The teacher inturn can give help to the student as its needed.

As this day and age of the technology countines the teachers are not going to be able to realie on the students to ask questions. This is where the program will come into play. For the students that keep trying the questons and dont ask questions or the students that just sit there and are mad about something and there not working. The teacher can look on there computer and realize etheir they dont know what there doing or if their getting mad from keep trying the problems and not getting them correct. So in this case they can hopefully stop the issue before it gets out of hand or give the student help when nessacary. When you look at your freind or teacher that you now there facial experestions. You can often tell if something is wrong. This new program will take this idea that we use and turn it into a way for teachers to help students in the class room setting. There is also no way to cheat this program as it takes a 3-D model of your facial muscles and with this said. There's a sertain type of look you give when you nervous so the teacher can ask whats wrong.

This is a great program for the teachers all around. For them to be able to tell if you need help without asking.

60a385e,"The Face on Mars is not a legitimate face or a creation of aliens. Conspiracy theorists seem to think it really is. The landform is comparable to the multitude or butte or mesa landforms found here on Earth. The picture taken in 2001 has three times the pixels sizes compared to the pixels in '76, also if this Martian landform was indeed crafted by aliens it would benefit NASA a lot.

The Face on Mars can be compared to the lot of landforms in the Western America. One scientists, Garvin, recalled ""it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River in the Snake RIver Plain of Idaho."" This can also be a reminder of other landforms, such as the Appilachian Mountain or Old Faithful- the water geyser at Yosemite National Park. In Cydonia, there are also quite a few odd landforms. The Face is just another one of the many unexplainable formations on Mars.

The day the picture of the Face was taken, the people in the spacecraft had to go through many misty clouds. That day was a cloudy day on Mars. The picture taken had three times the pixels than the picture taken in April of 1998.The picture was clearer and one could see that the shadows that creates the parts

of the face are just only shadows. The only unusual thing about it was that it looked ""like an Egyptian Pharoh.""

The main reason conspiracy theorists would believe the Face in an alien craft is because it is an unusual landform. NASA scientists wanted more attention toward Mars and they wish there really was an Ancient Martian colony. It would benefit NASA and its funding.

One now can come to the conclusion that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. The Martian landform is quite similar to the ones found in western America. The original picture taken in '76 had less pixels making the picture appear odd, and if this was a formation created by aliens, NASA would use it as a benefit.",3

The passage also states that ""Astronomers are fasinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system"". It is evident that the author is trying to suggest that studying venus is a worthy persuit despite the dsangers it presents because scientists and NASA want to try to find a way on the planet without touching it dangerous ground. NASA has come of with an ""idea"" as such as having hovering cars or a ""blimp-like' vehicle hovering over venus for closer obsevations.

In addition f the author feel as though the scientists should not continue to do these expiriments or the test visits because of all the dangers and the safety risks of trying to get inform on Venus. According to the passage, the temputure can get to a high of 800 Degrees or More!, and the atmosphere has a 97% blankets of cabon dioxide covering it.

035e589,"Have you ever gtten your hopes up for something special, but you secretly knew you wouldn't get what you wanted? That is how some felt once they discovered the ""Face on Mars"" wasn't actually a face. Many convincing facts led NASA's employees to believe this natural landform was actually a human face. However, there just so happened to be a few more facts and pieces of evidence to tell otherwise.

In September of 1997, Cydonia became NASA's number one priority when Mars Global Surveyor arrived to the Red Planet. The article says this was eighteen long years after the Vikings missions ended. Jim Garvin explaines how they felt this landform was important to taxpayers and they photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. Beacause this mysterious form exsited and NASA payed so much attention to it, it shows that they only used solid facts to explain how this landform was created naturally and not by aliens.

It was not until Apri 5, 1998, a year after Cydonia became their priority, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, as stated in the article. It also says Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture which was ten time sharper than the original Viking photos. This comes to show that NASA did not just go off one photo taken eighteen years before hand. Eager web surfers were anxious to find out something juicy, such as alien life form on Mars, but to their surprise the Face had occured naturally.

The web surfers and many other people were not satisfied with the outcome and were not going to give up on their hopes, but neither was NASA. The critics said how the ""Face on Mars"" is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was cloudy on Mars when the photo was taken. NASA then prepared to look again. Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew in closer for a second time. Garvin stated, ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of veiw."" The pixels in the most recent pictures taken spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixels in the best 1976 Viking photo. Garvin also adds how you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. This means that it is the clearest image you could take and if there just so happened to be things such as airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks the picture could have clearly captured them.

Although many wanted to believe the Face was anything but a natural landform, NASA used strong facts and evidence to fight the arguement and convince people otherwise. I strongly believe The Face on Mars is natural and was not created otherwise because they used all facts and has three different pictures one of which could have spotted things other than the landform, but did not. Nothing but the truth was caught on camera and that is that the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing but a natural landform, and nothing more.               ",4

Using technology to know whether an individual is upset, happy, mad, etc. could be used as an improvement on our daily lives. According to the article, they tested this new technology on the famous Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting and defined that ""she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" The outcomes from this new technology system could actually be legit and can tell us what people feel. This new sofware can also help the people that are to afriad to express their feelings or don't know how to .

Sense there are some individuals who hid their feelings and aren't that easy to read their emotions by just looking at their facial expressions, by using this system you could read and even track their face movments and even their mixed emotions also. For instance, as stated in the passage ""Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"".""Using imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" This new software can help those who have a ""neutral face"" and show no emotion.

Facial expressions aren't always going to reveal how an individual is actually feeling or what emotions he is going through inside. For example, in the article it indicates that the Mona Lisa is ""9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"", even though in the painting she looks 100 percent happy. This software will read off your emotions no matter what face expression you are making. Many of us can use this software to figure out what others are feeling when they are to scared to tell others how they feel. For instance, if someone is feeling really upset and has a neutral face and you can't tell that they are upset, you can't help them unless you know how they are feeling.

Teachers can use expressions from their students to know what they are doing right or wrong. It saves a lot of time so that the kids can enjoy learning, and not get bored, tired, or confused because of it.",3
db534ee,"Prof. Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe collaborated to innovate a computer software called the ""Facial Action Decoding Sytem"", which recognizes facial emotions. The software can construct a 3-D model of the face and is programmed to recognize specific traits. Basic emotions such as happiness, surprise, anger, fear, and sadness can all be detected, as well as a mix of them all. This innovation has the potential to be revolutionary if placed in a classroom.

Many emotions are portrayed by students every day, and they can be a key factor in student effort. For example, a tired and bored student is more likely to lose focus and be less attentive than a well-rested and pleased student. The Facial Action Decoding System has the abillity to detect boredom. Dr. Huang stated , ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" He sees the educational benefits to students if his software were used in a classroom. Students would be able to stay focused longer and continue to do so without boredom. A happy student would be much more willing to learn with a software that kept them focused and happy.

With the Facial Action Decoding System in a school, or at home on a PC, everyday computer activities will get more and more interesting. For example, digital advertisements are just about everywhere nowadays, and some of them can be annoying an even disturbing. However Huang's software can process the facial reaction of a user to determine which adds to allow them to see. ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar as might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different,"" Huang predicted. Putting a software with the abillity to do this would benefit students and teachers. Ad's can pop up in school that may not be appropriate or have anything to do with a desired subject. If the reaction of the student teaching that subject is negative, the ad will not be seen again. On the other hand, a teacher could find an ad that would benefit a lecture or teaching segment, and more educational ads will appear.

Others claim that the idea of a software that constantly watches a student's face is bizzare. They claim that humans can already detect when something is wrong with a student, or if they arent participating well. While humans can observe a student's emotions, it is not as precise as Huang's software. Given that some may be feeling well but prefer a calm and relaxed demeanor, humans will not know what these students are feeling at the time. However, the software will use all of the facial muscles to determine how these students really feel emotionally.

Huang and Sebe's Facial Action Decoding System truly demonstrates how facial motions can show mental feeling. This is why it would be extremely beneficial to have in schools. Students and teachers would get to experience a fully customized day at school based on their emotions for that day. This will eliminate loss of focus and amplify participation, which is crucial for all student succes.",4
ce8a5b9,"The Mona Lisa's mood was never really made out to be one emotion.Looking at this painting would have anyone confused as to what was running through he r mind at that exact moment or what was going on around her.Leonardo da Vinci captured what seems to be a smirk or even a face of mixed emotions.

The Mona Lisa is known for having a multi-expression face,but in this day in age it can be determined by people all over the world exactly what she felt in that exact moment. ""She's 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry...It's the subject of Leonardo di Vinci's Renaissance painting,Mona Lisa--at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions."" With this new amazing software it will be easier to read people and use this to analyze different types of people.

This advanced technology works much like us.""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' everyday.For instance,you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face''. Not only can this new tech help with human expressions,but this software can also help with education. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor."" This new discovery can help the avarage student through a stressful and confusing class meaning grades would go up and students would be more succsesful in their acadimic career.

Finally,this technology can change the education world and everything else for the better.Making everything easier and stressless to the world.",3
1d580b3,"The Face? Created by Aliens or just a landmark?

Did you beieve that the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" was just created by aliens. NASA has given us many reasons to believe what they say, and not many reasons for us not believe them. I am a NASA researcher and I'm telling you why the ""Face"" is actually just a landmark.

There are many reasons why the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" is a natural land form. The first reason is that NASA took three different pictures, one picture was in 1976 in the picture you can't really see anything. Scientists just thought it was another Matian mesa. At this time the cameras weren't very 3D like. So how do we know it's an actual face?

The seacond reason it is a landform is because NASA

sent another crew to take more pictures of the ""face."" The crew took ten pictures that were sharper than the first one in 1976. In this picture you start to see something appear. They even say ""when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. People were not very happy when they heard it wasn't a alien monument.

Another reason is that they thought alien markings were being hazed. So, when they went back it was a cloudless summer. In the text they say ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. That is a huge difference from 1976. What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa.

If you really think about it though, how come they jumped to conclusions so fast? In the passage it says it would be a good way to engage the public to Mars. Wouldn't it just attract more people to NASA to though?

In many ways there are more reasons to why this ""Face"" is more of a landmark than anything. From the different years they took the years, to the landmarks being hazed. You could probably think of a lot of questions to ask NASA about the photos and what the scientists are saying, but until you go up to Mars we will only know what they are telling us. Which is that the ""face"" is a mesa. They clearly say many times in the passage for people to believe that they are not trying to trick you.  ",4

ab888fe,"Is this technology that is able to read students' emotional expressions valuable?

I think the value of using this technology to read the students' emotions is really important. It is important because you can determain if students show some sort of depression in there life and you can be able to help them prevent suicide. "" A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This would help the teacher be able to help students out or try to teach them in a different way so it doesn't seem so bored or confusing.

This new technology can help in so many different ways. Us oursleves may or may not see how another person is feeling, we might think they are feeling happy but deep inside they can be sad.

d871f4e,"Electoral college... what a compromise! the electoral college should be removed and replaced by the popular vote for the president because our votes don't really count and the electors are not always fair.

In the passage it had said ""you help choose your state's electors when you vote for the president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate electors."" This means our votes are not really counting. The state electors are the ones who are actually selecting the president for us. Candidates don't spend time in states that they have no chance of winning. Putting the fate of presidency in the hands of a few swing votes is rediculous. The electoral college is irrational and doesn't show much of reality. Some people tend to lose interest in the president's because of the way they feel about their votes. Thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election and vote directly instead for representitives to do so. People have refused to vote for party candidates and wan't to cast a vote for whomever they please. There are over sixty percent of people that would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now.

Another reason why electoral college should get replaced is because it is not fair sometimes. ""can voters control whom their electors vote for? not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? sometimes."" This is the disater factor, it is hardly expected to reflect on the will of the people. A large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than small states do. At times a presidents can have more popular votes and the other less fewer electoral votes and the one with the popular votes lose and that only happened once. In run off elections if people know that their vote will not have an effect and think its unfair than they have less incentive to pay attention to any compaign than they would if the president were picked by popular votes. Potential voters will turn off the electoral method if they know a candidate has not hope of building up their state.

That is why electoral votes should be replaced with popular votes for the president because most of the time our votes do not count and it is unfair to us.    ",4
63213be,"Evening Star, this nickname is misleading since Venus is actually a planet. Venus is the second planet from our sun. As Earth’s “twin,” Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance.

Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus’s atmosphere. On the planet’s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

The author wants us knowing why we cant land on venus or why venus is so great to learn about, we can learn so much about it and why scientest are so amazed about it. They have a theroy that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

Even though, Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions.   ",1
585045b,"Attention my fellow citizens, we should limit car usage  because limiting car usage will release stress, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, and stop smog.

First, we should limit car usage because driving a car can be stressful. For example say you just got finished with a hard day of work and it was not the best day, You hop in your car and when you start to drive you look ahead and see a trafic jam. After working all day, getting in a car to wait hours and hours to get home is not peaceful or fun. Another example would be when you're on the road and the people around you are not driving safely. ""When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happeir this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two.(In geram suburb life goes on, paragraph 3)

Not only does the usage of cars cause stress but it also causes greenhouse gas. The use of cars should be limitted because we could drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (In geram suburb life goes on, paragraph 5) Using a car to get around is nice but isint living on earth better than driving a gas powered vehicle and slowly destroying the earth? ""All of our development since World War II has been on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transport for America.(P7)

Finally, We should limit the usage of cars because if we do we can stop smog. Smog is pollution that creates clouds all around and it is discusting and horrible for the earth. 'Bejing, China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.""(Paris bans driving due to smog, Paragraph 14) After intensifying smog, congestion was down 60 percent and thats only after 5 days thats incredible!

All in all, we should limit car usage because if we can use cars less than we do, it will ease stress, reduce greenhouse gas, and finally clean the earth. What do you say, use your car less and get some exersize? Thanks for reading my fellow citizens.    ",4
1dbfc26,"Imagine the ability to percieve every single emotion of another person, recieved in short and direct percentiles. This will now be possible thanks to the latest innovation in software development by Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe. This new computer software will be able to contruct a 3-D model of one's face and analyize major facial muscules and the emotions that they convey. This is used along with FACS, Facial Action Coding System, which codifies the facial features into the six basic emotions of happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. All of this information is complied and then you reviece results. This techonology has been predicted to assist students in classrooms who struggle with a certain lesson. Doctor Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This does seem promising, but I propose that this techonology would not be as beneifical as it seems and will only further alienate our society, end up being only used to make profit, and exasterbate stimatization of mental disorders and 'wrong emotions'.

Today we are blessed with technologies science fiction of the past could not even dream of and yet we are still faced with the same psychological neurosis of the past. On a large scale technology has seemed to exasturbate this problem, we are lonely, we are guilty about the past and anxious about the future. Before we would do anything to be liked by our peers, but now we will do anything to be liked by the thousands of blank profiles on social media. This does not diminish the adcances in science, computers, and the now easy access to information we have but technology always brings with it amazing powers but also terrible consequences and we must use it responsibly, In the artile ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, it says ""In face, we humans perform this same impressive calulation every day. For instance you can tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Our human brains are just as powerful as the machines we create. We do not need artificial software to bring us together we only need to encourage and foster a society of empathy and compassion. The use of this emotion-recognition technology in classrooms would not be effective if teachers and instuctors are not already avaliable to address such issues as demotivation, boredom, and more extreme cases of mental disorders. We can make genuine connections in the real world to solve these problems instead of expensive new technology. Schools may not be able to even afford them, but others might.

Others might use this techonology for less admirable means than classroom disinterest. The article states other uses, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This does not seem as nefarious if you do not think of the further consequenses. Privacy is becoming a scarce commodity in the twenty-first century, as I type this companies and corporations are making money selling my (and your) personal information to thrid-parties. In today's society, money is the sole drive for success. This type of emotion-recognition software would be less likely to be used in classrooms and more likely to be used to sell more stuff.

In conclusion, this techonology could only be used in a regulated and safe environment in order for it to be effective. The consequenses of this technology would be an increased of alienation and the malpractice of this technology. One day this technology might become widespread but before than happens it is even more important for one to address the societal impact technology has already had on us and foster a society of compassion where this technolohy would thrive.

89718a5,"In Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D' Alto, the technology used to determine what emotions people feel by using pictures of the face is a valuable tool that can be used in classrooms to make schools all over the world better for everyone. The facial emotion detection technology is useful because, the software could use pictures of students faces to let the teacher know who is confused, who understands and who is bored.

The facial emotion technology will allow teachers who have confused students to better learn by letting the teacher know that students are struggling so that the teacher can help the students on a more one to one level. This technology allows students who are normally scared to ask questions or that are very shy to not drop behind the rest of the class when they do not understand what is going on.

The emotion detection technology can help the teacher know when the class as a whole understands a subject so that they can teach in a more efficient way. The technology is helpful because, it lets the teacher know when to move on from one subject or problem to another. This is more efficient because, If a problem is understood by the class then the teacher may not even bother asking for a solution to the problem which, saves time for more important subjects or, gives more time to areas where more students are struggling.

The emotional detection software can let the teacher know when the class is bored and when they are interested in the subject, this is helpful because, the teacher can learn; how the class as a whole learns best, how to teach in a way that gets students attention and, get everyone in the class the best and most enjoyable education the teacher is able to provide.

In conclusion, In Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D' Alto the technology that was able to determine the emotions of Mona lisa the famous paining is helpful in the classroom because; It lets teachers know when students are falling behind, how to be more a more efficient classroom and how to provide the students with a more enjoyable and useful education.

fc4379f,"Cars, they make life so much easier, or, do they make them deadlier? The amount of green house gasses has increaced dramaticly over the past years, due to the gasses emitted through the tallpipes of cars. However, there has been ways that people are trying to lower these gasses. People around the world are reducing the use of cars for a more cleaner form of transportation. In Vauban, Germany residents in this community ""have givin up their cars""(1). Also in Paris where they ""enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air""(10). While in Bogota, Colombia they have a car free day to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog""(20). These cities are pioneers in the way of a cleaner form of travel.

The first step is to just have a day without cars, like a new holiday. In Bogota, thats just what they have. On this day ""millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work""(20), and those who didn't were fined. This reduces not only smog but the stress of driving and the business of traffic jams. On one of these car-free days, even though it was raining the spirits of the people didn't dampen. Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, said ""these people are generating a revolutionary change and [that it] is crossing borders""(26), when he visited Bogota. As a result of these days ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restrants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up""(28).

Another way that the car-free idea is shaking up is in Paris, France. On a Monday ""motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home""(11), if they didnt they would recieve a 22-euro fine. There smog riviled Beijing, ""known as one of the most polluted cities in the world""(14). Hovever, after only one day, ""the smog cleared enough [on Monday that] the ruling French party [rescinded] the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday""(19).

The biggest leap, however, would be a town with no cars. Vauban, Germany is a community where ""street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden""(2). The streets are filled with ""the swish of bicyles and the chatter of wandering children""(3) instead of motors and horns. This expirimental town has sparked a new way of life; a cleaner, safer way of life.

We have gone on thousands of years without cars, and after they were introduced they polluted the air and caused us stress. So if we could go on without them before, then why can't we now. As demostraighted by Paris, Bogota and Vauban life isn't that bad without a wheel to sit behind.    ",4
84df41b,"The Face is a natural landform, and we have proof that shows it such as several pictures taken, one clearer than the next. The brightest photo and the examination of the Face tell us there are no aliens on this planet.

Firstly, when NASA got the first picture, I concede that it looked somewhat alien-like, however, that was a huge misunderstanding. A more closely taken picture shows that it is, in fact, a natural landform. I know this because when the picture was taken, there was no alien monument. Therefore, no aliens, right? But the wispy clouds that were there when this picture was taken, envoke skeptics. A third picture silences them.

Secondly, once the skies above Cydonia (the place on Mars where the face is) are cleared, they go in for the third picture of the face. This picture proves to be the of the best quality. Stated in in the text, it reads, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo.""

Proving this photo to be the most accurate. And when they examine the photo,it shows that the picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, common landforms in the American west. Garin then says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

With the clearest pictures taken, we can all see that the planet of mars has no aliens, for the Face is a natural landform. Yes, people will believe what they will, but the examinations, and the clear pictures prove that the Face is close to a butte or mesa, common landforms found in the American West.",3

in the night sky. Venus is the second planet in the solar system and it is nearby Earth and Mars and they were the planetary neighbor. Humans have sent in Venus to discover

the planet Venus. Since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Numerous factor contributes to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for human to study. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide. Even more challenging clouds of highly corrosivesulfuric acid in Venus, On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degree and the atmospheric pressure is 90. This planet Venus is a challenging place to go for the astronouts.

Long ago Venus was probably covered with oceans and it could have various form of life, just like Earth.The planet has a surface of rocky sediment including familiar feature like valley, mountains and craters. The value of returning seems indisputable. The NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to studu the Venus. NASA has probably a solution of how can they float above the fray. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus.Electronis made of silicon carbide have been tested in chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface.

This is not easy conditions, but survival for humans. Sriving to meet the chllenge presented by Venus has a value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the plane itself.

9cf0187,"""HONK! BEEP BEEP!."" ""Hey! What are you doing!? You're causing a traffic jam!"" What causes a traffic jam? Cars. They get us from point A to B for sure but, do we really need to rely on them that often? I don't think so. As we limit our car usage, the air pollution lowers, fewer car accidents happens, and road rage? Gone.

Limiting car usage have many benitfits, such as the air pollution lowers. In some countries, for example Paris, they ban driving due to smog. fter near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city. As of that Monday, they would fine motorists with even-numbered license plates a 22-euro fine($31). The effect of this was that public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday.

In Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians participated in a car-free day leaving the streets traffic jam free. It was their third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted. It didn't stop people from participating even though gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said a businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bike with his wife. This campaign began back in the mid-1990s. Without cars, parks and sports centers have bloomed throughtout the city. They even fixed the uneven pitted sidewalks and replaced them with smooth sidewalks. A city of 7 million, rush hour have dramatically cut traffic as they have their car-free day.

As for the United States, President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies shows that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses as each year go by. Another study has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39 year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak's research has found. Without cars, people are expected to walk more and car pool with friends or take buses. This will dramatically decrease greenhouse gas and air pollution. In Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Moter Company, has laid out a bussiness plan where they create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and impove safety.

In conclusion, by not driving a car, air pollution lowers, fewer car accidents happen, and no traffic jams. From different sources, different effects happens when cars are banned. In Paris, smog is a thing in the past, no traffic jam for a city of 7 million in Bogota, and in Barcelona, public transportations are connected and is faster to get to point A to point B. By not driving cars, we won't cause car accidents and it will improve safety for everyone. Walking never cause problems and can get you anywhere.    ",2

The very first servere danger, the author explains is in paragraph three as they get into the specifis of the sulfuric atmosphere as stated "" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"" this line shows that this dangerously corrosive gas creates a huge problem for the space program NASA.

The next neighboring issue is also the extreme blazes of heat that come from the planet Venus itself show in paragraph three "" On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit"".

3ab4c11,"The face is not created by aliens and here are a few reasons why. It was a mesa, or maybe even a shadow. but aliens is not a logical reason for this face to exisist on mars.

First, A mesa, a mesa is a very common landform found around the American West. Even so there is one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, USA. Which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars. If something on the earth can have a mesa about or the same height had the face on mars it is very likely that it was a mesa.

Secondly, shadows We all knows that shadows can be very deceiving just like in this instance. A shadow could have been reflecting off the viking 1 while it was taking this photo of the ""Face"", or maybe the shadows were from a bigger land form. that was infront, behind, or on the sides casting a shadow onto this mesa.

All in all, From these facts you can conclude that this was a natural landform and not some type of alien thing. If you still do not believe that it was natural. Another spaceship went into space and found the ""Face"" and took a very detailed picture and there were no markings or signs of aliens.               ",3

I would be for driverless cars because i think that the pros of the driverless cars would outshine the cons of it. When it comes to technology there are always going to be negative and positive outcomes to things its just about how much more positive than negative it is.

As stated in the artical it would be very useful to prevent accidents and help drivers that arent in full control of there vehicle yet to learn how to better drive on the road. The rear veiw cameras that have been made to help cars notice when they are abou to hit something is a good start to helping people that might not pay as much attention as others but it can also be negative in other ways. The traffic jam assist could be useful as well as it helps people that are stuck in traffic maybe in busy cities or on a road where an accident has occured

To conclude i think that it would be a good idea and i fully support the driverless cars while also being aware of the downsides to them and trying to work around them. It all comes down to the laws and how the government can make our streets safer for our generation now and future generations.   ",2

2a9bea8,"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because, our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. Venus had once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, this keeps astronomers fascinated. People are intrested in the topic that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.

The author states in paragraph 2 ""Often reffered to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally closest in distance too."" Despite the dangers Venus has, It is 'Earth's Twin' we could learn a lot about Venus and Earth if we decide to study the planet more. Scientists believe we say that Venus is Earth's twin because it once was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth does today.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is in the midst of finding other ways to get nearer and study Venus. These Astronomers are aware of all the dangers of getting to close to this planet and all the affects that come with studying up close. But for them to truly understand what comes with Venus, they will take the risk. ",2
ea37dc6,"The author suggets that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus may have once been the most Earth-like planet, NASA wants to know more about the surface, and it willl give us a reason for new technology innovations.

Astronomers believe that Venus may once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" article it states in paragraph 4, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Venus is known to have a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

NASA came up with an idea for sending humans to Venus since all previous missions were unmanned. No spaceship has survived the landing for more than a few hours. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. In paragraph 5 it states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" When the scientists are floating about the fray thirty-plus miles about the surface, the temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. NASA says, ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" If NASA's idea succeeds we could send scientists up there to float above the fray.

Not only is NASA working on the idea of floating about the fray, NASA is testing some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that stimulates the chaos of Venus's surface and has lasted for three weeks in such conditions. NASA is also testing mechanical computers that played an important role during World War ll. In paragraph 7 is states, ""These deviced make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all."" Modern computers are powerful flexible, and quick, but tend to be more deilcate when it come the the extreme physical conditons like Venus' surface.

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despte the dangers it presents. Studying Venus will give us more information about the once most Earth-like planet in our solar system, we will find out more about the extreme surface conditions, and will provide us with many technology innovations and advancements.

Even though kids would not like it it should be brought to use because there can't be anymore drepression into kids life.

First reason why I think we should use technology like this is because it says that, ""even though individuals often shwo varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly."" This means that if we start using this type of technology we can figure out if a person is good or bad. Another reason why we should use this technology is because it says, ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait taht conveys happy, worried, etc."" This could mean that even if you might know what they feel you could most possilbe be wrong because if they look happy that does not mean they are actually happy they could be sad in the inside of their body. Then finally my last reason is they used the Mona Lisa smile as a demonstration. Then it said, ""The Mona Lisa demonstartion is really intended to bring a smile to your face... Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" This means this technology can detect if you are actually happy or sad.

In conclusion, I agree with this kind of technology because it can help people understanding other people's feelings. It could also demonstration how fast time is going by technology. Also, what technology can do nowadays.   ",2
2523ddd,"Have you seen or heard about the Face on Mars. You probably have on its been starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazinesw, radio talk shows, even in grocery store checkouts lines for 25 years! NASA is researching this closely. The Face is just a natural landform because how would aliens make a face in the middle of Mars? Why would they? In Mars there's all sort of natural landforms so who knows?

How would aliens make a face in Mars? Why? I don't know either its kind of seems impossible. Aliens might have step on it to make it look like a Face but they would have made it on purpose. To me it does look like an Egyptian Pharaoh but back then they were barely finding out what Mars was or didn't even know about Mars. On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over to Cydonia they took pictures then times sharper than the original pictures, then when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing it was a natural landform. There was no alien manument after all.

In Mars theres all sort of natural landforms created by Mars weather that makes landforms look cool and interesting. When NASA send viking 1 it was circling the planet getting phtos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Thats when NASA started reseaching it. In April 5, 1998, it was proven that it was just natural landform. Through the years the face starts cracking and fading away because of the weather. The weather of Mars is usually unpredictable, but usually cold. Also the wind in Mars is pretty commen and it makes the land look like a lot of weird things!

So Mars makes all type of natural landforms and why would aliens make a face in Mars? How? I dont know either. Its all of about Mars weather that makes this natural landforms, but its mostly the wind. It looks like an Egyption Pharoah but later on it starts disappearing because of the conditions of Mars. So don't let those ""unrealistic"" aliens trick you.           ",3
d00eb06,"in the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" It talks about driveless cars and how it postive and negative to the cars. I think the postives side put up a good argument but I honest have to side with the negative becasue its aruments are what seem right to me.

Well like it stated in the article that who's to blame when something bad happends that's excatly why there shouldn't be cars like that. If there is then then we wouldn't know who to blame any more because if we keep on casusing accident's and we go to court and man gets blamed for the fault of the manufacturer. Then the man who was balemed in the first place can sue or something like that for getting blamed because of the manufacturers fault. But sitll theres no one to blame that what its comes down to when we really think about it.

Even if the got safety features i think its a pretty ingnorant idea to make a drive less car becasue were not perfect either way. So if we make these cars there would be no accidents, yeah right were are no perfect so these cars can never be perfection. So when we try out these cars frist time we might be like its nice nit having to drive when drving litteraly putting your foot down and streing come on people are we that lazy that we can't even do anything for are selfs anymore even if we could take control sometimes with the driveless cars it doesn't mean all the time so yeah america's really lazy we can't even put are foot down and turn a stering wheel to drive anymore wow america thanks.

Either way these are the reason why i don't think is a good idea to have drives less cars because there's no one to blame if someone gets hurt driving or getting hit by the car and that its just really lazy of us to even think of drivng as a hassle but i guess some people do so yeah but either way drive less cars are point less.

5bcf9b0,"I think that we should keep the Electoral College but we could also change election by popular vote because there could be problems over the outcome of an Electoral College, the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. A candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. Voters in toss-up are more likely to pay close intention to the campaign, knowing that they are going to decide the election. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast. It also restores some weight in the political balance. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.

Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electoral. Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. Your states Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. Voters can expect close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Under the electoral college system, voters don't vote for the president, but for electors, who in turn elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. The person who picks the electors in the first place depends on the state.

The argument against the electoral college is what we might call disaster factor. If there is a tie in the electoral vote, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one vote. the electoral college is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, they only focus on the right races in the swing states. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote the party's nominee, but it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Elecotral college is widely regarded as an person or a thing that seems to belong to the past and not to fit in the present, it's a non- demogratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receive most popular votes the winner.

So i think we should keep electoral college because it's a process not a place. ""The founding faters established it in the constitution as compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens"" (Source 1 paragraph 1).

Posner, the authors of the article discuss the pros and cons to having an electoral college. The citizens of the United States would be more pleased if the electoral college stayed as opposed to it being ebolished.

To begin, having a electoral college will be better for the nation and people.

for example, the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a president"" the article states ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is very possible- it happened in 2000- but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" this claim provides a true statement on reasons why we should keep the electoral college. This statement means that disputes are less likely with their method and their is a certainty of an outcome.

Although keeping the electoral college is a valid idea, there are some problems associated with keeping the electoral college as well. Of course, there are difficulties with in the curcumstsance where we keep the Electoral Collage opposed to disspose of it. the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, Plumer made several claims opposing of the electoralcollege, such claims include ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters"" and opinons like ""Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irration"". While Plumer did put his point across as to how the system is unfair we must take into consideration how it is more reasonable and appropriate, in ""in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" the article states that ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal"" which is fair and less stressful.

in summary, the best option would to keep the way things are rather than changing things up and and creating a more stressful, unorganized system. Although Plumer made accurate claims as to some of the faults in the system, there was far more proof in keeping the electoral college and keeping things the same.                                                    ",3

Dr. Eckman has classified 6 basic emotions: happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. He has studies how those emotions contract with human facial muscle movement. Using video imagery the system will monitor the face. Making it universial to anyone that uses it. The software can identify mixed emotions. For example the Mono-Lisa 93% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. It is similiar to the calculations we perform everyday such as telling how someone is feeling by the look on his/her facial expression.

This would be tremendously beneficial for students because it can adapt a lesson particularly for that exact student. Making the class lesson more intersenting and benefical for the student to remember and retain what they just learned in the lesson. Also within the system it can detect a fake smile due to a different muscles being used. It could also be very benefical on students in medical school. It would benefical for them because it can make animated faces more expressive in video surgery. Humans mostly have communication that is nonverbal including emotion communicatio, and this would be a great way for doctors to study it.

The use of Facial Action Coding System could do tremendous things in human psychological research. It can help adapt a amazing classroom lesson made custom to the student only. Also it can truely detect peoples emotions by reading the muscle movement in the human facial anatomy. This could help cure depression, and anexity related issues. I think that the Facial Action Coding System could work, and I believe it should be reasearched on more.   ",3
071bcae,"Studying venus is a amazing purduit because no human could not live in venus or go up to venus because its far away from earth and we haven't made a spaceship that could reach all the way up in venus because it could never make it. Another stuff you can be finding for venus is the clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus. And on the planet;s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure in 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

These facts that you can research are very true because you could go up there and find out all theses stuff and these facts support my claim because you can research cool stuff about Venus and that other people didn't know about and thats how it supports my claim.

And thisw concludes all the stuff in my essay if Venus is a worthy pursuit to study about Yes i think it is because you could be learning more than others about Venus.",1
e1aa1f6,"The value of using technology to read students' emotional expressions is an outstanding idea . The new software , the Facial Action Coding System , can help you understand everyone's emotions around us. This new software , has been develped to detect the feelings of others without them announcing their emotions .

In Mona Lisa's picture she looks happy and angry . The text states , ""She's 83 percent happy , 9 percent disgusted , 6 percent fearful , and 2 percent angry"" . With the computer software you can use video imagery to recognize facial movements . The software can identify mixed emotions and and any neutral expressions . For example , most humans wear their emotions on their sleeves , but most humans can't describe each facial trait . The facial expressions on each emotions aren't always very universal , individuals often express their emotions in different degrees . Dr . Huang states , ""Most human communication is nonverbal , including emotional communication"" . There are ways to demostrate emotions through computers too . Computers can become an effective human instructor if they recognize the different emotions .

In conclusion , the technology usage of ""The Facial Action Coding System"" is a great usage of technology to read students emotional expressions because it will allow us to have empathy for eachother . We unconsciously imitate eachother's facial expressions . We could all help eachother in the world , and talk out our feelings instead of holding it in .      ",2

It is a huge rock formation because mars has lots of rocks.How can their be aliens but there is any other aliens around. Their is no earth like subtance on mars no plants no nothing.

If we just think about it mars is located 41 degrees north MGS had to go through the wispy clouds just to see the face. I had to talk to Garvin about this and he said ""it is not easy to target Cydonia"". He had also said ""it will take hard work"". We explain that the planet like a machine in narrow2.5km-wide strips.

On image 3 times bigger than th pixel size. There is no ufo markeing not even foot prints. If the did have them you would see what was there. If it was acctually not a martain it was butte or messa. We see those to alot in the American west.

It is very hot on mars it could be fromed because of the volcaneo. It is crazy because we have the same figure on earth. So how can it be a alienit is nothing but rocks. pluse why are we focuseing on that one so called alien we should look around mars and see if there is any more.

Does it look like and alien or a rock you tell me. If you listen to what I say you will believe that it is a rock. If it is a alien should mars be a life plant like earth.",2
29c2511,"I am against driverless cars, because it could dangerous. Like it said in paragraph eight ""wouldn't drivers get bored waiting on their turn to drive?"" The answer is yes the driver would get bored. Once the driver got bored he or she could potentally take their eyes off of the road. If he or she did take his or her eyes off of the road and the car didn't detect something that needed to be handled by the actual driver things could become extreamly dangerous.

Another thing that could be potentally dangerous is what if the driverless car malfunctions and the actual driver didn't know? In the passage in paragraph two it says ""google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" It also says "" their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" Although they haven't had a crash yet it could happen. And when it does happen who is to blame?

In paragraph nine there is a really good question. It says "" if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" If you were to answer the question of who is at fault many would say the driver is at fault, but others would say that the manufacturer is at fault in this situation. In my opion both would be at fault. Why you may ask, because it was both of their faults. The manufacturer might not have checked everything before he or she sent it off to be bought. The driver is at fault here too because he or she might not have been paying attention to his or her surroundings. In the passage in many paragraphs it says that the driver could take control. If the driver was paying attention he or she could have possibly prevented the accident. In colclusion that is why I am against dreverless cars.",3

He also gives information about how diffrent metals and other objects melt and liquefy after so long on Venuses surface.

They give very good information on how NASA plans to get peopel to Venus by building a space craft that will hover 30 miles over the landscape of Venus. He gives muliple good facts about the spaace craft and how it will possible work. The author claims it will work like airplanes and a blimp, However it will still be hot 30 miles up. It will still be 170 degrees up there.They also give you the bad parts of having a hover craft over Venus for example the visibility of the landscapes and terrian. They also explain how you can't take samples from the ground hovering 30 miles over the land.

The author also gives creat detail of Venuses surface and how NASA has been thinking of diffrent ways to approach it. They give facts about the ground and the atmospherer around Venus and how the Atmosperic pressure is 90 times greatewr then we have experience with.The author also tells us how it's blanketed with 97 percent Carbon diocide and other gasses. We are even told that the conditions are to extream for us and how the presure would crush a submarine.

The author also adds on how hard Venus is to examine with all the storms and comotion on its ground.

Venus even has volcanoes that erupt on it's surface. It has Earthquakes and even occasional lightning storms. The author has definetly done a very good job on explaining his point on exploring Venus.

84dd02a,"This strange figure that took the shape of a face on Mars is actually just a natural landform. It looks much like a landform equivalent to a butte or mesa which are common in the American west. shadows around give the illusion to the eyes that this strange figure has eyes, a mouth, and a nose.

Proof has been found from high tech cameras that shows that this is just a landform and was not created by aliens. After we found the what seemed to be alien markings we decided to look again. Its has the same height as some natural landforms like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. If they was anything that could have left a mark by aliens we would've been able to see it.

You can dipect the size of something in a photo 3 time larger in real life. So if there was anything on Mars that shows aliens were there than we would definately be able to see it, but there is none so that leads us to the conclusion that this odd looking figure is just a natural landform and not built by anybody.

To conclude my arguement on whether or not this strange looking figure is actually made by extraterrestrials or just there by nature I belive this is just a natural landform. There is proof and that it was not made by aliens and none that shows aliens made this figure. We used our best equipment to find an answer by research and strongly belive in our answer. There are no markings of aliens of any sort on Mars that could have built this figure. There is an illusion that this shape is in the shape of a face, but isnt really.

20e2d04,"Way back when the only way you could get around is by walking or riding a horse. They didn't have cars back then, they never even thought about getting around by driving. Back then you didn't have to worry about gas prices or anything like that. In this generation everyone think's the only way they can get where they want to go is by driving a car,when that really isn't the case.

Driving in this generation can be fun, but can also cause a lot of disadvantages. Cars can be very dangerous and cause a lot of damage in this world. Right when you get in your car and start driving around you are poluting the air. There's so pollution in this world and cars are making it worse. The world use to be clean before cars came around cars are taking over people and their lives.

Cars cause a lot of accidents. Every second of everyday there is an accident and people are loosing their lives because of it. People don't take driving seriously at all. If we didn't have cars there would be no accidents happening. No one would be driving under the influnce and having to worry about getting in the car and driving home. If we all walked we would be getting our excercise and not have to worry about loosing a life.

I think we should go a week without driving a car and see how everyone likes it. Yes, the sidewalks will be packed but when you drive you have to deal with traffic. Another thing is that you don't have to worry about wasting your money on gas. I think this world would be a better place with less cars and more walking.    ",2
111c03c,"I think the driverless car is becoming a little to not interesting becasue it clearly says that the car still alerts the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues and they said that the car can only navigate it's self on clear road.

The driverless Cars is basically reffering to the story because people who dont got arms or legs im pretty sure they would want to drive with having to backup in and out of the drive way and not having to worry about being alerted to start driving because a so called smart car cant navigate it self through traffic you might as well drive a regular car and thats like us on a clear road and we just put our stuff on cruise control.

I really do not think this car is safe at any kind of way but i see where they are coming from but it just makes no sense to have car that cant do certain stuff to get through and i also think if its smart enough to switch lanes and stuff by its self than i think it should be smart enough

to get through traffic accidents and it definetely should be able to pull into a simple drive through and even if they was to sell the car it would cost to much only the rich could buy it.

I like the idea i really do but i wont be driving it anytime soon you never know whats going to happened to them self controlled cars espiecally if it runs off of electronic signs and stuff like that but maybe im wrong and it may turn out the greatest car ever invented in the world and eventuslly make millions of dollars but thats jusgt my opinion and my solution of the strory.

Whats the point of having a driveless car when you have to be in it while driving that absolutely makes no apart since at all.",2
8e65ded,"In ""The Challange of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents. The author defends his idea by stating that Venus is like Earth in ways such as its size and density, current landscape, and the environment Venus possibly housed in the past.

One way that the author thinks that Venus should be furher explored is that Venus is how similar Venus' terrain is to Earth's. Currently Venus has valleys, mountains, and craters atop a surface of rocky sediment like Earth. Theoretically in the past Venus' surface was covered witn large oceans for the most part. These conditions made it possible for life forms to grow there.

Another piece of information used is that despite the dangers on Venus expeditions can both be safely carried out and fruitful. Various technologies are being created and innovated for Venus' harsh environments. In the cirsumstance that scientists are stationed at Venus they will be equipped with blimp-like vehicles so that they may envade the storms that are near ground level. Even with these safer ways of navigation collecting material data such as rock or gas would not be possible. Another solution to this problem has been intoduced. Simple electronics made out of silicon carbide have been tested in simulation spaces similar to Venus' comditions and environment. Scientists are also proposing that mechanical computer are used to collect dataon Venus. These computers are much more hardy then their modern-day cousins.

In conclusion with these innovations the author belives that Venus' exploration would be a worthwhile puruit despite the challanges becuase obviously a large amount of information can be found there. Not to mention there are solutions to some of the problems that would arise while exploring Venus. ",4
1ccd84e,"Cars have become an essential part of everyday life.

They allow people to bring themselves from point A to point B in a substantially less amount of time than just walking, running, or biking.

They have allowed us to travel parts of the world that were previously out of reach.

Although they help us do all of these everyday tasks, there are many downfalls to driving them ourselves.

Human error when driving a car has caused many severe accidents and deaths.

This has influenced us to create a new method of travel where we wouldn't have to even install a steering wheel.

Driverless cars are not as far into the future as we believe and they are potentially a great solution to the high death rate of drivers and their families around the world.

Currently, the level of fuel consumption is very high.

There are so many people burning fossil fuels that we are actually causing global warming.

While driverless cars will not solve that problem completely, they will greatly reduce the rate at which we burn fossil fuels.

Paragraph 1 of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" clearly states that we will only burn half the amount of what we are currently burning of our fossil fuel supply.

This could give us time to produce a new solution to completely rid the Earth of fossil fuel usage.

The burning of the ozone layer threatens the existence of our species and all life on Earth.

It is one of our greatest threats.

With driverless cars, comes the lack of human error in our current transprtation system.

By allowing machinery of this kind to take over, we could potentially eliminate a substantial amount of car accidents caused by distraction and inexperience, thus lowering the death rate.

Manually driven vehicles are also very expensive to purchase.

Most people only lease their cars which is also very expensive.

By replacing these cars with driverless cars, you would pay much less money to travel than you would to lease or buy a car.

By eliminating this expence, you are allowing people to save more of their hard-earned money which will improve the quality of life for everyone.

Today, we have such a huge problem with fuel consumption and pollution that people in some highly populated areas are forced to wear masks outside so they don't breathe in the smog.

This problem is mainly the result of the number of automobiles in use.

People are also dying in automobile related accidents every day.

When cars posses the capability to communicate with eachother about their position on the road, accidents ahead, or road work in progress, they will greatly reduce your chances of being injured in an accident.

Driverless cars are a huge step into the future and should be seen as a positive advancement to today's technology and a great way to stay safe on the road.",4
2289ad8,"In the article provided called ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes to us how there is new technology being developed that can identify human emotions. This technolofy called the Facial Action Coding System, like us will be able to make the same ""calculation' we do to tell if our friends are happy, sad mad, etc. Now this computer software stores anatomical informationn as if it were a electronic code. Many have thought that since this technonology enables computers to read human emotions; why not put it in a classroom setting where it can teach a whole group instuction and modify the lesson once theres a sign of confussion in a child's facial expression. I personally beleive that this software should be included in clasrooms for various reasons.

For starters the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable for the classroom setting because like I stated before if there is even a slight sign of confusion the new technology will be able to pick it up and improve to find a way for the student to coprehend the material. While the system uses video imagery the emotion-recognition software tracks all these facial movements in a real time face or in any image. Just imagine a computer being able to tell when you smile at a lesson plan because it's easy to coperhend; futhermore, the system will tr to find similar lessons plans like the one you were sown for next time.Now if you dislike it and frown the computer will take notice and the lesson plan will be diffrent next time.

Another reason we should have the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms is because many children in this generation are either to shy to ask questions to the instuctors or just scared that they will e made fun of. SInce the student is to scared or just simply to shy to ask a question he or she will not be able to understand the topic; however, with the system in the computer the student wouldnt even need to raise their hand in doubt because the technology already detected his or her confussion and is finding a solution as soon as possible.

Last but not least most human communication is nonverbal, dont you agree? I think its time for computers to understand that to. Since the computer can detect emotions without hearing anything spoken it will be able to detect if the students are happy with the lesson plan, confused with it, or just not like it. All with one look at the students faces. This hencing adapting and improving more quickly so students can learn the material and suceed.

So can you imagine not having those long boring talks teachers give or actually understanding what they are trying to get you to comperhend? All your classroom problem will be solved with the Facial Action Coding System which will help you learn much faster and efficently; therefor, setting you on the path to sucesses.",4
3d9d8bf,"In my opinion I think that it is a good idea formanufacturers to develop smarter cars for the future. Creating smarter cars helps reduce accidents due to the improvements that would be added to the cars. They also allow driving to be more earsier for everyone. Lastly, new and develeoped cars make driving more interesting and fun.

Creating smarter cars helps reduce accidents due to the improvements that would be added to the newly developed cars. Google has had cars that could drive by themselves for more than half a million milles and without crashing.

In the article it said, ""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone"", which indicates that the cars are being specially made to help out drivers be able to drive better and safer. These improvements would help a lot drivers such as adding cameras to the cars so they can monitor the drivers and make sure they are paying attention. There are many reckless drivers that do not pay attention to the road and use their phones, these improvements would help save lives. If the cars would be able to: steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, the car would be able to drive safer than a person who is constanatly on their phonethat could cause a accident. Also GM developed driver's seats that vibrate when a vehicle is in danger of backing into an object.

If we allow manufacturers to develop better cars they would make driving so easier. These cars are able to handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph. These cars are made to not only help the driver but it aslo makes sure that the driver is paying attetnion so they know when to take over. These cars are made to the point where they are almost driverless. They are capable of steering, accelerating, and they are also able to brake themselves. These developed cars make driving easier because they notify the driver when there are work zones or accidents. I understand they are not capable to driving thru these occurances but since they notify the driver it helps them plan out a different route that could save them time.

Lastly, the development of

cars would make driving more interesting and fun. Many people imagine the future with flying cars and very high tech cars. We should take advantage that technology is allowing these dreams to come alive. It would be very interesting to see cars that are able tio drive themselves without human use. Some developers, such as the Google cofounder Sergey Brin, are envisioning the future with better transportation. Sergey forsees that there would be cars that would use less fuel and offer far more flexiblity than a bus. I would find it very astonishing to see a car like that. Being able to sit in the driver seat and just let your car drive on its own would be amazing to experience. You could be eating or talk on the phone without any concern because your car is driving as safely as it can. It would be very cool to be able to experience all these technological developments.

In conclusion, I think its a great idea to let manufacturers devlop these cars. These cars would help out on reducing accidents. It would also allow driving to be more safe because you have a smart develpoment that allows th ecar to drive on its own. Lastly, these cars would be such an amazing experience for the future. We have to let technology and manufacturers with new ideas do its thing if we actually want to see all of our envisions in the future. The future would be so much better, easier, and more fun if we allow the develpoment of these cars.    ",4
66c512f,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus

There are so many things that i didnt know about venus that im learing by reading this paper so it is worthy.""each previous mission was unnamed,and for a good reason becuse not single spaseship has landed it venus""this was a real good information that make me want to know why it can never make it to venus even though it not far from earth.a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankeys venus.

The author has really grat supporting fact on studying venus is a worthy persuit dipite its dangers.",2
9b873c2,"In the article, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. The author explains why throughout the article, and tries to persuade readers into thinking that Venus is a planet we should not give up on. But the question still remains, why are scientist still researching this planet if it's so dangerous?

In paragraph one, the author explains that Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. This may bring an interest to astronomers and stargazers that enjoy studying and watching the sky at night. This may be a worthy cause for some people to continue studying Venus. In paragraph two, the author explains how Venus is sometimes referred to as ""Earth's twin"". Venus is almost the same size and density of Earth and it also close in distance. Some people may find this interesting because people on Earth are always looking for other forms of life and other places to go besides Earth. If Venus is like Earth, in physical and other ways, there may be life on Venus that we haven't discovered yet.

One of the most important things to know is that Venus once could have been the most Earth-like planet in the entire solar system. I believe that this information is very important and more people should keep studying that. In paragraph four it says that Venus ""was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" If it held life back then, why wouldn't it now? If Venus was once like Earth why couldn't Earth be like Venus now? Some people may worry that Earth will turn out like Venus, with high temperatures and crazy atmospheric pressures. If scientists and astronomers find more information about this planet, we could have almost every answer we need for all our questions.

Traveling to Venus is a very difficult and dangerous process. In the article the author states that NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has an idea for sending people from Earth to study the planet, Venus. They are trying to create a vehicle that hovers the planet instead of going directly on the surface of Venus. NASA is also working on different methods of studying Venus besides the hovering vehicles. They made some ""simplified electronics made of silicon carbide,"" and they have been tested in a lab. If they are able to find a way to Venus, they will be able to find out so much more information about it.

They also went back and are trying an old techology called ""mechanical computers."" The mechanical computers were used in the 1940s during World War ll. I believe that using old technology may be a good thing for some people and a positive thing to look at. Some people look at technology nowadays and believe it is a bad thing, but if we are using older technology from a different generation people might think different of it. Also, as stated in the article, modern technology is very quick and efficient, but do not come to much use in extreme conditions. For example, if you put a modern day cellphone or laptop in a very hot condition , it will most likely melt because of the material used to make it. If we used older technology, the technology would be made by different materials and could come more in handy.

I think this may be another reason to keep exploring Venus because you could create so much technology and invent ways to go to Venus succcessfully. You could also find new ways to explore other planets and go to other planets. Creating this technology would lead to many great discoveries about our planets and our solar system. In paragraph 7 it mentions that they could build mechanical parts that can be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. If these parts of made, there may be a benefit to the scientists and every day people. These products can be made around the world and can be a benefit to everyday society.

In my opinion, I do believe that going to Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. You could find out many new things, see new things, and learn new things. I think that scientists and astronauts have a good idea of how to do it and I think they will eventually go to Venus one day, or at least figure out a lot about it. People on Earth should take risks and be able to expand their knowledge about the world and about the other planets in the solar system, besides Earth. ",4
a6038b5,"The author feels that further studys on Venus are dangerous but worth the time and effort. In this passage he discribes the conditions and states the challenges that come with the exploration of Venus

Venus, our lovely ""Evening Star"" or our ""Sister planet"", sounds beaustiful doesnt it. Don't be fooled by the nicknames of this planet, have you ever heard ""Looks can be deseaving? If so you shoud keep that in mind when you are thinking about Venus. Venus is the second planet from the sun but

has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in the entire solar system, even with Mercury being the closest to the sun. With an atmosphere of almost 97 perent carbon dioxide, and temperatures 170 degrees miles away, living there would be impossible. On the surface there are erupting valcanos, huge earthquakes, and probes that land on its surface have been reported to be shocked by lighning. Venus got the Sister planent name due to its similar dencity and size to planet earth, there also is a therey that Venus was one coveredwith oceans, rocky sediments similar to valleys and mountains and could have been obtaining

some type of life forms.

Humans are known for their curiosety, even when it could leave them dead. In order to do any further reacurch on Venus, technologys that can withstand insane amounts of heat would have to be created then tested. Scientists have yet to explore enough of Venus, it is difficult to collect rocks, dust, or gasses for any type of examination. I feel that in the future, a scientist will create a device that can help explore the surface of Venus safely amd effectively.

Reading this passage really made me interested in learning about venus, and i also feel that further exploration would be worth waiting for the correct technology. Further studies would be effective because we would know more about the mystories of space.    ",3
12cefbe,"I believe the author did a really great job on stating his idea and supports his idea very well-informed. The author includes how NASA was trying to study Venus and that NASA still try to found a way to study Venus more. The author also explain why Venus exploration is a good idea and how dangerous it can be.

NASA has been trying to study on Venus but the Venus has thick atmosphere almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide that covers the planet. So NASA uses chamber simulation close to Venus but only lated for three weeks in such condition. But they have a idea which to build spacecraft that hover above Venus atmosphere and there study it.

The exploration of Venus is well worth because Venus used to Earth-like planet long ago. The study said that long ago, Venus probably has ocean like Earth and could support kind forms of life. However today, Venus has average temperatures of 800 degree Fahrenhiet, but Venus still has similar features to Earth like mountains, valleys, and creters. It is also sometime the closet planet for planetary visit.

I believe the author makes a good points. I agree with how Venus is worth the visit even its dangers. Humans has be expolring all around the world including ocean and the moon. However, there are still things that are unexplore and Venus is one of them and it is worth it to explore. The mission of Venus exploration might bring the world togather and will inspire the children of the future.",3
8309154,"Using Facial Action Coding System technology would not be useful in a classroom due to each student learning in a different way and teachers not being able to target to each individual student's best way of learning as well as the constantly changing emotions of students.

Because teachers are not able to adjust their teaching style for each individual student, students would continue to be unhappy and bored during class and no problem would be solved. According to Dr. Huang, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" While this is true, students are taught by humans, not computers, and education is in a group setting. A teacher cannot change their lesson just because one student is bored or confused. They may be able to work with them one-on-one later, but changing how the lesson is being done can affect the ability of the other students to learn the lesson.

In younger grades, students often change emotions very quickly due to a lack of maturity and focus. For older students, they are often tired from lots of homework, sports, and early start times. With the Facial Action Coding System, negative emotions or quickly changing emotions would cause a problem in a school scene. Dr. Huang stated, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So, computers need to understand that, too.""

The facial expressions being read from a tired high school student could cause this system to be constantly trying to find a way to teach the student that he or she would enjoy, only leading to unproductivity.

Using the Facial Action Coding System in schools would cause more problems than it would solve. Students would still be in a similar setting in classes due to their teachers not being able to adjust their teaching style or lession for one specific student. Students would also lose more time for learning due to their constantly changing emotions and the software attempting to change the learning style to match them. Using the Facial Action Coding System would have a negative impact both students and their education.   ",3

To start my reasoning, you could help thousands of people. You could also have fun on your adventures sailing to all these different contries and states. As you grow you will learn more about what you are doing. You could get really cool things when your traveling too. You could even help take care of animals.

Secondly, you could do really cool things on board. You could get to watch animals, play baseball,volleyball,table-tennis touraments, fencing,boxing,reading,whitting,and games that could pass the time. All of those things Luke did on board. You can do all of those things in empty holds.

In addition, for Luke it was much more than an adventure. You have someone to look off of and to see a ture experienceof being a Seagoing Cowboy. Now you should see why Luke said it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

In concusion,I see why its so great to be a Seagoing Cowboys. The places you travel to,the people who you travel with, and the adventures. Just think of all the fun you could have on that very special boat just wondering what lies on the other side of that island and what you could learn the points are endles. So join the Seagoing Cowboys and then you could get in for sure. How you will react when you take that first step onto the next part of your life

Some of the parts to make this possible are ,''Luke could't say no. He knew it was an opportiunity of a lifetime. Paragraph 7 tells you that he lives with his aunt Katie and paragraph 8 is where i got how many things he did while he was on board and why they thought theose activities were fun. The end about how it was more than just an adventure , I got that from paragaph 9. ",3
55d00eb,"I think that ""driverless"" cars are very dangerous. The driver could get too comfortable and fall asleep at the wheel, the car doesn't drive comepletly by it's self so you could not pay attention and get into a wreck, or you could get in trouble with the law because you hit another car or even a person.

I would think that these driverless cars are dangerous because the car could mess up and get into a wreck or hit a pedestrian and you would have to be charged because its the law. You would have to pay attention at all times no matter what because you never know what is going to happen. The driver could get tired waiting on their turn to drive and fall asleep. These cars can also accelarate and brake without the control of the driver so the car could speed and you would get a ticket for speeding, or the car could brake and cause the car behind you to wreck into you.

I think that driverless cars are dangerous because they require alot of attention. I would rather just drive myself so that I know that I would be safe and I wouldn't assume that the car can just drive by its self and get distracted by texting or talking to the people in the car. So, if you have a hard time staying awake when bored or paying attention then I wouldn't think this would be a car for you.                  ",2
2d01aef,"The Electoral College is a process in which each person running for President has his/her own group of electors who are chosen by their political party. In my opinion I believe that the Electoral College should not be kept because,it's not fair that the citizens only get to choose who is their president and who his party choose as Congress, they should  be able to choose who helps the president run the country. The President basically just signs the papers that can pass a law but the Congress helps say if the law should pass or not.

People should be able also to choose who they want in Congress beacuse, people want a Congress that they know and trust to help our country turn into a better place. Sometimes the Congress only do what they want and feel is right. The Congress that the party choose may also be people that they like and believe will follow how they feel which may not be  how the citizen feel. I know 538 pepole are alot to vote for and add the president, mayors,and commisioners etc., but atleast we'd have the freedom to pick who we want to help run country and we'd also know they'd try and help make our country amazing. Even if it's part of the Constitution they can change it a little like they alot of other things in it.

In conclusion people should be able to vote because then we'd be able to choose,so they could feel better about knowing who is passing laws and fixing their country. I may be under age but, I know if I were allowed to vote I'd want to vote for who runs my country and who helps run it.                ",1
75ad824,"This article talks about the challenges of exploring Venus , based on this article we can come up with the aidea that it's almost imposible to explore this planet because of too many factors, this planet is the closest planet to ours and NASA has been makind missions and sent many spacecrafts but non of them has survived very long, all the projects to explore this planet didn't work, that's why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.

This planet has a very thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide, and challenging clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, on this planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the almospheric pressure is 90 times greater than the atmospheric pressure in earth.

Many scientist believe that Venus have been the most Eart-like planet, long ago,Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like earth today. NASA now is working on other approaches to studying Venus. for example,some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that has been tested and lasted more than three weeks in such conditions, another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers,this devices were invented in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II.

In conclution styding Venus has been a difficult thing, and scientist have been trying too many thing to do it and they didn't work, but they will still trying until they

get more and more information of this planet. ",3
0aae146,"The Electoral College is a system which was established to elect the president of the United States of America. In this system, each state receives a group of electors. The number of electors each state is awarded is based on the representation a state has in Congress. The total number of electors per state equals the number of people a state has in the House of Representative plus the two senators a state has. In a state, the electors pledge to vote for the candidate who wins the popular vote. This system is simply unneeded in modern times and is unneccesarily complicated. The Electoral College must be abolished.

To commence, the Electoral College should be eradicated because it is simply unreliable. The result of a direct election would be more transparent and would make the citizens of this country certain the election was democratic and just. The issue lies in the fact that voters are technically only voting for electors to cast a vote for a candidate, and not for a candidate themselves. These electors pledge to vote in favor of the candidate who rightly wins the popular vote in a state, but some attempt to be defiant. For instance, according to Bradford Plumer's article, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"" (11). If the Lousiana legislature was successful in their attempt to be defiant, electoral votes would not go to Kennedy despite him winning the popular vote in that state. Another way in which the Electoral College is unreliable is that it allows for a tied vote. There are 538 electoral votes in the system currently in use, meaning it is possible for two candidates to receive 269 votes each. This may seem unlikely, but it is more likely to occur than some might think. For instance, as according to Plumer's aforementioned article, an electoral tie would have occured in 1968 if only 41,971 more votes were for the losing candidate. Additionally, in the 1976 election, if 5,559 voters in the swing state of Ohio, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had simply voted in favor of the candidate with the minority of the votes, a tie would have occured. In order to resolve a tie, the House of Representatives casts votes to decide the winner of the election. At this point, the impact of each representative is skewed so representatives of states with lower population can more easily decide the state's vote. This happens because each state only votes once, so the few representatives of a small state such as Nebraska can decide who to vote for rather easily, while in California, 55 representatives with different views must colloborate to cast a single vote. With so much unreliability, why is the outdated system of the Electoral College still in use?

Furthermore, the Electoral College must be abolished because it does not properly refelct the views of the nation. Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled ""swing states"". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion..."" (21). While it might seem reasonable for larger states to have a larger impact than smaller states, it simply isn't a fair way to go about having an election. Voters should each have the same impact, and they would have exactly that in a direct election. Presently, voters in Florida, for instance, have more impact on the election than a voter in Wyoming. Supporters also claim the focus on swing states is beneficial because residents of swing states should be more politically informed due to their state's importance in the election. This notion is simply a fabrication in order to make the Electoral College seem as if it causes America to be more informed, because there would be no need for residents of specific states to pay closer attention to candidates than residents of others if a direct election were to take place. The Electoral College does not properly reflect the desire of the nation's population, and thus should be replaced.

In retrospect, the Electoral College must be abolished. It is an inherently unfair system and it does not reflect the views of American voters.                              ",6
639d5ee,"I think driverless cars are a great idea. If you are a business man and you're busy and you need to get things ready on your way to work driverless cars could help you out, but you still need to pay attention to the road because the driverless cars need to be controlled under certain circumstances.

Although their name is a driverless vehicle a driver still needs to operate it when needed such as when there is consruction or if there is a wreck in the middle of the road so the driver needs to pay attention even if he doesn't need to drive. The car will notify the driver if the road ahead requires human skills by either telling the driver or flashing lights on the dashboard.

Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passangers, and pedestians safe. Some states think the smart car may abstruct those laws such as California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. These states won't even allow computerdriven cars be tested. I think the idea of a driverless car is great but as you can see some other people don't.",2
862fb5a,"The author shows that the idea of studying Venus is a good idea even though it is dangerous by using many details from the text. The author uses descriptive evidence and examples to show us what to expect. It is also showed in the passage that the author gives us possible solutions to our current problems. Finally, the author also gives us facts to further prove their point. So the author uses many different types of ways to show how the studying of Venus is a good idea even with the many dangers that come with it.

The author uses descriptive evidence and examples to prove their point and to give us a visual in our head to show us what they means exactly. For example, the text states, ¨A thick atmosphere of almost 97 perecent carbon dioxide blankets Venus...Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus`s atmosphere.¨ The auhtor uses adjectives like thick and highly to show us exactly whats going on, to give us a visual in our heads. The text also states, ¨...such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.¨ The auhtor is giving us an example to imagine and for us to fully understand just how dangerous this environment is. This shows that the author uses descriptive evidence to prove their point, as well as examples of just how dangerous the planet is.

Another way is, the auhthor also gives us problems and possible solutions to those problems, they use problem and solution. For example, the text states, ¨A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide...clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid....NASA`s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.¨ This evidence shows that there is a problem with how dangerous Venus`s atmosphere is, so the author then says in the paragraph after that NASA may have a solution. The text also states, ¨However peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditons...researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance...NASA is working on other approaches...simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus`s surface...¨ This shows that the author gave our problem once again about how the scientists can`t get anything done from a far, so they then continued to tell us readers how NASA is working on a new type of electronic to whitstand Venus`s surface. This shows that the author states a problem and then a solution to further prove their point.

Finally the author uses facts to prove their point. For example, the text states, ¨...some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus`s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditons¨ This evidence shows that author is showing us that this is a soultuion to a problem and in doing so they are giving us facts to prove their claim. The text also states, ¨At thrity-plus miles above the surface, tempatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit...¨ This evidence shows that yet again there is another possible solution to on of our many problems and to give better reasoning to their claim the author uses facts. This proves that the author uses facts to further encourage their point of view.

So the author uses many key ways of proving their point. They used problem solution to further their reasoning. As well as examples and descriptive eveidence to show us what exactly was happening. Finally they used facts to help persuade us that this is worth studying. That is how the author proved that studying Venus is worth it even with the risks involved.",5
4fd64c4,"Facial Action Coding Software, or FACS, is an impressive software. It has the ability to to scan someone's face, and then analyze it to come up with calculatedpercentages of said person's emotion. I believe, however, a computer with this capability has little to no value in a classroom.

First, the article does specifically state ""Your home PC cannot handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Most schools do not have anything stronger than a home PC because they cannot afford it. Next, Dr. Huang predicts ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This prediction could come true, assuming that all classrooms are devoid of any teachers.

The article also states many other jobs this program could do without replacing humans in workplaces. For instance, FACS could be used by news organizations to tell if politicians are lying or not. Another example stated in the article is using this software to select ads on the web that you will like. And finally, in paragraph 9, it says according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, that smiling may not only express emotions, but create them. The author asks ,""Did making a happy face in this experiment also make you feel slightly happier?"" On the other hand, wouldn't seeing another human make the expression cause the emotion to be a little bit more powerful, rather than having a robot tell you to?

In conclusion, because the computers needed to run the facial software are not cost effective, there are other jobs it can do without replacing teachers, and it is better to smile because you see something that makes you smile, I believe a computer software capable of reading human emotion through facial expressions has no place in a classroom.",4

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Said Heidrun Walter mother of 2, who lives in the Vauban's community. The Vauban community in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe. Bogota, Colombia have limited their car usage as well. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car free-day they have in Bogota. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode his bike to work. They've even had people come to watch the event. Like the mayor of Paraguay who said, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.""

""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shif,"" said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Dexel University. Now a days people don't need to drive somewhere to go meet people. They just use the internet, and the use of cell phones have increased in communicating with people. With these changes, people who have stopped car commuting in the United States, may find less reason to resume the habit. But in places such as New York, with new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tools reflect these new priorities. ""Pedestrian, bicyle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emmissions and improve safety.""

In conclusion, life with no cars would be beneficial. You'll be provided with better safety, and wont be as tense and alot happier than you were before. You'll be able to see what life is really all about. A better life.    ",3

Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisions and it caused Paris to ban driving for a little while due to smog, environmental conditions worsen by the day and it is apparent.

Driverless cars could change the transportation. It would make it easier to go place to place. Driverless cars could prevent accidents from occurring in everyday traffic. These cars would be much safer than a car with a reckless driver. Millions of car accidents happen every year, but driverless cars could potentially prevent most of these accidents. With a driverless car, the passengers are safer because the car is programmed to work well. If there was an emergency, someone could take the wheel and have control of the car.

Driverless cars have great potential for public transportation. Driverless cars could act like a taxi or bus system. This system of driverless cars would safe people money by not owning their own car. It would be safer to have many of these cars. Millions are killed in drunk driving accidents, and these cars would give potential drunk drivers an alternative way to get home safely.

bb2f055,"The driverless cars are dangerous and useless for people . In the article ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming,¨ the author compared both positive and negative aspects. But in my opinion, the negative aspects are far more greater than positive aspects. The bad aspects are such as the car not being completely driverless and still need to be assisted by the driver. Also, the price is going to be too expensive to be practical. That ´s why people should not buy such things as driverless cars.

First, to get in or buying driverless car is frightening. No matter how much science is devoloping today, it still can´t mimic the skill of humans. The driverless cars they are talking about here is not completely driverless. They still need assisting. According to the article, the purpose is to make people relax and help accidents rate get smaller. But how can people relax when they know nothing about what´s going on? It will only just help people grow anxiety. Also, take over when the situation comes? There is no gurantee that the drivers will be able to get adapted and know how to solve the situation right away. It doesn´t really seem to help people if this is the actual situation.

Also, the price is not going to be that cheap to be pracitical. According to the article, a lot of things are needed such as position-estimating sensors, rotating sensors, video cameras, automotive radar sensors, GPS, dubbed LIDAR, and spining sensor. All those things are needed just to be on same skill with a human behind the wheel. So the expenses are definitely not going to be average. So for normal people who live their days working and doing house chores can´t afford them. Maybe rich people will but it won´t become a hit or something that totally needed.

So people doesn´t really need the driverless cars. People don´t need a car that need people assisting when they can drive it just fine. And the money isn´t going to just fall down to earth to buy it. Maybe some people will get interested in them. But as there is no significient to be proved of, it will just be an amusement without no purpose. ",4

21e0763,"Dear Senator,

Its official, the electoral college is unfair, outdated, ans irrational.  A direct election would make it fair to most states and it wouldnt matter on the amount of electors.

The electoral college depends on the popular vote so the you are only voting for the electors not the actual canidates if you think about it.  Each states gets a certain amount of electors depending on the population of that state.  For example,

California gets 55 electors while Florida only gets 29.  So the presidents wont eben care to show up to places Alabama with only 9 electors.  They would only go to the bigger populated states and try and win their votes and not worry about the rest of the country.

If we had a direct election more of the people vote would count and it wouldnt matter about the electors in the states.  The citizens would actually be voting on the canidates.  This is a much more fair system to include everyone into and have an accurate election.

In the end, you should realize how uneccessary the electoral college is and how the direct election is a more fair way to get accurate results.  This way we would have much less issues and the elections would take place in all states and not just the ones with more electors.    ",2
c5ced33,"The electoral college is how america chooses its president. The electoral college should not be how you think voting works but the complete opposite. It is a process that consist of electors who count the electoral votes. When a citizen votes their vote does not go directly as a vote for the president but it goes for the electoral college in your state. If that state has more votes for one candidate than the other then that state votes for that for that candidate as a whole. If the person I vote for doesn't get the vote for my state then that defeats the purpose of me voting. The electoral college takes away my say in choosing a president, the fairness, and it might have been put in the Constitution by the founding fathers but it is outdated.

The first reason why the electoral college shouldn't be used is because it takes away voters say in the decision for the president. If I vote for someone and the state doesnt pick him, that would mean my vote didn't count. That means i would now mean no one would even care about my vote. My vote wont even help make it a closer race. It's like my vote just vanishes into the air and is never seen again. If there are millions in the country and only 538 votes count. This is unrational to voters.

The second reason why the electoral college shouldnt be used is because it isnt fair. It is especially unfair because of the winner take all system in each state. Candidates don't even waste time going to states they know they cant win but only focus on swing states, which for one takes away the priviledge for the others that want to vote for the candidate to see them. It also takes away from the smaller states who don't get to put out as many votes as California with 55 or Florida with 29. Alot of states only have three votes and even though it could win or lose a races it still isn't fair to the people.

The electoral college was put into the Constitution by the founding fathers but they are not always right. The Constitution says all men are created equal but we still have had slavery. The Constitution has given us freedom of speech but once we step on school property that rule is taken away. The Constitution is not always the right way to go for everything. The founding fathers were very smart men but they have to think of how the country feels now because they were alive a long time ago.

In, conclusion the electoral college should just be put out of work because it is not the best way to elect a candidate, it takes away my say in the decision,the fairness, it was made by the great founding fathers but is outdated by how the counrty is now. Everyones vote should be out into play with the elections.    ",4

This new computer would not make me smile it would make me angry. I think that they should only do it on paintings and not on real life people. I also think if they do this new computer thing a lot of people would be angry,

In conclusion, i do not like the idea of the computer where it can tell what emotions you are feeling. It is an invasion of your pricavy. Like I said before they should only do it on paintings and not on real life people. ",3
fc76be4,"germany,paris,columbia and now the usa have begun to cut back ob their vehichle emmissions. why?

To reduce the amount of greenhouse gases produced by their countries.

no cars in germany? vaubaun germany is a new upscale community on the edge of the french and swiss border. recently completed in 2006 whats so special you might ask?

theres little no no cars in this new community.

according to the article ""

in german suburb, life goes on with out cars

"" written by: elisabeth rosenthanl.

""70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here.""

thsi effort is being used to try and reduce the 12 pecent of green house gas prouced by europ alone.

in vauban people crowd the sidwalks, kis playing in the streets, and the people that do want to own a car have to pay a cool $40,000.00. and there cars are not even kept in their houses.

in another european country close by, paris is also trying to cut down its green house gas emisoms.

in the article ""

paris bans driving due to smog

"" it tells how france is also taking action to reduce its green house gases.

the article reads ""after days of near-record pollution, paris enforces a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""

anyone who had an odd numberd tag on one of the days and was cought driving would  get a $31 ticket. and revers for the even numberd tags on the next day. so the cars took turns driving. meaning there would be less cars on the street on those certain days.

according to the article over 4,000 people were fined, and 27 people had their cars impounded. it might sound stupid but whe your trying to save the world its a small price to pay.

bogota columbia also joins the fight against greenhouse gases.

""

car free day spinning into a big hit in bogota

"" by Andrew selsky tells the story of just one day that people in bogota neglected to use cars.

"" millions of colombians hiked,biked,skated, or took buses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. it was the third straight year cars have been banned and taxis permitted for the days without cars in this capital city of 7 million. the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. violators faced $25 fines.""

bogota columbia has been doing this now for over 3 years, meaning that they are actually cutting down on there green house gas emissions.

not even the rainly days of columbia stopped the participants of this now yearly event. the participants are not only held to bogota, recently cali and valledupar also joined the even.

this 1 day with out cars has been in place sinc the 1990's.

the article ""

353186c,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to get in your car and simply puch a button to get where you want to go?

Most people think that this would pleasure to have.

Not many people take into consideration all of the problems that having driverless vehicles could bring.

Having driverless behicles might seem like a dream when in reality would be a nightmare.

Most people think of driving as a relaxing activity. Not only is it a form of transportation but a stress relieving pass time.

Having driverless cars would erradicate that peace and serenity.

In paragraph 8 the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it states that, ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?

Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?""

This statement exemplifies how inconvenient it would be to have to wait around for your car to tell you when you can resume driving.

Another reason that having ""driverless"" cars would be inconvenient would be that if an accident were to occur who would be to blame.

Paragraph 9 of the article demonstrates the problem by stating, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?""

This showcases that drivereless cars would also be causing trouble after an accident.

At the time there is no way of justifying which was the cause of the accident, man or machine.

Finally, it would be expensive to build either the roads or the cars.

These cars would have to come full of sensors and indicators which can't be cheap.

The article shows this by saying, ""These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to the existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.""

Sure these driverless cars work well on the road but at what cost.

Where would the funding to build entirely new roads over the entire country come from?

These are just three of the many different inconveniences that driverless roads would bring to us.

They would take the fun out of driving, bring more trouble than there already is after accidents, and burn a hole in our wallets. This is why having driverless cars might seem like a dream but in reality would be a nightmare. ",4
59b2a7f,"Think of a clear world, no smog, no pollution, just a beautiful day everyday. Now wouldn't that be nice. What if I told you that you can make it happen? It's as easy as snapping your fingers. This thing you have to do is, drum roll please..... not using your car. I know it sounds crazy right now but let me tell you about all the good that comes out of it, and maybe, just maybe you'll change your mind.

Now as most of you know there is alot of pollution all over Earth, and this pollution is caused by alot of things, but the two main reasons are cars and power plants. Pollution caused by cars affects alot of things including greenhouses. When smoke from a car reaches a greenhouse it produces a gas that negativly affects the enviroment. Your probably thinking that it's no big deal because ""theres not alot of greenhouses"", but that's where your wrong. As Elisabeth Rosaenthal says "" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"".

Another thing that is caused by cars is smog. Robert Duffer, the writer of

Paris bans driving due to smog , wrote that "" Paris typically has more smog than other European capital ...[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found"". Congestion in France was down 60 percent after almost a week of intensifying smog. They had to stop using cars of course, but it was the only way to get the smog to go down.

Now that we've talked about the bad stuff caused by cars, let's talk about the good that can come out of not using a car as much or not at all. alot of people who participate in not using a car, weather it was for a day or for forever, have said that it reduces alot of stress and air pollution. Lower air pollution makes for more clean and clear air. Which means you get to see the day better than before, and who wouldn't want that. Overall it not only helps you, but it also helps the planet you live on, so give walking a try, you might even find seeing nature around you better than driving by it.    ",3
0f7cc68,"changing the election to popular vote would I think benefit us and this country. Whats the point on voting for the president if the electoral college is going to do it and will pick the final decision. the electoral college cinsits of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president, but what about us who vote. I feel like there is no point in voting if the whole election is based off the electoral college. This electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system that runs in each state. candidates dont spend there time in the states they have no chance in winning in, they only spend there time in the states they think they can win in. For example in 2000 17 states didnt even see the candidates at all! Some people in these 17 states didnt see one ad at all. Its not like us voters can control who there electors vote for because some voters get confused about the electors and sometimes can vote for the wrong candidate. Its not fair to us if we dont matter in this vote at all, especially when the people running dont send an ad out to every state and dont visit every state. The election is held every four years and we help choose our states elecotors when you vote for president because when we vote for the cadidate we actually vote for the candidates electors so it doesnt really make an impact on votes and i think that we should vote for the cadidates themselves  not there electors. So i think changing the votes to popular vote would benefit us all even if we dont get an ad or see anythin in our state even if the cadidates think they dont have achance in winning they should still participate.

efe5189,"Driving is a way of getting around quicker and to get to places you need to go, ever since the first car was mass-produced it has cuased a social drift where now in this generation almost all people use a car to get anywhere. Driving is fun and is a helpful way, but imagine if you had to lower the amount of time you would spend in you car, it wouldnt be the end of the world the only negative effect of not using your car is taking more time to get there and excersising. A car releases fumes into the air which cuases air pollution, driving is one big reasons why we have global warming. According to researchers people in Car-Free communities feel less stress without their cars, becuase having a car is a responsibility;buying gas, not denting/scratching the car, and ofcourse keeping it clean. Driving is everywhere and has been here for awhile, driving has also sadly played a role in deaths across the nation, Driving under influence, foolishness, accidents and so on and so fourth. Maybe less driving isn't such a bad idea after all, there are already countrys that practice less car usage, even car-free days.

When you have a car its a whole new world and responsiblitys you will have and you'll have to maintain it, but driving is not the only way of getting around, there is running and bicicyles and walking which are all healthy options, maybe next time we you need to go to the local store you can take a bike or run there yourself and save gas and lessen air-pollution, ofcourse one trip without a car won't save the world but its a start. This generation is closely tied to using cars and most of them don't think that when they use a car the effects it has on using a car. Cars have been a great invention but now their starting to become a life-style. One of the common results of driving is traffic it is seen all over the place and takes up time and cuases stress among drivers, less driving would clear up the roads and lessen stress for others and be a/n open oppurtunity for others to get healthy.

Cars make up around 50% of greenhouse gas in the United States and cars are a nasty contributer to Global warming the fumes of the cars go in the air and get trapped there and hurt the ozone layer, also gasoline a source we find underground which we are using more and more than we get and it is a non-renewable resource, we break down mountains just to find this resource. Oil has cuased political disputes and the loss of forest,enviorments and more. When a car is destroyed it is sent to the scrapyard which is a big land just for destroyed cars and it takes up space, and it once could have been a nice forest. Car usage also is the producer of smog, sometimes smog is so bad in countrys they would have to ban car-usage for a number of days; that means we are abusing cars just a little too much.

Lastly, Car-Free is not new or scaring it actually is a rising trend countrys have done Car-Free day and the culture is spreading across the areas, being outside without a car using a bike or skateboard is a nice calm and relaxing way to spend a day and thousands of people seem to think so too, statistics say in the US the amount of cars being bought is slowly declining and driving less and the amount of licenses being optained is too. In some states there bike sharing programs and communities without cars. Car-Free communties are a great way to save enviorment, lessen air pollution and to connect the community together instead of passing by taking a walk and or taking a bike ride with someone you would want to be with, and instead of hearing the constant sound of a motor engine hear the sound of children at play. Lessening car-usage can save money, less stress, and make you view things in a different perspective or even Car-Pool so others don't have to use their cars. Cars were made to reach places quicker but why would you need to be in a hurry?    ",5

The author supports his idea by proving good points and using evidence. You can tell he is sincere about this and would like for the scientists to try and further explore Venus and its commodoties. For example, in paragraph 8, he talks about how our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts. This is a very reasonable statement, and proves that he actually has a reason to want Venus to be explored. Also in paragraph 8, the author says, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This quote supports the authors idea because he is giving an ethical reason about why he wants scientists to create the technology to be able to put humans on Venus. He is explaining to the readers why he wants this to take place, and by giving his opinion, it automatically supports him and his idea.

c4a3d95,"Dear State Senator, I believe the electoral college should be changed to election by popular vote because, the electoral college is unfair to voters. According to the article

The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,

""

Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors , who in turn elect the president."" This doesn't seem fair at all, people put in their votes thinking they are voting for their canidate but instead a group of electors make the dedcision for them. It also doesn't seem right that the voters can't control who their electors vote for.

In the

Indefensible Electoral College article it also says that ""In the same vein faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" That doesn't seem right at all, if a canidate has the most popular vote they should be elected president since he is obviously the the one the voters want as their president. It shouldn't be up to the electors to just pick anyone they want just because they have the power to do so.

Some people may think that the electoral college is just fine the way it is,for example  in the article

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, the author seems to aggree with this way of voting and thinks the electoral college is worth keeping because there is a certainty of outcome and thinks that the voters in the ""Swing States"" should be the one to decide the election because they have more information and attention from the canidates. Is that fair?  All states should get the same amount of attention and infromation from the canidates because all of the votes are important and is the outcome ever really certain? How would we know the outcome of the election if the votes we put in all depend on a group of electors who could just pick whoever they like just because they can? How does that seem fair at all that the voters votes don't really matter and even if the canidate does get the most popular vote, the canidate still might not come out as the winner of the overall election?                       ",3
0fe1d3e,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"", we are introduced to a new type of technology. It is called the Facial Action Coding System. "" The process begins when the computerconstructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" Therfore, this system can basically determine your emotions, based on the movement of your face muscles. It has been stated that this technology can read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom and I think this is a very valuable sysytem to invest in.

In the text it was stated that , "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" To this day technology is being used more and more in classrooms and this is just a great addition. In schools many students do not understand the topics being teached and just need to process things more slowly to understand. If a computer could pick up the fact that they are confused and make the lesson easier for them, it would allow them to learn at their own pace. Taking things slowly rather than quickly is way more effective for many students across the world. Not only would this benefit them but benefit the schools grade averages and teaching effectiveness. The Facial Coding System classifies six basic emotions- happiness,surpise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness. This system not only can help a teacher determine when you are confused but when you are expierencing emotions that might seem off at that particular moment. For example, if you are sitting down in a classroom and the computer detects you are very sad than this will alert your teacher that you need help. You teacher can provide help by talking to you and together you guys may solve your problem. This will allow you to then focus on what is being teached in class better.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System can help you both physically and emotionally. This system can not tell what is going on in your head but can sense your physical emotions. Your physical emotions

tell a lot about you. No matter if you are angry,sad,happy or surprised you can get help from other people. In a classroom full of students it is very hard for just one instructor to focus on the needs of every student. If this sytem is installed in classroom computers it can help your instructor to attend to each individual students needs personally and more effectively. The Facial Action Coding System is very valuable for both teachers and students and proves to be a good investement in the education of hundreds of students globally if used. ",4
0678715,"Driverless cars? A car doing all the driving for you without you having to touch the wheel is of lazy. Why would you want a ""smar car"" do all the work for you. The more that the technology develops the more things people find to help you be more lazy. It's like people don't want to do anything themselves anymore.

When driving you really have to pay attention to not just yourself but other people. If you let the smart car drive you around it's not going to really be paying attention to other people.

491c3fb,"The usage of cars around the whole world has been the main reason why the earth is facing with air pollution problems and day by day our ozone layer is breaking. To solve this problem we can limit the usage of cars or any type of moving vehicle that can harm us and use other efficient ways to get to places.

There have been places in this world where they have started to move to make a difference in the earth. For example in source one ""Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"" except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs..."" in Vauban, Germany there are alot of suburban communities who have giving up using cars or have sold their cars to make their houses where they live. Not only have they be making car free streets but also have taken out parking spaces so that people can reduce the usage of cars. This change can be either economicaly better for everyone but can also be useful for people to start thinking to go outside more. In Bogota, Colombia they have created a program that is set to spread to all the Colombians to hike, bike, skate and also take the bus to their jobs, it is a car-free day like stated in this statement from source 3 ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."" This improvement campaign began in the mid-1990s.

In other countires like in source two ""after days or near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban to clear the air of the global city"" this was due to the large amount of smog that cars give out to the layers of air. The citizens of Paris would also have to pay a fine. Source two also states that ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitlas... [last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particular matter (PM) per cubic mater compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" this is the reason why Paris has started to make a change. They are many other solutions to changing the cars we us today to others like electrical cars where you only have to charge them and you can use them it would not harm our ecosystem in any way. Driving a car not only affects our earth but can be very stressful for the driver because he or she would have to face in their every day life traffic jams, but looking for other ways to get to your destination would separate you from having to go through that everyday.

One of the biggest produces of this problem is the United States of the America where all of the cars we know have been created and is also one the most more advanced countries. In source four is states that ""President Obamas's ambitious goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled las week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suugest that Americans are buying fewer cars, drivinf less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" as hard as this sounds if we dont get to moving we will soon die little by little. We also lower down the percentage of car accidents if we reduce the usage of cars, the level of mortality would not decrease so fast.

In conclusion, you have learned that driving a car is very harmful for the planet and if we dont start making a change our earth would be more polluted then how it is now. Start making a change and think smart.     ",3

Inventing driveless cars are a complete no to me. Eventhough they sound ""cool"", driveless cars could lead to big disasters all over the road. Having driveless cars does sound like a good idea but, you never know what the outcome could be. I think it's more about the safety of the people and not to have them in harms way. In the passage it says,""They can steer,accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"". If your going to make a driveless car might as well make it where it does everything by its self and it takes no human skills.

I think we should not keep the electoral college because we should have the right to choose who runs everything. We the people want to be free and vote on for what we want. Its not fair because the winner take all system in each state candidates they think they cant win.

Also if their is a tie the election will be thrown to the house of representitives. The senate would choose the vice president because each state gets one vote. That means the one representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters has as much say as 55 representatives from California with 35 million voters.

In the electoral college system voters vote for slate of electors not for presidents. They elect the president. It depends on the state who picks the electors. Voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency.

Best argument against the electoral college is what people call the disaser factor. 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. The system allowed much worse consider legislatures picking electors and those electors could lways defy will of the people.

The people should be the ones picking the people they want in charge of the government. Thats why there should be no electoral college and let us vote and choose who we want.

3561772,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports his idea by using various different pieces of evidence while implementing the reality of the potentially dangerous exploration. The new developments in technology put furth a new pathway of innovation in reserach. With the new advancements in technology, scienctist are able to discover many similarities between Venus and Earth. The similarities also bring to view the danger of the planet Venus itself. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because of the new advancements in technology, the similarities between the two planets, and the possible challenges of researching the untamed planet.

The ever growing advancement in technology allows for the further reasearch of the neighboring planet Venus. For example when the author says, ""another project is looking back to an old technology"" to gain insite of what previously worked and what could be improved. Another piece of evidence is when the author states an improvement that can be made, ""Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant"". The greater and never ending advancements in technology allows scientist to explore the vast similarities between our planet and Venus.

The similarities of Earth and Venus make the reserach worth wild and valuable. For example, Venus has become very fascinated by Astronomers because of how it is ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" which suggests that the research we gain from Venus could affect how we think about the Earth. Another example is when the author suggests that, ""venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planertary visit"".

Even with the similarities, the dangers of the planet can make the research difficult.

The conditions of Venus would make research very difficult but not impossible. The planet has many components that would make studying it very hard such as having, "" the hottest surface temperature"". Venus also has rough terrain and weather such as, ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightening strikes"" which would make landing a ship nearly impossible.

In conlcusion, the research of Venus is valuable to achieve because of the new technology, the likeness of our earth and Venus, and the challenges that will be faced during the reserach. ",4
4c3e6ba,"Limiting car usage will have many advantages. Not only will it reduce pollution ,but it will also incourage a more healthy lifestyle. Also limiting car usage may help ween us off of our dependence on foreign oil. Car usage has caused a lot of problems economically, environmentally, and physically for the United States.

To start off, car usage is very bad for our environment. The number one cause of air pollution in the U.S. is transportation. So, if we found a cleaner and more environmentally-friendly way of transportation that help a lot. One way would be to reduce car usage. It would be much better if once or twice a week people would ride their bike or walk to work or where ever they are going. I understand that some people live to far away from where ever they are going to ride a bike or walk ,but if you carpool with people who are also going to the same place you save on gas money and you will also be helping the environment.

In addition to helping the environment, limiting car usage will also promote a healthier life style. With the united state's obesity rates sky-rocketing we could use all the healthy lifestyle promoting we can get. By limiting car usage we can encourage people to walk and bike to where ever they are going. Which will influence people to add a little excersise into their daily routine.

Along with promoting a healthier lifestyle, limiting car usage can also help the U.S. withone major problem. Over the years the U.S. has had many great presidents,but almost all of them have promised the same thing, that they will reduce our dependence on foreign oil. But nothing has happened. I believe that limiting car usage will help us in reducing the United states' dependence on foreign oil because if we aren't driving our cars as often we won't need as much oil.

In conclusion, the advantages to limiting car usage are that it will reduce pollution, promote a healthier lifestyle, and it will reduce our dependence on foreign oil. So next time you go to drive your car just think, is it really that far?     ",4

My first reason on why driverless cars is a good idea is because it's safer. For example Google's cars that have been driving around everywhere is has driven more than a half a million miles without a crash, and why wouldn't it be better choice since it hasnt gotten into a crash yet. Are driverless cars a good idea?

My second reason on why driverless cars is a good idea is because it's smarter. The way the driverless cars are smart is because they use sensors to warn the driver when to manuver and they have cameras all around the car to detect other vehicles, and there is this one bit of technology that is in the car that makes it a smarter choice and that is the Dubbed Lidar, it uses laser beams to detect what's around the car. Are driverless cars a good idea?

My third reason on why driverless cars is a good idea is because it's more efficient. The way it's more effiecient is because it tells the driver when they are needed to control the wheel because of accidents and other hazards can make the car crash so the person driving needs to handle the wheel most of the time. Another detail about it being more efficient is that all the driver really needs to do is watch the road while the car does driving. Are driverless cars a good idea?

No, twenty five years ago, our Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Us scientists figured out that it was just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia, only this one had shadows that made it look like an Egyption Pharaoh. Very few days later, we revealed the image for all to see, and we made sure to note that it was a huge rock formation that just resembled a human head and face, but all of it was formed by shadows. We only announced it because we thought it would be a good way to engage the public with NASA's findings, and atrract attention to Mars-- and it did.

The face on Mars soon became a pop icon; shot in movies, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. Some people thought the natural landform was evidence of life on Mars, and that us scientists wanted to hide it, but really, the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. We decided to take another shot just to make sure we weren't wrong, on April 5, 1998. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team took a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos, revealing a natural landform, which meant no alien monument. ""But that picture wasn't very clear at all, which could mean alien markings were hidden by haze"" Well no, yes that rumor started, but to prove them wrong on April 8, 2001 we decided to take another picture, making sure it was a cloudless summer day. Malin's team captured an amazing photo using the camera's absolute maximum revolution. With this camera you can discern things in a digital image, 3 times bigger than the pixel size which means if there were any signs of life, you could easily see what they were. What the picture showed was the butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.

""But how do we know you're not just hiding things from us?"" You should know NASA isn't hiding anything from the people because if there was evidence of life it would benefit us, so why hide it? If you still don't believe the evidence the pictures are out for you to see, which obviously shows a natural landform. The reason to not believe these movies and magazines is because they ignore the research. They make up things to get the people going, but what they actually should do is pay attention to us, because we have very important findings every single day. ",3

Antilock brakes,Gps,magnets are some of the things used to modify a Toyata Prius.Driverless cars shouldnt be coming the should be staying with the ides left in 2009. I believe taht these kinds of cars will be dangerous to people on the street. This is excalty why car crashes could be more possible. What will happen with this car in todays time?

Unpredictable, outcomes with driverless cars could alway take place no matter where you are in the whole entire world. NO one should recommend a driverless car to me because i will surely not but nor will i recommend it to anyone else. Saving serveral lives ahead of time. People will still purchase this car because they are making it as high-tech as they can so more people will be interested with the car and could most likely buy it. Which would you rather do? Sit in a car while it drives itself being lazy or sit in the car start it up and put you hands on the steering wheel?

In Conclusion, what if someone is drunk with a driverless car and something happens to the vehical and there are people trying to cross the street the drunk man/women in the car cont do anything at all the try to save them or even thereself. My word is there dangerous and thats what im sticking to.",3
479e8ae,"In my opinion, driverless cars would be extremely dangerous in certain situations. Especially with teenagers drivers. This invention could have a very bad outcome. Cars without drivers is pointless to me. How will cars know where to go how to get there? How will they be able to detect when there is a pedestrian trying to cross? Driving should not be made easier for our community because it is a part of everyday life.

Citizens will only become lazier and have no urge or motivation to not only drive but all other natural things. A car that drives it self will only make our country worse no better. It is cool when we see cars driving themselves in movie and on television, but is it really worth it? There are many pros and cons of this particular topic. Prod are there would be a lower rate of deaths and car related injuries because not many people would be driving. As citizens we also have to think about the small percent on people that could possibly be driving. What if a car without a driver had a malfunction and went out of control. I think the result of this situation could be far more dangerous than two drivers colliding.

As a teenager working to get my listens and start driving, cars that drive themselves are not very smart. I think driverless cars is just another way of asking for more conflict and death rates in our country. inbelieve the industry is trying to make electronics too much like humans. They are trying to make these products almost impossible to work, and in the long run lives will be lost. Then th question will be, ""What should we do now? This was supposed to work."" In my opinion technology is far too advanced now then it should be. I can only imagine what it will be like in five to ten years. I just hope driverless cars will not be in the near future.",3
72c274b,"Driverless cars have facinated the mind of many, old and young alike. Whether one like it or not, a future with driverless cars seems inevitable. In truth, many car companies and even Google, have started projects on driverless car. Then, what about the people, the customers? Can everyone accept the idea of driverless car?

I for one, am rooting for the developments of driverless cars. I believe that driverless cars can be and will be safer than traditional cars. Google's car for example, even though it can only run under specific conditions, have gone more then half a million miles without a crash. Even though the car still need human control under certain circumstances, half amillion miles with out a crash is impressive. For normal human, I believe it will be hard.

Moreover, we have been using machines to help us in everyday life. Too much in fact, that it has become our lifestyle. Be it Micro-wave oven in the kitchen to our computers, we rely heavily on machines. And these machines perform better than ourselves. The driverless car will also be like these machines. In fact, the advancement in sensors have allowed cars to be braked on individual wheels and engines with far better response and control. This show that machines perform better than humans.

There is also the economic factor. Google co founder Sergey Brin envisions fleets of driverless cars forming a public-transport system. He believe these would use half the fuel today's taxis uses and have far more flexibility than a bus. When the world is struggling for natural oil, these cars only need half of the fuel modern cars need. That is a huge econimical advantage for everyone.

Although driverless cars will offer many benefits, making one is a hard task. Driverless cars today still need human's attention. Still, automakers are thriving towards the goal of making a self-driven car. This goal may seems far away, but we are moving towards it everyday.",4
fa17a90,"How many different emotions have you ever felt in your life? You cannot possibly know and remember every feeling you've ever had. Using the Facial Action Coding System is a great idea and an amazing thing that has been developed, however, there is no way it is accurate. The Facial Action Coding System is not accurate because everyone has different facial structures, this system could not possibly know the structure of everyones face, could not detect all emotions, and cannot tell an emotion by the way people look.

Though the face has the same muscles and bones in it, everyone has a different facial structure. Some peoples eyes are far apart, and some are closer together. Some people have more round faces, and others have more square shaped faces. The text states ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a fake smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."", but some people may not get crow's-feet around thier eyes, and some peoples mouths may not stretch sideways like this. There are many other differences in peoples faceial structures, aside from these examples.

All people feel different emotions in their life. They can also feel multiple emotions at one time. Saying that a face coding system can detect all your emotions is absurd. People have been known to feel exitement, while feeling resentment, and all other combinations of emotions. Technology today doesn't have any way of recognizing all emotions of everyone. The passage says, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" It is not hard to guess that humans are capable of feeling more than just six emotions alone or at the same time. This would mean that the recognizing emotons part of this system is inaccurate.

Acting and looking different than how you feel is an excellent way to hide your emotions. People do this almost on a daily basis. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Although this may be true some of the time, even smiling to hide a frown cannot always be dected by a friend. Unless clearly obvious, hiding emotions cannot easily be found. This adds to the previous reason of why the Facial Action Coding System would be inaccurate.

The Facial Action Coding System is not accurate because everyone has different facial structures, this system could not possibly know the structure of everyones face, could not detect all emotions, and cannot tell an emotion by the way people look. In conclusion, this system could be highly inaccurate and ineffective. Perhaps sometime in the future, when technology is much more developed, this system may work a little better, but it will still take many years to perfect the Facial Action Coding System.",4
92d24d8,"Driverless cars are our future, whether we want them to be or not. Since the first inventions people have always been opposed to new things. Driverless cars should not be one of them. They should be excepted because well, they are a good idea.

Think about something machine made. Anything at all. If you have two of those, compare them. Are they identical? Let's be honest, machines are perfect in what they do. Unlike humans, machines can all be programed the same, and will each do the same thing just as well as any other one would. Humans, on the other hand, make mistakes. If all cars are programmed the same way, they would all drive and react to situations the same way. In other words, they could be programed to always follow the speed limit and other laws. Some people just don't care about that sort of thing. No one would get hurt, even if you spent the whole night drinking. The driverless cars today give the ones of the future a bad rep. Technology is quickly improving. If you think all the sensors and other gadgets on todays cars are cool, wait until todays brainiacs really get down to working on them. You have to remember though, humans do make mistakes. Malfunctions are likely to happen, but if they do, way less people would be getting hurt compared to today.

How many people die due to texting and driving every year? Driverless cars could stop that from happening. Ever again. All those crosses you may see on the side of the road are a sign to what could be avoided. Driverless cars could stop putting those up all together. The people involved in making todays driverless cars are already putting something together. While you're sitting in your car that's driving itself, you may get bored. Pop up entertainment systems are already under consideration. Though today the driver will be alerted to any hazard on the road, and the pop up would be put away, that would not be the case in the future. You could text away and the car could handle any situation the road throws at it. I do believe, however, that people should still learn how to drive. If the car does fail, and stop working, the person in the vehicle should be able to take control of it and get it off of the road.

People against this new innovation have good reasons as to why they are. I understand not being in control can worry many people, but driverless cars that work the way I explained are far from becoming a reality. The people of the future can slowly be weaned into this new car. To them, owning a car that drives itself will be no different then how we feel about our cars today. These cars are the future, a future in which accidents are a rarity and stupid people behind the wheel can't hurt anyone on the road anymore. So don't be afraid of this new idea, embrace it. Driverless cars, when completed and working to the best of their ability could save many lives, and lead the world to a new exciting future.   ",4
c30c7da,"Dear Senator, I feel the need to bring the Electoral College to your attention. I think keeping the Electoral College is not a good way to vote for the president of the United States. It's an unfair way to vote. 538 electors and the majority of 270 votes to elect the president seems to have problems every time. If the person running for office has more votes it obviously means they want that person to win the election. So why go around that process and change everything and make it more difficult for the person to win? People all over keep trying to change things with voting but don't have a choice. When they vote for someone in office it doesn't equal a whole percent which actually goes towards whether or not they will or will not be president. Thanks to the Electoral College it makes things harder. Thats's why people don't like to vote. So Senator, please think about getting rid of the Electoral College it's fair that the person with the most votes should win because if everyone voted for them they wanted that person to win. That's more fair than popular votes and then what the other 538 people have to say.

Sincerly,

ca49bac,"In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars when it spotted what appeared to be a likeness of a human face in a region called Cydonia. Over the years there has been speculation that this ""face"" was created by aliens. But over the years new equiptment has revealed the ""face"" for what it is: a mesa.

There are three key points of evidence that disprove the alien theory: the equiptment first used to photograph the Face on Mars is rudimentary compared to the equiptment used for the 2001 image, the sky was clear on Mars when the 2001 image was taken, and Earth has similar landforms on its surface. For example, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spams 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" Technology has advanced much from since 1976 and 2001 image is a clear example. The 2001 image also has another detail that can't be left out: it was taken on a cloudless Martian day. A last piece of evidence sure to disprove the alien theory is the fact that Earth has similar landforms on its surface. The Face on Mars, ""...is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.""

To conclude, the Face on Mars was not created by aliens. The image from 1976 was photographed with equiptment that is rudimentary compared to the equiptment used for the 2001 image, the Martian sky was cloudless when the 2001 image was taken, and the 2001 image proved that the Face on Mars is the Martian equivalent of a mesa, something commonly found on Earth.",3

I would like to in favor of keeping the Electoral College for many purposes. The Electoral College know the process of becoming a president and some of the people voting dont really know how the process works. The eletors are the one to elect the president and not the people,people's vote will not have any affect of the election of the president.

The electoral college knows the process of becoming a president ,some citizens dont really know the process of becoming a president. what if we the people just vote and we dont know if our vote counts. The excerpt states""when you vote for a presidential candiate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"". This indicates that we think our vote if for the election of the president but its not. Therefore,we should pay attention of who we elect and knowing how the voting system work out. keep on mind that the electoral college is a good system and that we should count on them.

Do you know who elects the president? well,its the electoral college the one who elects the president,many people think that we the people choose but,they are actually wrong. ""270 electoral votes is requierd to elect the president"",this indicates that we dont really have control of picking the president. ""it's possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote"", but does'nt often happen.

It all comes down to one point,we should let the Electoral College choose who they want to elect the president. We all want different people to be president but at the end we have too choose who will help the U.S to be powerful. Our nation wll be ruled by the people and for the people.                    ",2

The author doesn't use wording that makes him sound stuborn or demanding.

The article also brings up the idea of studying Venus gradually, instead of pushing the idea right away.

Also, the author is very honest about the conditions of Venus.

All of this taken into consideration, the author's view on the matter is compelling and well supported.

The author's suggestion is well supported throughout the article.

As the author brings up the idea of studying Venus they address the problems and give solutions for them, instead of brushing over them.

This is shown when the author talks about a technology that NASA is working on that could help. He wrote,"" By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat , and other forces.""

The author also gives benefits that a human would be helpful for humans if they were to go and study Venus. The author states,"" Solar power would be plentiful, and radation would not exceed Earth levels.""

The author also realizes that the conditions on Venus would not be comfortable and makes this known when he wrote,"" Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.""

In conclusion the author supports their idea of studying Venus exceedingly well.

The author not only makes know the problems that everone worries about but also offers solutions for them.

They also gradually make their view know instead of pushing it right away. The article is very compelling with the amount of information given and honesty that the author has when talking on the subject.

Since, the author addresses the dangers of studying Venus and tries to solve them or atleast work around them the article is overall informative and well supported.",4
e628d55,"Every four years america as a whole chooses on who should be the president of the united states. The process of election is straight forward and always follows the same process every election. The american citizens vote on one of the two candidates, then those votes are counted and giving to the electors, then the electors of each state representing the population of said state (including the District of Columbia) votes one of the candidates, after all votes are tallied the winning candidate is elected president. Overall this system seems rather complicated and can be seen as an unfair process at which only to vote on who takes charge of america. The electoral college should be replaced by who receives the most popular votes from all american citizens and not the state electorals.

Electoral college is a process created during the founding of the united states as sort of a ""middleground"" or compromise on how the people of the country should elect the president (

source 1

). In order for a president to be elected out of the 538 electors that make up the electoral college he or she must at least receive 270 votes (

source 1

). Each president has a group of electors that process your votes in order to choose who the state votes for making it in a ways unfair. This system can come with its own set of problems that include replacement of electors, electors voting to who they feel, and at times one candidate gaining the most popular vote but losing the chance of presidency because of the lack of electorol votes form the state (

source 2

). An example of the unbalanced power is the near success of the louisiana legislature replacing the democratic electors in the 1960, segrigations with new ones that would oppose against John F. Kennedy making him lose the popular vote.

The best replacement for the electoral college is to allow the citizens of america to vote upon who should be the president of the U.S without the need for electors. The candidate that receives the most votes is the one who becomes the president of the united states. In order to process all possible millions of votes into a rational percentage and the candidate with the higher percentage would in turn become president. With this in mind the candidates would need to visit all or largely selected states in order to deliver campaign speeches to persuade the population to vote for them, because with the electoral college system candidates would focus mainly on tight races in the ""swing states"" practically ignoring other like in the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt see their candidate (

source 2

). The electoral college only focuses on the large numbers and not on the smaller population that can still make a difference making the system unfair. Making them only focus on the big states because how many electoral votes it could bring compared to a smaller state which could possibly only supply three.

On the other side electoral college does have a good standing as a method of vote. Electoral college has five good reasons on why it shouldn't be replaced and they are certainty of outcom, everyone's president, swing states, Big states, and avoid run-off elections (

source 3

). Each campaign party chooses their electors which rarely end in betrayel making it possible to win the election with low popularity votes. The electoral system also gives the candidate a chance to win in a ""landslide"" because of the winner-take-all basis at which it follows (

source 3

). No region has enough votes to elect a president also the electoral college needs to have transregional appeal. And the main goal of the electoral college is to obviously elect a new president but as well avoid runoff elections.

The electoral college is an unfair system of voting because of how it all depends on a small group of selected representatives and not all of the american population as a whole. Even though it can be regarded as a fair middle ground it still has its flaws and doesnt reach out to society as a whole only focusing on the states that can lead to victory, casting out those who's electoral votes will not make much of a difference. In the end the voting system should mainly focus on popularity of a candidate than what the ""state"" feels they should vote for because of how many votes they actually received for a given candidate due to the fact that it may end up voting on which who they feel and refuse to vote for their partys candidate. The electoral system should be replaced.    ",5

""On the planets surface, temperatures verage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.""

I think that we should explore Venus because we should be able to know all of our solar system, but it will be challenging, because of the temperatures, and the pressure.

I like the idea of a havor craft to avoide the hot surface. ""a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.""

The only bad thing would be is that what if the hover craft breaks down then they would crash, we dont even know if Venus has spitting lava of the ground. Another example of why exploring Venus is a good idea, is that we can discover new speiceys or materials, mabye even find if there were ancient life on Venus.

742da12,"I believe Facial Action Coding System is very valuable to students it helps tell where the student is confused, if they don't get any of it at all or if the student totally gets & doesn't need extra help.

I think that Facial Action Coding System is important because, teachers can help students where they left off at. Some students may understand half of the assignment but not all of it & why re teach it all of it when the teacher could just help the student where the student left off. This is also very valuable because some students will say they get it but really don't so they won't look a certain type of way in front of their peers. This makes the teacher job a little bit easier & the a lot less stressful to the student, knowing the teacher knows he or she needs help without saying it out loud.

This would cause less students to fail & higher grades for sure because everyone in the classroom is getting the help that they need.

This Facial Action Coding System also is very valuable because, it lets the teacher know if the students don't even get it at all. A lot of students will not raise their hand for help, to not look like they don't get it while everyone else gets it. This Facial Action Coding System would benefit those type of kids that are shy to raise their hands in class for help. All together this would lead to much better grades for all the students for everyone in the class, it would help the teacher find new ways to explain the assignment using another method. Which is a plus for the students, this Facial Action Coding System works not only for students but for the teacher to.

One last reason i think the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable is because, it focous on the students that really need help. If one half of the class gets the assignment then the teacher doesn't need to keep going over it again if that side of the class already understand. This helps the teacher a lot becuase a teacher goal is to pass everyone in the class & by doing so help the students that need it the most. This would make school a lot less stressful.

This invention helps tell where the student is confused, if the student dosen't get any of it at all or if the student totally gets & doesn't need extra help. I think this invention is one of the best inventions we have ever came across. This invention takes so much pressure of students, they don't have to worry as much about not learning the assignment. This helps the teacher job a lot more easier the invention works hand & hand. This would for sure bring grades up if the student is willing to put in the work to learn the assignment that the teacher is teaching.         ",4

The Electoral vote should be converted to election by popular vote. By using popular vote, the majority of voters will be satisfied when it comes to the election of the president. When you use the Electoral College System, you dont vote for the president of your choice, you're voting for the how ever many representitives that pleged for them.

(Source 2, Paragraph 10)

Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now.

(Source 2 Paragraph 9)

Even the voters would perfer majority rule. The map in

Source 3 shows that some states have more representitives then others. Thus meaning that many states were treated unfair when it came to elections because they didnt have many votes to represent them. Especially during the 2000 campaign. Seventeen states did not recieve any candidatesat all.

(Source 2 Paragraph 13)

If some states dont get represented the people wont be happy. If the people arent happy then hectic will end up breaking out. As well as if the people arent happy, then they wont do what they are told because they are unhappy with it. People would like to vote to express their political prefrence more so then thinking a single vote could decide an election.

(Source 3 Paragraph 3)

In conclusion, the citicens of the United States would be more appreciated if they got to choose themself and put their own political input in on who became the president. Then so, Americans will be happy and riots, political protests, and/or hectic will not break out in the United States of America.    ",3

Some people had thought that it was fake and others thought that it was just a coincidence. The massive sand storms just created a face. That's all that they thought. But can that be true?

The face on Mars really hit it off on Earth. Everyone was talking about it. "" The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery story chechout lines for 25 years!"" Some people believe that this face was created by aliens; it is a sign of life on Mars. But, ""few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact."" That is just crazy, but scientists are backing it up. There is no proof for it to be alien made.

Certain people still say that ""it's aliens, aliens are making these faces!"" That is not true without the evidence. Which, there is none. There are ablolutly zero facts that aliens would be able to make a face. Or that there are aliens. No facts. No aliens. If there were aliens how would they even make a face?

This has to be just a natural landform that formed when a massive sandstorm hit. It is just a coincidence. Nothing freaky or wierd, just a face in the sand. It's natural, not an alien. According to the text, ""What the picture actually shwos is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" See, nothing wierd going on on Mars. Or at least that we know of.

So, in conclusion, this artifact of mars is real. This is, because, there are no facts to prove otherwise. If there were facts than it would be ruled an alien artifact. Which would be pretty cool, but it isn't real. And we shouldn't be pretending like it is real. Scientists are backing this up here they are saying that it can't be an alien artifact. It's impossible as of right now. There is no evidence that an alien has made this face in the sand. ",4

Driving is one of our human rights. it helps as connect to others, do we really want to lose that? Don't you want to go through the fun but stressful time of teaching your son or daughter, how to drive. We lose family traditions,bonding experices, our independce and jobs. Cars don't just help us in our everyday like we help them.

What's going to happen to our econmy when people who spent money to go to college to be a car engine, car only get a job at one place. One place that needs less people. What do we do when this car brakes down? It's electronic so our regular joe of the mill enginers can't fix. But

Then what happens if we do have time to get control. Do we swive taking the chance of hitting something maybe even another car. Saying that by this point we are atleast paying atention to the road now. For the cars that let us watch a movie while the car decides to shuts off when we need to drive.What if the screen gletches.

163010e,"Making Mona Lisa Smile is written by Nick D'alto. In this passage Nick, describes the new technology he discovered that can read your emotion and tell you exactly the emotion you are feeling and break it dowm into a percentage. In the passage, he list values on this can be great for students in the classroom.

I agree that this technology can be an improvment to the students today. Forming an education based on someones emotion would be brilliant. This can help improve students grades and help them learn in their own way. This technology could be the future. In paragraph 6 it explains that, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This technology could even help students want to go to school and learn. It could also help students study their for their test, do their homework, and learn outside of school.

There are some cons to this though, there are a lot of students that just simply do not like school whatsoever. The point is, their facial expression will always read ""bored"" or just uninterested. There could also be a student who could have had a tragedy happen to him and he goes to school sad and, the lesson his changed up to where when he's back to his normal self and ready to learn, he becomes even more confused. Another student for example, could be going through depression, and depression could last to nearly a year maybe even more. This would have his whole education based on the wrong thing.

Another problem is that this may not stretch students to their full potential. This is based on their way of learning, It is all based on the easiest way for them to learn. A lot of times in teaching, you have to make students learn and study things that the do not wanna learn but they have too. Society today needs students to reach pass their limits and become more of what they think they can be. This technology could soften the way of learning for students. This technology would work great for ads as said in the passage but for me, their is more cons then pros in this situation.

Even with the temperatures of up to eight-hundred degrees farenheight and with an atmospheric pressure that is ninety times greater than what we experience on Earth, I see why the author thinks that pursuing this journey will be worth it.

One reason why I think the author is for pursuing the journey to Venus is because of the analogous features that Earth and Venus share. In paragraph four of the text, the author states that the surface contains of a ""rocky sediment"" and ""includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This is crutial to the author's point because it shows how, in many ways, Earth and Venus are so much alike. Just as the author questions, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussin furthur visits to its surface?""

One of NASA's possible solutions is another reason why I feel the author thinks it is worth the trip to Venus. This solution is described as sending a spaceship to outer space to hover about thirty or more miles above the surface. According to the article, ""...temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level."" The article also implies that there would be plenty of energy through solar power and would be survivable, but with rough conditions.

Even with the advanced technology that we have today, scientists are beginning to look back and discover that mechanical computers that were used back in the 1800's and 1900's might just be the technology that we need to study Venus. According to the text, ""...systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" The advanced technology that we have today is not meant to be used in conditions such as Venus has. With this being said, these mechanical computers could be very important in studying our pursuit to Venus in the future.

In conclusion, the exploration to Venus could be very dangerous or very benefitial to the future of space exploration. Though, with the similiarities between Earth and Venus, the possible approach of hovering the planet, and using technology that will substain such conditions all are reasons why this journey could be worth the danger. No one will ever find the answers to their questions, if they choose not to explore them.             ",4
2650cb7,"I think the face on Mars is a natural landform because anything can form on land and there is a coincidence that that land formation can look fimiliar to something on Earth, like a human's face. The face on Mars was photographed, so we arent really seeing what the face on Mars looks exactly like, but we are seeing alot of it. Though, the image of the face in the best Viking photo in 1976 proves to show that, because of the 2001 photo's image span of 1.56 meters, if there were ships, planes, or even small shacks, you would be able to spot them out in the photo. What the Viking photo really shows is the Martian equivalant of a butte or mesa, which are both found commonly in the American West. Therefore, Mars has many land formations of all shapes and sizes, so the face that we all know and are so curious about; could just be another on of Mars natural landforms.",2

How this device works is that the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, then studys all 44 major muscles. Moving one or more mucsles is called an action unit. After that Dr. Huang relies on Dr. Pual Eckman, the creator of FACS to find out how the preson is feeling.

The FACS software can track facial movements even if your not smiling as broadly. Just when you think that is all it can do it can also identify mixed emotions each exspession is compared to a nertarl face showing on emotion. We humans can also do this, but we would have trouble describing each facial trait. Dr. Huang wants to do a test on Mona Lsa to see if she is really smiling or not. There going to use the software to see if it can tell use if she is or not.

as you can see this software is a grate tool i can see this devise helping use out a lot in the futer. If you are interested in doing this then go look at your self and then ask your partner if he or she knows what your feeling right now. I fell like we should have more people like Dr. Huang, and Dr Paul Eckman cuase the world is changing and we need to try to keep up and not fall be hind.

5791ef7,"Technology has grown in the past couple years. It has grown so much tha now computers can read human emotions. Emotions and computers normally are seperate from each other. Every human has a different emotion and ways to show these emotions. Now computers could read our emotions. With a new technology called FACS, Facial Action Coding System.

FACS could possibly affect how teachers could run a class. Teachers never truely know if a student is paying attention to the lesson or not. FACS could show the emotion of the students and teacher in a daily classroom. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modifly the lesson, like an effective human instructor""(Paragraph 6). Computers could read the emotions of studetns then give a report back to the teacher in order for the teacher to see the students emotions. The teachers could even use FACS in a lesson or a lab.

In the article ""Makin Mona Lisa Smile"", in the seventh paragraph it gives steps how to read emotions in person. Teachers could use the steps to explain how FACS works before a lab. Being able to use FACS in lessons/labs could interest the student in the lesson. A main class that could use it is the health class, for the emotion section of the book, or class. Friends can read their own friends emotions very well because the friends know each other so well. ""For instance,you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face."" (Paragraph 5). Instead of teachers not being able to tell the emotion just by looking at a students face then maybe FACS could help allow the teacher to make lessons emotionally fun.

If teachers could use this type of techology in classes for lessons then maybe FACS could be a valuble thing. The teachers could use the students emotions to make a lesson good or bad. With Technology at a rise right now the students may enjoy using FACS due to the fact that it is technology. ""Most human communcation is nonverbal including emotional communtion,"" notes DR. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that, too."" (Paragraph 6) FACS could also make the students want to pay attenition in class more. Each student would have a different emotion to the new technology.

Different emotions are common and there are different ways to show those emotions. This new technlolgy, FACS, could help the different emotions be caught in a class. You do not want any sleeping students in a classroom.",3
cafeccc,"In vauban, Germany Residents of this upscale communitiy are suburban pioneers, were a few people like to call home because street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district.

As a result 70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars and 57 percent sold there car so the could move to there. The good thing is that some people were really tense when they had a car and now they are more happier in there new enviorment. In 2006 they were an example of a growning trend in Europe, the Unied States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movment called ''smart ''planning''.

To begin with, things can be way more calm in a life without cars. Many people happen to beleive that cars can change how you feel for example ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way""(3). Heidrun Walter always felt tense with a car now she feels calm and relaxed. Life with less cars can be so much more relaxing without all the loud annoying noises cars make. In Vauban they are making some changes to how the people live so they can live more easy and calm. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in a low-car suburban life.""(6). The way this civilization is all the people live close by and everything is close by so you dont really need a car. If everything is close by everything can be more fluent and calm.

In addition, it may be more calm without cars but it is also better for you and the enviroment. ""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emission in europe... and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States.""(5). Wherever you are in the world greenhouse gasses will most likley affect your environment in some unnatrual way and that is not the best thing for you, the people you know, or all the plants and animals. Without cars polluting earth we would be way more healthy and many animals may not be endangered or extinct like they are today.""how much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.""(7). If you drive less its not just better for the environment and your health it can also be better for your wallet. If you drive less you save money on gas that you can use for many other things. Overall driving less turns out to be better for everyone.

In conclusion, people driving less can make life easier and calmer, it is also better for people, plants, animals, and don't forget your wallet.     ",4

The use of driverless cars beneifits use because they arent driverless in certain conditions. These are arent driverless and require the use of the driver conditions like pulling in and out of driveways, getting through complicted traffic issue, and getting through road work. This will have a negative affect because they should be able to work under all condition of driving. Driverless cars can have negative aspect and positve aspect on the driving laws .

8327ea8,"The Electoral college has been around for a long time but, do we really need it? Is it your votes that affecting your next president. Under the electoral college it is not. The electoral college says that voters do no vote for the president but for a slate of the electors, which elect the presidents. We need to kept the voting process we have now so that way we don't arguments throughout the states. In the electoral college yoor vote is sent to someone not holding public office.

When you vote you are getting a slate of the vote and to feel that their vote does not matter, that the new president will have no regard for their interest,is he really your president. The way we vote today is not that best we can do in some ways. I think that we need to have all the voters votes count towards the president that they want. We should let the people vote for who they want and not for someone else to vote for you. The constituiton says ""We the people, By the people,For the people."" So we should vote for who we want to represent us. The electoral college is based of a winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates.

Another factor that is wrong with the electoral college is that bigger states like Californa get more votes than Columbia. So for example, say that Californa gets 45 electoral votes and then Columbia has the same amount of voters vote for the president they want they will only gte about 5 to 8 because of the state size. Once again restating that we need to vote for we want to and have everyone's vote coung not just the votes added up and then shrunk to electoral votes. The electoral college does have some help in some ways like in a run-off election. The electoral college help control that and produces a clear winner.

The elecoral college does some advantages too, but it still has disadvantges. The electoral college is  the president wins by popular vote. The electoral college has a total of 538 electors but, sometimes the electors don't always listen to their voters and vote for who they want not who the state wants. The president has their own group of electors which have been chosen by the canidate's political party, but certain state lwas vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The election is every four years on the first Tuesday of November, which gives you time to think who you want to be the next president and cast a vote, but with the electoral college your vote could not really count. Have knowing that your vote may not count will make you upset and rethink about voting.

In conclusion, the eletoral college has some good things that does help us but, it has bad things too that make is sadband angry. We decide who we want to run our country but, e need to think about how the voting process really works. I am only one person but, one person can make a difference. So just remeber on thing 'We the people, By the people, For the people.""    ",2
2b98752,"The United States has ways of being civilaized, and thats by electing leaders. Those leaders that take role of the responsiblitiy are President. Presidents need candidates to vote for them. The only way the President will get elected is by the Electoral College or by popular vote. Although both ways are effective, only one way is the best. The U.S should stick with the Electoral College because its a game changer and trust worthy.

To start off the Electoral College is a game changer for Election Day. In the article "" In Defenese of the Electoral College"" the author states a good claim. Richard states "" the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"". From this quote Richard points out the even when a candidate has a good amount of  popular vote it all comes down to the Electoral College. The reason is the Electoral College is part of the candidate's team, whether its Democrat or Republican. In the article from Richard he gave an example, "" Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney"". In this peice of information Richard clearly states on how the Electoral College is stronger then the popular votes. Now in the article ""the indfensible Electoral College"" which was written by Bradford has a different claim. Bradford states "" because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"". From this Bradford wants to express that the Electoral College is not fair to voters, and that it has cheesy methods. But even thought Bradfort disagrees with the method, Bradfort still stated the obvious. In the article Plumer states "" taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency"". Although Plumer disagree with the electoral college, Bradford still notices on how the electoral college makes a huge difference. Basically the Electoral College is just a big game chnager on Election Day.

Futhermore the Electoral College is just a trust worthy method to use. Also it was like the first method to be used. In the first source ""What is the Electoral College"", the author gives some great information. The office states "" the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resposibilities are"". In this statement the Office is stating on how whichever party a person might be in, the electoral college will come through. The reason is because each state has an Electoral college and those states are in differnet parties. If the state that a person might live in is Democrat then the electoral college will go for that party, and same thing for the Republican party. From the other side of Bradford again wants a comeback. In his article Bradford states ""in the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refuesd to vote for their party's candidate"". Now no one would know if this is true but the electors might have their reasons. But Richard A. Posner comes back and states ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. In this quote its supports the fact that the electors do choose who they please. Plus this makes it fair because candidates wont be getting votes all over the places. Also the electoral college will be trust wirthy because the college follows the majority of the people's vote, and then makes a vaild decision. So the electoral college just gives people want they want from trust.

All in all the Electoral College is just the better method of voting. The Electoral College will give what the people want. Also the electoral college  represents the states votes. The reason is because electoral colleges are game changers and a trust worthy method. Certainly it wll be easier to choose a president and break ties.    ",5
4fd0b9a,"Scientist wants that Venus can be explore, but the dangers that has it, don't make them see that it is not to easy to go to Venus.

Scientists are fascinated with how Venus is. The simple thing that it looks similar like our planet make them to try to explore it. And like in the past humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this planet, but each previous mission was unmanned, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. But all this issues is because how Venus is.

Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets. On the planet's sujrface, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, this makes Venus the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frecuent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and incluides familiar features sech valleys, mountains, and craters.

Even though scientist are trying to make more efficient technology, there still been problems to land in Venus.

bc92463,"The driverless car movement is a absolutly great idea. Everyday tasks would be completed faster and easier than ever before.

This movement could change the world as we know it.

Wouldn't it be so much better if no one had to worry about drivers being under the influence of drugs or alcohol? It will take a while for this to catch on, but once it does, every thing will move in a positive direction. It would even be better for the environment. If Sergey Brin says that he can cut the fuel consumption in half, that would save the environment AND money. Also, if there were more semi-autonomous cars than there were regular automobiles, there would be significant difference in crashing rates.

There would be some disadvantages though. Let's admit it, when people are late to an event, they tend to go over the speed limit in order to make it on time. It's a natural thing to do. Also, there will be times when the self driving cars act up. Although it would a rough start for the driverless car, eventually, all the bugs and screw ups will be fixed.

57605e0,"In the article they are talking about a new technology called Facial Action Coding System where the computer can identify human emotions. I think that this new technology can be very valuable for teachers in schools to know when a student is sad or upset. The computer can help a teacher/adult to understand when a student is in need of a talk or needs to express their emotions. This is also very valuable because it could potentially save a life in bad situations. The computer facial coding system is valuable in my opinion for various reasons as you may see in this essay.

This system can alert a teacher or anyone when there might be something wrong with a person, whether it is good or bad. To be able to understand how a person feels may be one of the best new technologies created. Knowing when a person is feeling sad, angry, happy, etc, can really be great for if they need someone to talk to. It could make things better or make things not so good. Just having those options of emotions to be recognized is something very amazing. Even though this system can't contol your emotions or thoughts, it can really help to understand when there is something good or bad going on.

In the conclusion to figuring out if this new technology system is valuable, it most certainly is. It can be useful in many ways. I think another use for this could be in hospitals to detect if a patient is lying about their emotions. Even though a patient in a hospital may not like this because it can see their true emotions, it might be able to help them in the long run. If this technology can help manage what another person is feeling then it can make them see whats really going on, even if they lie about it.

The computer will construct a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. All of humans show the same facial expressions but maybe some at different times. The Mona Lisa demonstration is intened to bring a smile to our face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. ",3
6d96038,"Dear,

Senator of florida is send you this letter to tell you why we need to keep things the way they are. Electoral college is a process in which we decide who will be our president of the United States of America. During this process the Electoral College consist of 538 electors in which 270 of those electoral votes is required to elect the President. During this presidential election you vote for you candidate but what your actually doing is voting for your candidate's electors. All though the electoral colleges have things wrong with it they do have have some positive things that counter the negative out. Like certainty of a outcome,avoiding run-off election,you have to have trans-regional appeal(everyone's President),Swing states, and Big states.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 200-but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. Winning candidate's share the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. For example,Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast for him and Romney.... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner- take-all basis. A nationwide electoral vote is possible because 538 is a even number, but its  highly unlikely. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012's election to focus more on toss-up states. As the people of these states are very thoughtful in deciding who they will pick because they are the people that pay close attention to the campaing.

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anarchonism. People believe that it should be changed to who ever gets the most popular votes. People only believe it should be changed because of what has happened in the past with other elections. Like what happened in 200,1960 segregationists in the legislature nearly succeded in replacing the demacratic electors, and the worst being that it ends up in a tie. Things have happened in the past.

We dont need to change because of things that happened in 2000 or 1960. Its 2015 and we dont need a change to our way of deciding the president. Theres no reasonto changing it to popular vote.    ",3

a6e9772,"Driverless car's? Would there be more accidents or would it take away most of the accident's happening now. How will we know if it is safe or not? Only way to know is by building the driverless car and taking it for a test. Either way, google cofounder Sergey Brin, imagine's a time in the future where no one needs car's.

The driverless cars in my opinion are no different than any other actual car. They both really have all the same part's, but maybe not all. The driverless car has to have sensors, speed sensors, certain types of brake's, and a video camera on the rearview mirror plus more. These car's are worth so much, but could also cause tons of problem's. Not only for the driverless car, but for the other cars driving, and the people in them.

With that being said, no one is really worried about how the car may be or look, but if it can follow the laws of keeping others safe. Lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers.

Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020.

To end my conclusion, with all that has been said automakers will continue to search an bulid more interset into these smart cars.

It would be so cool if scientist and researches could one day come up with an innovation to be able to find more about venus. If venus is actually a second earth-like there can probally be another earth. So yes, venus is worth studying despite the dangers it represents. ",2

7c051fb,"Everyone has their opinion about the Electoral College, but does everyone look into it and get all the information they need about it before jumping to conclusions? Truth is, there are some who just assume they know everything about the Electoral College to make a decision. Then there are those who do research and look into the facts.

Under the electoral college system, voters don't even vote for the president they actually  vote for a slate of electors that elected that president. In source 2, it states that the single best arguement against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The statement is that American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system we have now is said to allow for something much worse than that.

Although many people despise the Electoral College, there are also some good reasons to keep this method of choosing the President stated in Source 3. Some of the reasons are certainty of outcome, no trans-regional appeal, and avoiding run-off elections. These are just three reasons despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.

The Electoral College is looked at as a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The most worrying thing that could possibly happen is a tie in the electoral votes. If this was to occur, the election would be taken over by the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the President.    ",3

You should help people who are suffering because of World War 2. We can go all around the world and when we are not working we can look around in the country we are in. My friend Don covinced me to join so you should join.

The program was started by the UNRRA or the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. They hired the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of hores, young cows, and mules while they where going across the sea. they fed the animals hay and oats and gave them water. I one time almost died when I was working on the boat at night and watching the animals. I slipped and was sliding down and if the peace of metal was not there I would of fallen into the dark Alantic. I could not though because of my cracked ribs. Other things we would do while on the boats is play table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling to pass the time. I have benn doing this for many years but i dtill love it and you just meet so many new people on the boat and in all the different countrys.

To conclude I hope you will join the Seagoing Cowboy program. we need so many more people to help us on the the boat. You will like all the animals But somtimes we just need more help taking care of the animals. If you ever fell like joining you know what to do. We all hope that you will join us.",3
0916f2c,"The Facial Action Coding System would be a great addition to everyday school life. This computer system can help with several things from elementary school to college. This could also change the way the world works forever. The FACS can easily be an important part of our education society.

The first and most effective thing FACS would impact is student's attitudes in the classroom. If FACS was active on all of the students computers, it could detect their emotions to influence them to get back on track and focus. It could also simply just keep the concentration going about the lesson being instructed. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto 6) . This can improve the interaction in class and can also improve many students grades.

If FACS was implemented into schools, students would feel more involved in the lecture, and pay attention more while being extra alert. Students will also be more knowledegable due to the fact that they are taking in information and really getting to learn about it, instead of just trying to find the answers that will satisfy on a worksheet or test. While feeling more involved, alert, and learning a lesson with full attention, this will impact grades greatly. This will help even more students proceed on into the next step of education, which is college.

FACS would benefit in grade school and would most definitely continue to help students in college. College can get difficult, but FACS could influence to keep students focused when they seem to become overwhelmed by their expressions. If students are impacted by FACS when they are younger and proceed on to college while continuing their education, there then comes a career. FACS will help in high school to get you to a college of your dreams, also best fit for your major. Then in college, it will help you focus and be actively listening and learning about your major to help you find a career that best fits you and your abilities. If everyone could have the opportunity to have the career as what best suits them, they will have an easier life and being more helpful to the people around them.

If FACS started being used in elementary school, proceeded to middle school, and so on in high school; it will teach students the habit of fully paying attention in class and being active. It will improve grades greatly. It will also help college students stay focused, even when times seem to become difficult. They will also already be influenced to stay active and fully aware of the lesson in class. If a student has well listening skills and is knowledgeable of their major, they will find the best job for theirself. If more people began to find jobs that benefitted them, and they were happy doing it, it would impact more than just students, it would impact the whole world.             ",4

You will travel all across the country. In the pasage it states that, when Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldnt resist. It was a opportunity of his life time. Once they left Europe they recived their orders to report to New Orleans. They boerded the SS Charles W. Wooster, that was headed for Greece.

They will give you a chance to do things you would've never thought of going before. In the passage it states, Luke had made 9 trips. When they saw the Acropolis in Greece that was speical to them. They also took a gondola ride in Veince, Italy, A city with streets of water. Luke was excited to get a chance to ride in a cattle boat. Luke states in the passage, ""the cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy, besides helping people, he had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

You will get a chance to change your life. In the passage it states that, luke graduated high school and was working two part-time jobs ina grocery store and a bank. Now instead of working two-part time jobs Luke is now on a cattle boat traveling to China, Greece and Europe. From helping out his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared him for hard work for what ever hed did. Being a Seagoing Cowbow was much more than an advantage for luke Bomberger.

For all these reasons this is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You will change your life by travling the world. They will travel all across the country. You'll get an adventure and learn new things. You will do things you would've never thought of doing before on your daily bases. This is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.",3
7dcfc80,"Although it seems tempting and futuristic in theory, driverless cars would be a headache legally and financially and grow Americans accustomed to technology taking over everyday activities even more than it already is. There are too many details that factor into who takes the blame for a car accident. Who is at fault for the accident is usually one driver or the other, and adding the vehicle to the equation as a culprit if it were to malfunction would make it that much more difficult to come to a conclusion.

Deciding who takes the blame and foots the bill for a car accident is already a legal and financial nightmare for those involved, and implementing driverless cars regularly would result in the car manufacturers and the drivers pointing fingers at each other and may drag out the legal process even more and put the drivers through more grief. Who untimately decides who takes the blame? Regular, driver required cars malfunction everyday and it is difficult even then to come to a conclusion. The passage states that new laws would be needed to cover liability in the case of a car accident involving driverless cars, which would require more funds. It seems like this is creating more problems than it is solving.

Modern technology tends to take over regular activities in our everyday lives, so much so that we can almost be replaced at the touch of a button. Having a sense of control and manual operation is very important. It's a matter of pride, and there's not much pride in having our computers do everything for us. According to the text, the cars would have features that tell us when to take over and operate the vehicle to execute a minor maneuver. The driver would need to be alert anyways. Advocating for awareness on the road, only to invent something takes over all operation is a bit of a condradiction. Driverless cars would only aid in the progression of an era in which man isn't really useful for much anymore. Man makes technology, not the other way around.

There are too many semantics and things that could go wrong with driverless cars on the road. Americans should stick to cars that they fully operate to ensure safety and legal ease if something were to go wrong. Growing used to technology doing everything for us is not healthy and is not something we should be proud of. ",4

In the passage ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author talks about the dangers that exploring Venus brings along with it. The author supports this idea well by sharing the pros and cons of going there.

Although there are many risks, it could help scientists better understand how common Venus and Earth are. The author states that Venus' ""temperatures average over 800 degree Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" These conditions are very extreme for any human because we aren't exposed to that type of heat and pressure at any discovered place on Earth. However, in the fourth paragraph, he says that Venus might have been ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" and that it ""still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" Although these reasons are good for scientific purposes, the risk poses a huge threat for the way that NASA chooses to explore Venus.

The author supports this idea of exploring Venus very well by giving both pros and cons for exploration. They give facts about the climate there while also giving examples of how to avoid these dangers. He knows that Venus has value so the shouldn't stop them from finding out more from this cloud-draped world. ",2
7b6d47d,"Dear, State Sentor

I feel that you should change to the popular vote for the President of the United States. That way they people can really choose who they want to be president instead of the government having to jump in and help the people choose who they want as president and some people dont vote because they know it doesnt matter.

With Electoral College the voters don't vote for a president, they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. For example the Jhon Kerry ''voting'' if you were in Texas you voted for a slate of 34 Democratic electors that pledged to John Kerry. The Electoral College is a process that makes voting easier for the government. They have to select electors, then they all have a meeting to vote for the President and Vice President, and then the counting of the eletoral votes by congress. It consists of 538 electors. But a major of 270 electroal votes in order to elect the President. Another example John F. Kennedy had a popular that vote would have went to him.

The Electoral college is unfair to voters,because of the winner-take-all system in each state, the candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, which focuses only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. It as become unfair,outdated,and irratonal. The electoral college is widely regared as an anachronism. We are in need of a change because this has been going on for years and years. So why not change it up i think it should have been done a while ago but it never to late.

The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. Which is not every fair some people are'nt as rih as others so they sould'nt descrimate people by the way they look or dress. Because for all you know they look gurst so your not going to try and listen or understand where they came from. But they could be President material they just dont have the outter look, that everyones looking for.""Don't judge a book by it cover.""

The swing states go through the most with the electoral college,because its a winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates as seen in election. Voters in toss up states are more likely to payclose attentionto the campaign. They get the most feed back for the government. Also they get attention from the candidates as while. The bigger states dont get much attention.    ",3
d744efa,"Some people may think that the Face is not a natural landform but I am here to give you reasons why the Face IS a natural landform. The reasons I am going to give you are going to be in the paragraphs below, hope you like it and think

''which opinion is better in this essay?''.

The first reason the Face is a natural landform is because 25 years ago something happened on Mars, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship ''Viking 2'', but when the camera spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face, then they saw an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a fregion of the Red Planet called '' Cydonia''.

Another reason that the Face is a natural landform is because after a few days , NASA unveiled the image which had shadows forming the illusion of eyes, nose and the mouth. But since it became so popular, the picture has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, etc. They also said that defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. But scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact.

The last reason is that thousands of anxious people were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform. But not everyone believed that.

The camera on board MGS had to peer thrrough wispy clouds to see the face, they say perhaps alien markings were hidden by a haze. People are also saying, ''We just dont pass over the face very often''.

But not everyone can be right because some people think its not a natural landform because it could be just a haze from something that was there at that specific moment and time to show that the face was there when it could have really been just a rock and not the Face after all. More reasons to this is that,even though it looked like a face...it couldnt have been, people couldve just seen the face that wasnt really there.

In Conclusion, people have different opinions on what they see and what they dont see in certain pictures. Some people see the face, some people dont see the face at all and that can be a good thing and a bad thing for some people who have different things to say about a certain subject. The Face couldve just been a rock in some peoples opinions, but some people think that it wasnt just a rock, it was an outline of a face.      ",3

I my self personally like the fact that the driver does not have to drive the car all the time. I think it would be a good idea for handicapped people.

I do not think it is a good idea for many reasons. It states in the article that the cars are eqqipted with a gps, but what if there is a current construction or hazard in the route it takes you? How will the car beable to pass another car on a two lane highway? How about drunk drivers? If a drunk wants to get in a car and drive, that car would allow it, but whenever it is time for the driver to take over, 99.9% of the time that will not happen.

I think there will always be manuel driven cars and trucks around. If someine needs to tow something a driverless car would not be able to tow anything. Farmers, personal buissness' and many other people would have a big issue with this.

Although the world is nearly going to all electronics, mechanics will have to go back to school to learn about these new cars. Most manuel driven cars never have peoblems on the road, because everything is mechanical. Switching everything over to an electronic sensor will mess everyone up. If a laser goes out for surroundings around the car, the driver cannot do anything to help it.

Driverless cars is a bad idea. Drunk drivers will be a huge hazard. Along with many other road hazards. I think it is a good idea for handicapped people, and disabled people.                    ",3
0b5c44b,"Alien comics are the real deal?

The average conspiracy theorist might think the picture of the ""Face"" was created by aliens but science and reasearch shows otherwise. Many people connect space with aliens but it's all really fiction. Everyone wants to believe that those comics and fairytales they used to read when they were younger are actually real. So any piece of information from mars that could be the slightest bit connected to earth makes everyone go bananas! Here is why your ideas and the rest of the conspiracy theorist ideas Are way off.

First, How are you putting out their ideas and beliefs but we have yet to see you guys give any evidence whats so ever. See, The team at NASA has actually done research and it's our job. When we went out to the sight where the ""Face"" is located Us and other scientists figure it was just another Martian mesa, Also, these are common around cydonia, Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Next, If this accusation was in deed Truthful why in the world would we hide this from anyone!? It would honestly help us and make us even more financially stable.

Even when we revealed the picture it engaged many common citizens and it attracted attention to mars. So, even if the whole alien thing was true it would really benfit the people. Not only are they going to learn about possibly Alive aliens but they get to learn even more about mars and how they function in space.

Also, We've provided all the evidence that we possibly can. We even went back out to The sight and took pictures again to prove these you and the rest of the conspiracy thoerists wrong. When we went back out to the sight we used a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!

Now you and many might say ""Well i still don't think their telling the truth, their probably hiding something because it might discredit them and their business.""

Well, NASA and the rest of the scientist have done all we can. Our job is to explore space and find new things that might help us on earth. So, after all the reseach we've done. Plus all the trips we've made back out there to provide the community with evidence and pictures and you guys still don't believe us thats your problem. When conspiracy theorist provide us with 100 percent credible and sufficent information then we can look into it more but for now you guyses Arguement is full of opinions.

In conclusion, This is how you and the rest of the conspiracy theorist ideas are very false and irrelevant. NASA has been in business for awhile now and we like to be looked at as very honest, diligent and hardworking people. We do not at all appreciate you and you team degrading us. We spend thousands and thousands of dollars each mission just so we can have evidence and Information that is accurate. We take our jobs very seriously. After speaking with you today i hope you can rethink your ideas and your beliefs because we've done everything we could to provide you and the rest of the people with good sources to support our decision and our arguement.

4a3a4a4,"I have an opinion that I know others will agree with extremely. By popular vote, we should change the election process to The People voting directly. According to my knowledge, the Electoral College isn't fair to voters. I know that many people such as, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFC-CIO agree with me on this. For instance, in the second passage on the first paragraph, it says that and much more. ""They're not alone [Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter...]; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore - thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College - won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Suggesting by what this satement says, a lot of people disagree with our system of election. We should be able to vote directly ourselves and not have electors do it for us. How do we know we can trust them? Yes, they're a part of our government, but that doesn't mean a thing.

The Electoral College was originally founded to be exactly what it is today; a vote that is held in Congress that is made by popular vote by citizens. But it has changed more than you think.  In article one in the 6th paragraph, it tells exactly how the Electoral College is run. ""The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in Novemeber. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" This paragraph is saying that the person you vote for is basically supposed to be voted for by his electors. In the second  article, what the author is saying is that even though this certain person will get popular vote, they won't agree with it and they'll go against the votors decisions. This isn't the right thing, obviously. I'm sure that no one knows for a fact that's true though. Even though, this is still a messed up way to vote. This country is about freedom and the right to do what we'd like, as long as it's rational. This is not rational. We need to be able to vote independentley.

There are many things wrong with this aspect of our government. Even though people don't think much of it, we're being treated unfairly. In the second article, in paragraph 2, Plumer (the author) makes a very good point. ""Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This makes us realize that we don't know who, for a fact, the electors are. It also shows that we don't know who the electors will vote for. Usually, they would probably vote for the person that were made to vote for.

None of us know what goes on in the Electoral College. We don't know if they vote for who we tell them to vote for. We don't know if they practically cheat us from getting the president we want. In article one, paragraph 8, there is something that the governor does that maybe is supposed to reassure us. ""After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Cerificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors.""  This is just them saying who was all voted for and who all ran. It also says who the electors were. They give us this probably just to notify us but maybe it's also an idea to make us think that Electoral College is proud to help us get who we want. As I have said through this whole letter, we deserve to directly vote for our President. This isn't fair to us or the person we want elected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ",5

I dont think that we should have driverless cars because anything could go wrong. The driver might miss their turn to take over the car and they could crash. There could be something that goes wrong with the computer system, and the car just goes out of control. It could go swerving all over the street and driver might not be able to take control of the wheel. There could be anything that goes wrong, and like the article said who do we blame for it? The driver or the manufacturer?

When our teens grow up and start to drive and everything they wont even know the importance of driving. Its gonna be like they only need to learn the little basic stuff because most of the time the car will be driving its self. I think its importanat that they drive on their own so that they will have expierence with driving. Teens should know that driving is really importanat. Also self driving cars will give teens an excuse for texting and driving.

The people in our society is lazy they dont like to do anything. Most people hate having to drive. That just gives everyone another reason to be lazy and not have to do anything. You can easily just sit in the acr and let it drive you. Plus i feel like it would take up alot of gas. THe people woul probably even forget how real driving actually is. There will be more laziness.

Thats just some of the reasons why I think that we shouldnt have driverless cars. Yes, there are some positive things about having them, but i dont think thatys even right to have them at all. No teens learning the importance, More lazy people, possibly more accidents also. I just think that we should keep it how it is now, people driving their cars.            ",3
ccc4a3b,"State senator.....Keeping the Electoral College would greatly benifit our country.  The electoral process is a very important process that is needed.  The Electoral College consists of 538 electors.  With majority of 270 votes are needed so there is a good chance of getting a fair shot to win.  Each candidate running for president in a state has to have there own group of electors which eguals out the odds.  The electors are chosen by the candidates political party.  In most states they have a winner takes all system but Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportion.

The certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning presidental candidate in the state and shows which electors will be representing your state at the metting of the electors which helps us to know who had won the presidental election.  Voting for a state election of who will turn elected for president. When voting you would have to vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors to pledge for Kerry.

Voting for a president is like voting for a state elector.  Even though a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it has only happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.  The reason is that the winning candidate shares the Electoral College invariably exceeds his shares of the popular vote.  The Electoral college requires an apresidental candidate to have transregional appeal.

The residents of the other religions are likely to feel disenfranchised and that their votes does not count and that the new president will have know regard for their interests.  That he is not really there president.  The winner of all methods of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates like as seen in the election of 2012.  They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters on average and that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidate as the most thoughful voter should be the one to decide the election.

The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constituion.  Having the electoral College avoids the problem of electiong in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.  It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potental voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, Democrats in Texas for example or Republicans in California.

Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.  As some would say the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  The best arguments in favor of it are most likely assertions without much basis in reality.     ",1
daf7b23,"When ever a president gets elected in the United States of America, the votes that they recieve are from the electoral college process. The electoral college has 538 electors, each state in the United States of America has a certain amount of voters, one state might have more than others. For example, The state of California and Texas have the most votes throughout the whole country.

Some people don't really agree with the electoral college process because they belive that if you vote you are voting for electors of your state that eventually vote for you at the end. For example, if you lived in Texas and you wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. And everyone's question might be ""who are those electors?' The electors can be anyone not holding public office. That's why there's a 60% vote against the electoral college.

The electoral college is widely looked at as a person, a non-democratic way of selecting a U.S president that is going to be overruled by saying the canidate who recieves the most popular votes is the winner. It is the electors that elect the presidents, not the people. But each party selects a slate of elector's trusted to vote for the party's nominee, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral votes doesn't win the popular votes. This happened in 2000, when gore had more popular votes, but yet he had less electoral votes than George Bush.

I think the electoral college is a fantastic method of electing the United States of America's president, because for instance, let's say a person older than 18 who is allowed to vote and knows nothing about politics goes ahead and votes for the presidential canidate that has better hair, or maybe because he's taller, or he has a nice voice, then the next thing you know that the president knows absolutely nothing about the government or politics and votes a president based on their outside characteristics and not by the presidents knowledge or his intelligence or ability of helping the country out. And it's sad because at the end of the day the president that they chose can become so mean, rude,and clueless of what he/ she's doing. So then at the end we the people are stuck with bad leader for example, like Cuba, and north Korea and other harsh leader that are the president or maybe even  country regret having that disrespectful person that they chose just becasue of his characteristics on the outside instead of paying attention to the presidential canidates knowledge, and thats why we should still stick with the electoral college method.            ",3

To begin, a benifit of limiting our car usage is fuel pollutes the air by circulating green house gasses that can cause a dangerous enviroment to form and by limiting cars we limit this pollution. With President Obama's issue to decrease the amount of air pollution caused by cars, many have realized that car usage is not as common as it used to be. If the number of cars on the road continues to deplete- ""and many sociologists believe it will-it will have benificial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"" (Rosenthal source 4) says Rosenthal in her article ""The End of Car Culture."" By keeping track and trying to deplete the time you spend driving your car the trend of putting air pollution to an end will increase.

Additionally, a benifit of limiting our car usage is being able to use the cheaper and more efficient alternate means of transportation. By using alternate means of transportation such as buses, trains, and car pooling services you are saving gas money and supporting community business'. There is a rise in car pooling that has ""facilitated more flexable commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" (Rosenthal source 4) says Rosenthal. As these changes manifest many people are chosing not to switch back to driving themselvs.

Finally, a benifit of limiting our car usage can be found in the better communionship that will result as cities will make their stores closer together and communities more closley knit. In Bogota, Colombia people are practicing ""car-free days"" and relying solely on public transportation. As this happens author of article ""Care-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" Andrew Selsy, says ""parks and sports centers [are] bloom[ing] throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (Selsky source 3). Other places implementing car-free districts will never hear the roars of engines drowning out the chirping of the birds or childrens laughter. Infact, stores and public transportation is stratigically placed a walking distance away thus promoting social and physical benifits (Rosenthal source 1).

The advantages of limiting car usage include fuel will no longer pollute the air, alternate transportation is available and cheaper, and it would enforce goodwill and communionship. With greenhouse gasses rapidly circulating and polluting the globe it would be acceptional to decrease this by not driving as often. Furthermore, by using alternate transportation such as car pooling or taking a bus money is saved on gas and car repairs. Finally, goodwill and good social habits would increase as towns would become more closley knit as everything would only be a walk away. With this it we should limit our car usage to ""save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve saftey"" (Rosenthal source 4).

6b4e56f,"Driverless cars can be dangerous to use for many reasons. I am against driverless cars for many reasons. The driver of the car might not be alert when they need to be, the car could cause a crash, Also it could do the wrong thing at the wrong time. Theres many more reasons but those are the main ones.

When driving a driverless car the driver of the car must be alert at all times. If the driver feel asleep behind the wheel thinking its okay because the car drives itself something bad could happen. Some people are heavy sleepers and might not wake up if the seat just vibrate and that can cause a serious car crash. Also if someone is paying attention to something else like their phones or maybe children in the back seat something can easily happen when it is the drivers turn to drive and they aren't paying attention to the road or whats going on becuase they depend on the car to do everything.

Another reason why driverless cars are dangerous is because it could cause a crash. If the car isn't alert when it's sudden road changes or if something instantly happen like a crash infront of it then thedriverles car could crash along with it. Also if its construction work and the car doesnt know about it the car might just take the wrong turn or go where its not supposed to go because it didnt know the sudden change of whats going on. Also if the driver is expecting the car to kow what to do the driver might react late to the sudden changes and the car might just drive off the road or somewhere its not supposed to be. Also if the traffic laws change and the car doesnt know it could run into another car and do something that could hurt the driver and other passengers.

The last reason driverless cars are dangerous is because it could do the wrong thing at the wrong time. Lets say something happens to the car or the cameras on it or radar gets damaged and now the car can't tell the difference between the yellow or green light. The car could easily speed up when it's time to slow down and cause a crash with another car. The driverless car also might not know whats going on when people are at stop signs. It could be the other persons right away and the car might go and cause a crash to happen.Also someone could push the brake and the car probaly thinks it should keep going to it might and cause a serious car crash.

That's the main reasons why driverless cars are dangerous. They can cause something bad to happen, Th driver of the car might not be alert when they need to be and the car could do the wrong thing at the wrong time. All these reasons could lead to a car crash which could cause the people in the car to die. Thats why I am agaisnt driverledd cars.",4
a34d55c,"Dear Senator,

I am here today to strongly persuade you to keep in favor of the Electoral College process. Why you ask? Well, the swing states process is when most voters pay attention to the campaign which makes the candide work harder in supporting their argument, and avoiding run-off elections where the election process is greatly complicated but which is avoided by the Electoral College process. This is why I strongly believe that you should keep the process of the Electoral College.

In the swing states process the candidates to focus their campain efforts on the toss-up states. Which makes voters most likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make them really want to know that they are going to decide on their elections. ""They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates)"" by, Richard A. Posner also states that the most thoughful voter should be the ones to decide the winner of the election.

Lastly, Avoiding run-off elections which is greatly pressured when no candidates wins the majority of the vast cast but is reduced by the Electoral College. Ya sure, It can be argued that this method of choosing the president can turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no intention of carrying their state but, is picked up by voters by paying attention to their campagn which is like the swing states process.

Furthermore, due to the swing states process is when most voters pay attention to the campaign and for the candidates to work harder at then making them wanting to here their argument. The Run-off elections process which is greatly pressured when no candidates wins the majority of the vast cast but is reduced by the Electoral College. Yes, Mr. Senator, I strongly infavor of keeping the Electoral College process because of these very important statements why and without it the voting process would be extremly  difficult.                    ",3
aab18b3,"""New high resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" the author says in ""Unmasking the Face on Mars."" NASA has taken more than just one photo of the face over a period of 25 years.

Taking a closer look at the photos of the Face on Mars, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Priogram, Garvin says, ""What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" Garvin makes this statement after he discerns the picture in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" he added.

""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Garvin says. ""So, if there were objects in this picture such as airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

""The face on mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows."" the author says in paragraph 5 of the artice. The face has gone public, showing pictures to web surfers. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing... a natural landform."" says paragraph 7. ""There was no alien monument after all.""

High-resolution images and 3D altimery from NASA's MGS spacecraft gives us evidence that the Face on Mars is in fact, not created by aliens. There has been multiple sitings of the face by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. The pictures that came back to NASA were analized and they were found the face to be a natural landform. ",2
723792b,"Keeping the Electoral College is not smart for the united states voting system. First, many citizens all over the country don't agree with the voting system. Second, the Electoral College may be swayed by bias. Third, citizens do not really have control over their vote. The Electoral College system should be changed.

Many American citizens do not agree with the voting system. Citizens have grievances about the system being unfair and unreasonable. The Office of the Federal Register states, ""It's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality"" (source 1). If American citizens are persistant with the issue, and continue to argue, then why is the government keeping the system? Why doesn't the government come up with a more rational voting system?

The Electoral College's vote may be swayed by bias. How can we trust total strangers with our vote? Bradford Plumer states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states (source 2). Voters do not get the full effect of voting because they are voting for other ""qualified"" people to vote for them. How is that possibly effective?

Citizens do not have control over their vote. Once citizens vote their vote is out of their hands. The Electoral College chooses the president for them and there is nothing citizens can do about it. Bradford Plumer states, ""Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidential election"" (source 2). The government has full control over how the election goes, not the citizens who voted.

The entire Electoral College system is completely irrational. The government needs to come up with a new way to vote for future presidents that is more fair. If we find a solution to this problem the government will not only gain favor of the American citizens, but also keep the balance that is established by the constitution. The American citizens will have control over their vote. The Electoral College should be abolished.    ",4
c0d6389,"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by explaining how fascinating Venus truly is and how there are ways of getting around the hazards involved. The author goes into detail about how Venus is so fascinating because it is our Earth's ""twin"". Although there are numerous safety hazards for the space travelers, NASA has developed many theories on how to get around it. With this he is able to support his view that studying Venus up close would be benefitial despite the dangers at hand.

Venus is one of the closest planets to resemble Earth in the entire solar system. The author states, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size..."" This is the author's way of introducing the idea that other planets in our solar system could have been able to harbor some form of life at some point. The author also states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" The author uses these excerpts in order to explain to the reader why there is such a fascination with studying Venus and why he supports it.

Venus has its fair share of deadly hazards including erupting volcanos, atomic pressure beyond what any human can stand, intense heat and many more serious hazards. The author states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray...a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way...Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author includes this to show that although Venus has it's dangers there are ways to get around them, he does this in order to support ,or convince the reader, that studying Venus would be more important than the possible dangers.

In conclusion, the author supported his belief that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers excellently. The author explains that Venus could have once been exactly like Earth and even now Venus is the closest to resembling Earth. He explained that there are indeed many safety hazards but with NASA working on ways around these hazards, the trip would be worth it, even if it's just from a bird's-eye view. ",4
92eb5d8,"You know how in the old cartoons like the jetsons and etc , fantasize the future with flying cars and travel tubes. I think this is the next step to living like the Jetsons. You can drive your car with out really driving; Who wouldnt like to do that? But with everything thats good theirs always a bad side and their have been many concerns about these new self driven cars. I personally dont think that we are ready for this kind of technology.

"" Something not available to drivers trying to text and drive with a cell phone"" (paragraph 8).

We cant even pay attentions in the cars we have because we are to busy trying to be on our phones 24/7. America alone has had a numerous amount of accidents in the past couple of years and alot of them end in fatality. With a car that you dont have to be focused on 24/7 will probably just make matters worse. America is jsut simply not ready to keep their hand on the steering wheel and off their screens.

""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" ( Paragraph 9). This big what if question, what if the technology forgets to remind the driver that its their turn to drive. What if the system over corrects the car and causes an accident. What if the sensors stop sensing. Their are alot of plausable ""what ifs"" with these cars. Personally, a little bit too many what ifs. These producers should just wait till they can assure most of these issues will never happen. Plus, most of these cars will be so expensive so no one will really be able to drive them in the general population. So a waste of money and product for a car to sit some where in a ware house, rusting away.

The people of America are not ready for these "" Self drivin cars""

to be out on the street. First we have to make sure we can drive without the cars help safetly then go from their. The development on these cars need to be holted until they can assure most of the problems that might occur. But if they do make a model with none of these concerns im all for the""Self driven auto mobiles"".              ",3

7348136,"In 1976 NASA got a blury camera shot which kinda looked like a face. Then they relised that the face on mars needs to be looked at agine. In 1998 NASA sent another ship to look at the face on mars agine. This time it loooked differnt is kinda looks more clearer than the other one. Then when they took back the pictuers of they face they were amazed what had happened to it.

In 2001 NASA sent more people to get pictures of the face with better camura. When the picuters returned to NASA they were stuned. The face looked so much differnt than the pictuer in 1998 it looked like somthing hit it. Then when the people came back to earth they heard about the news and the picture got released into the public. Then something happened someone leared that it was not a face on mars it's just a rock building.

When NASA learned that it was just a rock building they started to loose hope with the face on mars but, something werid happend. When the wired thing happend they wanted to know what happend? When they saw the pictures they noticed that half of the face was smashed. Then they pointed out agine that the face was destryed but it still waan't really a face it was agine a stone builing. Then there was still no hope to find the face in the desert.

After that there was the last trip to see if the face on mars was a face or a stone building?

When they got to mars they took pictures and tryed to see if they could take a picture of it to close. Then they relesed that it only really was a rock building or thing. When they learned that they stared to give up on the subject and just forget about it. Then when there was only a littel group of people who still think there something on mars they kept on going and never give up.

When they got really close to mars they noticed something it looked like a face but they could not be sure. When they got even closer they found the face on mars and they was very happy for themselves. After they came back to earth they told everyone that they found the face on mars. Then people tried to understand what they said beacuse they were told that there was no face on mars. After all that the face on mars is still there this very day and time and people want to see it in person like feet on mars and see the face on mars",2
ace59f1,"In Paragrph 1 sentence 1 it says that somrtimes Pluto is called ""Evening star. However its nickname is misleading since Venus is actually a planet. In our solar system Venus is the second planet from our sun. While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth , it has provide a very challenging place to examine more closely .

In paragrph 2 Venus is somrtimes often referred to as Earth's ""Twin"" Venus is the closet planet to Earth In terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth Venus, and Mars, are other planetary neighbor.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbron dioxide blankets Venus. The clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere. On the planets surface, tempertures can average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit , and the atmospheric preesure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anthing humans encounter on Earth such an eviorment would crush even a submarine accustomsed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans .

The Nationnal Aeronautics and space Administartion (NASA) has one particuar compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.

NASA is working on othe approaches that Pluto might be a planet or a star. In the 1800s

NASA was still studyimg in the 1940s during World War 2. The tought of compuetrs exisiting in those days ,but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electrions at all.

NASA is striving to meet the challege presneted by Venus has value , not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itslef ,but also because human curiosty will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors .

Pluto is a planet according to NASA. Since Pluto is a planet Pluto is dangerous because Pluto can cause problems to the atmosphere and it can cause harm to our sister planet and it can cause the sun to give Earth more sun and really hot heat and we would have to turn the ac on high.

Pluto can be very tough to study as well because pluto can be a planet one momemt and a star the next and NASA somrtimes give us the wrong information sometime. Earth has a lot of preesure ,heat and other forcers that Earth is responbile for and Earth cant do Everthing by itself beacause Earth needs backup from other planets.

Through the time I've been here I've already helpped many animals get to the place they need to be at. Since I helpped out my aunt Katie on her farm it was easy to help the animals on bord. If you would join the Seagoing Cowboys program I could help you with anything you need, that involes the animals. If this is the only reason why you're sighning up, then you're in for more than what you expected.

Travel over seas and vist many places that include Itly, China, and many more. Even if you almost go over bord it's still worth being on the boat, unless you grew up around baots and can stay on bord if it's a bad storm. It's hard being a Seagoing Cowboy believe me I know, but it can be fun no matter what happens.

You can have fun with the others when we are on return trips we can play many sports that we want, since we don't have the animals. Even if we have the animals we can find somethings that are fun on the boat. To me it's fun already with or without the animals, because there are always people by your side, and you never get lonely.

If you do join there will be plenty of fun things to do I can't count them all, but I'm sure you can find something to do.

I hope you do end up joining very soon I can't wait to see all the new faces on bord. Even though there are plenty thing to do, it can still get very boring here. I can't wait to see all of you being part of the Seagoing Cowboys.",3

67ea13c,"Driverless cars can be used as an advantage in the following ways. There is a substantial amount of usefulness in the medical field with driverless cars. The mentally disabled in many ways can have a new type of freedom. Overall driverless cars are more safe.

The medical field is advancing rapidly. The transportion for hospitals, health clinics, in home nursing etc., can be greatly efected in a positive way. In an emergency situation a patient does not have a moment to spare, and a driverless ambulance does not spare a single second. The driverless ambulance will send out a signal pulling over all other driverless cars, leaving an open path, and another patient with thier life. The medical personel can have all hands on the patient. The driverless car is more effecient in the medical field than a manual car.

The mentally disabled strive to be more independant, and what better way than giving themselves thier own transportation. Granted they could take the bus, but the driverless car is infiantly safer for them. The people that care for them can take driving them to the doctors off of their checklist. In an emergency all they have to do is tell the car where to go and it will asist them. Once again the driverless car can save lives.

The main point of the driverless car is to be a safer alternative to the manual version. The built in automatic brakes have already been proven useful in todays vehicles. Built in GPS systems can be of great value when all a human has to do is type in a location. A human mind turns to panic in an accident, but not the computer program of the driverless car. The driverless car can save lives.

The driverless car can save lives. The driverless car can grant a new sources of freedom and independece to the mentally disabled.

67532a2,"The U.S. has been using the Electoral College for a long time.  I believe it would be a good idea to keep it, I mean why would you change something that still works?  Now unless you want to make it a better process it should stay the way it is.  I dont think popular vote would get us a good president, people would pick the one who makes those promises that will only be good for a short time.  The U.S. needs a president who can asure us we wont have to worry about everybody losing there jobs soon or not being able to pay for gas because its up to $4.00 a gallon.

Its a very time managed process, its not like they take some names, write them on a piece of paper, mix them up in a hat, and grab the first one you feel.  How big of a mistake would that be? Electoral College even sounds like a well thought out idea, for one it has the word college in it and college is where you get a better education for your future.  When electing a President you want to know that you will have a good future with the president that is elected.  Just because the Electoral College is old doesnt mean it isnt a good process.

Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.  Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. ( So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actuallt gone to Kennedy.)

Voting for the next President of the United States isn't something you would just want to rest in the hands of popular votes, you could end up with someone who doesnt even know what he is doing, or even desides he can't handle all of the responsibility of being the President.  I feel very strong about my thoughts on the subject and believe that the Electoral College is still the way to go.               ",3
eb1e42c,"Have you heard of ""The Face on Mars""? Do you believe that it is said to be created by aliens? Have you been told that it was said to resemble an Egyptian Pharaoh? We will find out whether or not this ""Face"" is created by aliens or just some sort of landform.

There has not been any evidence or information that aliens excist. These landforms are common around Cydonia. The usual shadows made it out to look like an Egyptian Pharoah. We thought it was important to taxpayers, so we took another photo when we could get a good shot in. We snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origanal, but still, nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. This is just one factor that the ""Face"" was not created by aliens.

Recently in 2001, we took a picture so maximized that we would have seen something. We did not. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras maximum resolution. You can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. If there were objects in the picture such as Egyptian-style pyramids or small shacks, we would have seen what they are. Our maximized picture from Mars Global Surveyor helped provide facts to prove that it was not created by extraterestrial life.

The ""Face"" is similar to mesas' around the American west. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or a mesa. Garvin states that it even reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake RIver Plain of Idaho. He says it is a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as ""The Face on Mars"". With this fact we have proven that it is just a landform.

Since ""The Face on Mars"" is not really created by aliens and is just a natural landform, we can only hope for different evidence that aliens do excist. No evidence in our photos showed up that there are aliens. The photo taken by the MGS has also proven no excistence of alien life. When we found out that it resembled an American mesa, we knew that was all it was. Our ""Face on Mars"" is only a landform, but that does not mean we can not look for things that are not.",4
07845e1,"What do you think the face on Mars is? A natural landform or made by aliens? Most people think the so called ""Face on Mars"" is formed by aliens. I believe otherwise because, landforms on Earth are like that and these assumptions are made by conspircy theorist not by NASA officals. now here are my reasons.

The face on Mars is made by natural landforms and not by aliens. One thing of evience by a picture by Mars Global Surveyor, in paragraph 7 it says ""...anxious web surfers we're waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"" That's a big piece of evidence that it's not made by aliens. Also, my second piece of evience that supports that the face on Mars is not made by aliens in paragraph 12 is ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the Amerian West"". ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" That's my first reason I believe that the face on Mars is landform made.

The fact that conspriacy theorist make the assumption of the face on Mars is made by aliens. You have to understand that those remakes are not all true they are just theories which is just provided by evience but, not always right. In paragraph 5 it says ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of like on Mars-evidencd that NASA woud rather hide, say conspiracy theroists."" ""meanwhile defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" That evidence was never what NASA said that's conpiracy theorist said and it's not true. So, mark these words and think about your decision, i think you should change you're mind about the alien theory to a natural landform with this information.

The ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" from the evidence is that it's a landfrom instead of aliens making these faces on Mars. Don't always go by what the internet or media says, go by what real experts say. Maybe, you people that think that it's made by aliens I hope my reasonings and evidence is strong enough to change you're mind. Now what do you think of my evidence did it change your mind?             ",4
5e5a139,"I'm wanting to tell you that the Face on Mars, that NASA found, is just a natural landform. When NASA first found it, they all thought it was a human face, but it's not.

NASA also thinks that there was egyptain pryamids, that humans created. NASA is disagreeing with a lot of people, saying that humans onced live on mars, and that when they lived there they created all of those thing. Another thing why I am thinking and telling you it is a natural landform, is because not one single person could live on Mars, that long to build anything on it. We all know the reason why people can't live on Mars, well if you don't know then let me tell you, it is because of all the weather they have, and all the big bad wind and dust storms they have.

There is no possible way that a human could of built this in that short amount of time it had been there. Another reason why I am telling that it is a natural landform, is because, a human couldn't have built one of these things, because it sometime takes almost up to years to create things like these. Because of the wind Mars couldn't have all those human like features.

Thats why I am telling you, and you can disagree with me all you want to, but i'm telling you that i'm right, and that no person could ever live that long on a planet, that can't even have any hum possibly live on it. ",3
df99bf2,"There are many people that believe that the ailens bulid the structures that are on Mars, but many don't have reasons on why they think that. There are many reason why aliens bulit the structure but not very good reasons. While there is scientificly proven facts and statements that the aliens did not build the structures and that it is all natural landform.

Many people believe that the aliens bulit the structure but they are wrong, there's no alien building something so we can capture its making. Just like on the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" sentence 7 it says, ""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking Photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The first time the Viking took the pictures the camera didn't have the good resoultion that the camera had now, so it looked like a face or alien monument but really it was just some natural landscape.

Although there are credible information, there is just people who don't believe the information. They think it really was aliens building the monuments/structures. Like it says on sentence 5 ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" Meaning that the conspiracy theorists believe that it is NASA trying to hide the real evidence on the aliens. They think NASA is trying to trick them and they are not falling for it. But whar they don't have is credible resourses like NASA does.

Now that technology has become a lot better NASA could now use a better camera for better pictures for the natural landscape on Mars. Like it says on sentence 11 ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" says Gavin, this is saying that now that they have a camera that is 3 times better they could now see things much more clearly and better and all the natural landscape there is.

In counclusion, the structures that were seen on Mars are really just natural lanscape just like when it says on sentence 12, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-- landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" says Gavin, this is comparing the Middle Butte to the natural landscape on Mars because it's saying that landscapes do have things in common like how they are naturally made by, the planet it's on.

e4c1fa1,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile' it talks about how you can tell a students emotion from a new technology called the Facial Action Coding. Would you want a computer reading your face? or knowing how you feel? I actually don't think that is necessary. Why? because some people want all their feelings to be kept to themselevs, does'nt want the computer or the teacher knowing what's going on with them, or is'nt even comfortable with even letting a computer tell your emotions. I know I would'nt because technology is too much and can make up so many things about you.

First reason, why I feel that technology shouldnt be used in a classroom to tell how you feel because some people want to keep all of their emotions to themselves. Nobody wants technology to show them the percentage of how they feel, to make them maybe more upset then what they are. If a student is more angry than happy the teacher might start asking questions wondering why. The student didnt want anyone to know. Its like the technology would be taking over the students space.

Second, a teacher should'nt know personally why a student is feeling a type of way. Unless the student is willing to tell the teacher. Instead, of being forced to be told bc the technology is telling your emotions and how you feel. The computer constructs a 3-D model of your face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like the human muscles. The Facial Action coding is all in your body controlling your emotions.

Last reason, I think why it shouldn't be used or is'nt valuable is not being comfortable with the Facial Action Coding knowing their emotions. The creator Dr. Paul Eckaman, came up with six basic emotins. The different emotions he came up with is happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Also, each characteristic movement of the facial muscles. Technolgy reading how I feel, but definitly not in a classroom it is not the time or place to see how someone feels.

In conclusion, so basically I feel like you should'nt have to d it in a classroom. Maybe if you are outside of school, in a doctor office it'll be more comfortable. In class using the technology of Facial Action Coding is not where you should use it, it isnt valuable in a classroom. Eventhough, you could tell how someone feels by looking at their face sometimes, does'nt mean you use technology to see all your emotions. So, I disagree with is being used in classrooms. ",3
87cff96,"Dear Senator PROPER_NAME,

As you are well aware, elections in the United States are of extreme importance. Therefore, it is vital to have the best system possible when electing officials. Maintaining the current system of Electoral College would be a fatal mistake to our country. We must elect canidates by poular vote alone.

According to the articele

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Pulumer, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Beccause of the winner-take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" Americans who are voting the the next president should have the right to hear what canidates have to say. They may be the only one in their state who is not a democrat, but shouln't their vote still be heard.

The article also states that, ""Perhaps most morrying is the prospect of a tie in the elctoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the Houise of Representatives, where sate delegations vote on the president."" Shouldn't the American people get to decide who their president is?! We fought a war so that we would be able to govern ourselves. If the House of Representatives are allowed to choose our president, then why did why fight the war againg Great Britain? It isn't right.

Though the article

In Defense of the Electoral Collge: Five Reasons to keep our despised methos of choosing the President sates that ""it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not be the winner of the popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely."" The opposition even admits that the President may not be who the nation wants as their leader. That should never happen.

As you see Senator, Electoral College must be abolished by any means neccessary. To keep such an unjust system goes against the very principle the America was founded on. ""We the people..."" It was not ""We the government..."" or ""We the rulers..."". How can we claim to be a nation of liberty when the citizend are unable to determine who their president should be.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME                            ",4

My name is PROPER_NAME im from a lil town called LOCATION_NAME.And I saw where you was trying to see if yall should keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Well I think you should change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

So I think you should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.Because if you elect a president by slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Thats not fare to the other person that was running, because what if the other person was winning and they lose because the slate of electors elect the person that was losing. For example Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

So Mr. Senator can you take what i told you and try and change Electoral College or change to election by popular vot e for the president of the United States. Because it's not fare to the other runner up.

Smart cars may not be ready, but smart roads are. Imagine it. A car that follows the road. Too bad it would cost billions and billions to replace every single road.

Let's say cars would be able to drive without smart road. What would happen if an accident were to accure or if there was major traffic? Would cars be able to menuver around? What about state laws? In paragraph 9, it states that in most states it is illegal even to test driveless cars. Why would that be? People claim that it would be safer to have driverless car, but would it be illegal if it was considered safe. Plus, what would be good about taking jobs away from bus and taxi drivers?

Driverless cars seem like a fantasy. Are smart cars the way to go? Or should we focus on the problems in hand? Having driverless cars would just put the country in debt.",2
189579d,"I think that we should have more control over the car. like a manual over ride so we could just drive if we dont want to use the automatic mode. the fact that a camera will be watching you kinda bothers me, and they say its for saftey. I dont belive that i think its for people who do drugs, or drink and drive so i guess it would be safer but it would also take away our freedom/choice to drive.

Im still for it cause you would also have more time to pay more attention to others in your car. honestly thats why the camera thing, making sure your watching the road is a bit counter intuitive. You would just be sitting there bacicly looking out a window not to mention people would get board and then you'd definatly get distracted. It even says its on autopilot 90 percent of the time. I hope they redesign the inside of the car, maybe have it to a more liveing room type thing where the driver seat can rotate a 180 degrees to face towards the middle of the car. there would be a adjustable table tv, computer or if you need to face and talk with your kids.

So i think this would help on time crunches and multi-tasking. when you think obout it we spend hours of our day watching signs,roads, and cars. All that time just gone with little progress of anything but now you should be able to get a lot more done in little time, cause time is everything. And we really shouldn't be wasting it on staring at a long lonly road for hours on end.",2

Driverless cars are a great way to get from point a to b without even having to touch the wheel once. You wouldn't have to worry about your driverless car being in an accident, since the manufacturers have designed it with many sensors to enhace the efficiency and quality of your car, so it can mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. There are many benefits from driverless cars, for instance you could go on a road trip and you wouldn't have to touch the wheel once. Also with driverless cars you could get many new features like in-car-entertainment and information systems that use head-up displays so the driver doesn't get bored. Other benefits are like added cameras to the car so the driver can stay focused on the road while the car drives by itself. But with many machines,eletronics, etc. There will always be many cons. Some cons of the driverless car is when it gets into a traffic jam, the driver will have to take the wheel and drive. Another con is sensors could go bad and cause the driverless car to not peform at its potential and creating hazards to other cars or pedrestians.

People are starting to realize that their happier when not riding their car, in fact Heudrun Walter mother of 2 said ""when i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Walter now can walk the streets and enjoy the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children.

Us humans rely to much on our cars for transportation, We should learn how to get to places on our own. Before we had cars we walked on our own 2 feet and didnt complain, its time for us to get back part of our humanity. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"",said David Goldenberg, an official of Transportation for America. If cars were to all of a sudden disappear would you be capable of getting around without a vechicle of transportation?

In Bogota, Colombia a program was set to have a car free day. The only way of transportation was through buses and taxis, and violators would have to pay a $25 fine. ""It was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower pollution"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Not only does not riding your car lower pollution but it can also help lower emissions, conserve resources, and improve safety. The goal is to limit car usage and to start noticing the advantages of a car free life, like walking the streets and enjoying another beautiful day.

Fellow citizens I advice you to put down you car keys and go outside to smell the clean air, see the sun shining on your face and get a breeze of how life would be from outside the windows of your car. We can help make our environment be a better place all you have to do is start taking action and realize their are more advantages to limiting car use then car usage its self.    ",3

Another resaon it is worthy to explore is that curistoy people will have to see what venus really is. Another reason it is a worthy to explore venus is how many pwople have tried but failed.

People belive that venus was exaclty like earth a long time ago scientist state that venus had oceans. In paragraph 4 it is stated that venus could even have supported forms of life just like earth.

even today venus still has some features that are analogous to earth it even incudes valleys moutains. There might be more stuff that is on earth that looks like venus that we may not have seen because we could not properly explore it becuse of the distance.

Another reason that exploring venus is not such a bad idea is because you might learn new things on that plant that could help our plant out. Plus pople will alway have curiosity to learn how venus is if it will ever be a subsitute for earth. poeple want to explore it so bad becuse it is a hard challenge but it should not be discoraged jsut because it is dangerous.

Another reason exploring venus might not be a bad idea is that poeple who see that it is a hard challenge and that no one has done it will be push to be the firsht one to land explore it better then from long distant exploring. A spacecraft has not landed or even came close to landing in venus in three decades meaning

it is dangerous but will be good for a learning lesson and exploration.each misson was unmanned so not a single real person had the oppertunity to land there becuse of how dangrous.

The author supports the idea studying venus by stating good things about what we can learn how it can help us and how hard it wil be. One reason the statement above is true becuase he states how we can learn how venus is simllar to earth. How it is difficult to land there to truly explore you have to do hard work. This represents that the author supports his idea by giving deatials about why it is worthy despite how hard or even dangrous it can be.",3
ac6cc38,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens, it is only a natural landform on Mars. It is a natural landform on Mars similar to a mesa or butte. The landform only resembles a face and was not made by aliens. Scientists have examined pictures of it and concluded it has no alien decent. The Face is a landform and was not made by aliens.

The first reason the Face is a landform is that the Face is similar to an Earthern landform like a mesa or butte. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. NASA beleives this is a rock formation and not anything else. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The Mars Face is similar to Earthern landforms, thats why it can't be an alien produced object.

In 1976 the camera photos weren't as good as they are now. The photo in 1976 isn't as reliable as the 2001 photo taken. In paragraph 7 it said, ""revealing a... natural landform."" There was no alien monument after all."" This shows that this newer photo from 1998 shows more evidence than the 1976 photo. More data can be gathered from newer photos to show that the Face is a landform.

If the Face was an alien monument, then NASA would tell people of the information to get an exploration going. They would have sent out another mission to investigate the Face. It said, ""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" This shows that NASA was as anxious as the people to try and discover new foreign life. This is why NASA would have investigated if the Face on Mars was an alien monument But it is a landform.

Some people might say that NASA is still lying about the Martian Face being alien related. Conspiracy theorists would say things like the Face is pure evidence of alien life. In paragraph 5 it said, ""the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars."" The conspiracy theorists who say this are wrong because NASA has proven that it is a landform. This is why those conspiracy theorists are wrong.

The Face on Mars is a landform. It is not alien related in any way. The scientists at NASA have proven it. NASA would not lie, they need money to fund anything so they would have to tell people. This is why The Mars Face is not alien related and is a landform.",4
ac6cc81,"There are some advantages of limiting car usage. For exampple, it can cause a lot of pollution, traffic jams in small cities, and thr greenhouse gas emissions.

First of all, the advantages of limiting car usage is pollution. The passage states that ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Meaning that, Paris had to ban driving because there was so much polution going on. Pollution is one of the biggest problems in the United States today. And most of the people argue about it when it's actually them causing all of it.

In addition, the reason why they limit car usage is because in some small countries like, Colombia can cause a lot of traffic jams. The passage states that, ""Bogota, Colombia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" also, in the passage it discussed that, ""The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota. Meaning that cars were causing all of the rain showers and that is why Colombia banned cars for one day only to decrease the traffic jam and to do somthing about the rain showers that is happening daily.

The passage states that, ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week."" Meaning that when a lot of people are using gas.                             ",3
89f5181,"Dear Senator,

Good day, I am writing this letter to let you know it's time for things to change. I have been reading and researching the Electoral College and i have a strong opinion on it. As you know, the Electoral College is a process when all five hundred and thirty eight electors vote on electors and defenders. This way of voting for electors lets the people have no say in whose running our goverment! Our goverment should not allow or be based on ""the winner takes all"" method. When we choose for OUR president we should be able to choose OUR electors too! Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. The electors shouldnt be chosen by the canidate's political party, we should choose. By voting for a president every four years a new party of electors have already been selected to run with him and we dont get any say. After the presidential election, your governer creates a list of all the canidates that ran for president in your state with a list of their representative electors. This is later sent to Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, Jimmy Carter, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agree that we need to remove and forget about the electoral college. This year our voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. Still the electoral college still has defenders fror themselves is crazy. Facts say voters arent actually voting for the president, but for a group of electors who in turn elect the president, and that is ridiculous. How are we supposed to trust these electors if we dont even know who they are and their background until after the election? Who even are these electors i wondered. I figured out that all the electors are actually anyone with a brain and not holding a public office, fantastic. So how do i know they are reliable and going to do whats best for my state and our country? Voters dont even control whom their electors vote for most of the time which is kind of scary. Some electors are even faithless in their party's canidate so they dont even vote for them at all! How can we rely on a group of people who dont rely on their party?

As much as I hate to say it, there most definitley is an upside to the Electoral College. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that needs to be overruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I personally think that is the best way to decide who gets in. Each party selects a slate of electors that are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Sometimes the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Another reason The Electoral College is a positive way of voting is how certain the outcome is. There is never failure in the counting of the votes and there us rarely a tie between two people. My favorite reason is because ""everybody is president"". This means everybody can make their own decisions and have a great amount of freedom.

Even though im all for removing the Electoral College there is positives too. In a few years when i am able to vote, i will be careful of who I vote for and make sure that there is great electors in the party i vote for.                              ",4
5924b69,"Since the car was first created there has been many innovations to different types of cars. However, studies have shown that in the last few years the percentage of people getting a license has dropped. There are many advantages in limiting car usage not only in the city but also in the suburbs.

The first of these advantages has to due with our never ending problem with our environment.  For example, as stated in source number 2 the city of Paris had been very polluted. To solve this problem the ruling party in France enforced a driving ban. After five days of this driving ban being in effect the smog in Paris had gone down by 60%. Becasue of this ban the city of Paris is a cleaner place to live now and another result of this ban is that people truly can see how much pollution these cars create.

Another advantage of limiting car use is that once these cars are gone people are much more sociable. In source 1, the government of Germany has created a suburban community where there is no cars. Car ownership is allowed however there are only two places to park and it is very expensive. Because of this 70% of families in this community do not own cars. To get around in this community you are able to walk, ride a bike, skate, etc. As a result, you do not hear cars on the streets but you do hear bike swishing and kids playing with eachother. Many studies have also shown that a day without a car is a very effective stress reliever, as stated in Source 3.

Now a world without cars is very hard to imagine because of all the different places that everybody has to get there however, there are many alternatives to using cars on a daily basis. These alternatives include public transportation, bikes, skates, walking, and also car pooling. If there is a reduction of car usage the environment will recieve a very large benefit.

As the articles provided has shown, there are many advantages to the limiting of car usage and it will not only benefit us as humans but also our environment.    ",4

To which would let the teachers be able to switch up how they teach that student . This device also uses a very reliable computer program to calculate the face muscles. This would make it the most relatable to human facial muscles.

Finally, this device has many benefits to it such as, reading emotional expressions and even telling if there faking that expression.

This use of this technology would benefit teachers by letting them know how the students feel. ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions""(D'Alto).For example lets say a student is feeling fustrated on a test, so he might show he's happy so the teacher wont come question him. The teacher can use the FACS device and understand exactly how the student is feeling. Instead of him thinking that the student is happy he could look on the device and it would tell him exactly what he feels and what percent of all the emotions take up. Overall, this Facial Action Coding System would be very beneficial in the classroom.

Another way this technology is benefical would be the calculations of the muscles of your face. What this means is the device would "" constructs a 3-D computer model of the face""(D'Alto). This model would show your face muscles and it would calculate how the are moved or know as ""action unit"". Then based on the movement of those muscles .The FACS device would list one of the"" six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadeness""(D'Alto). Finally, the last step to FACS device would be to get the results on that perticular person emotions.

In conclusion, this Facial Action Coding System would be valuable to classrooms. This device seems to be very reliable and can be used in many ways to just reading emotions all the way to using in drama class to react an emotion more realistic.         ",3

Air pollution can also cuase places that are very nice start looking a bit gloomy because of all of the bad cloud cover

Acid rain can cause massive destruction on a mass scale depending on the level of polluton in the rain. Right now its not as high but as more and more cars are being produced and driven more and more pollution is being emmited from the cars that are driven. if we as a community help  limmit the use of cars we can help the ammount of acid in the rain go down and therefor helping out the earth not just our community.

""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"" (Source 1). 70 percent of the the people is a lot, these streets are completly car-free except in the main thoroughfare and on the edge of the community, if this were to happen to a larger city the nights would be beatiful, and so will the days because you have all the car noise out and instead you have people talking and kids running all around the streets. ""Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Souce 1). Miami is a car-intensive area, I know this from personal experince, there is always traffic during the day. I've been to other places in Florida, not that far from Miami, in Palm Beach at night the amount of starts you see at nights is beautiful and it's something new to see other than in Miami you see 2 to 3 stars. My point here isn't stars, it's how much better the world can be if we all do what this small town in Germany is doing.

Paris, France. The city of lights home to millions of residents and a landmark for millions of tourists, one would think this city couldn't run without cars, but they made it happen. Paris wanted to clean all the air polution in their city, ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)"" (Source 2). Even though some didn't listen and about 4,000 drivers were fined, that is still very little compared to the entire population of Paris. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog"" (Source 2). Can you believe that? Traffic was down by 60 perfect in the city of lights, if it can happen there it can happen all around the world, little by little bu we'll get it. Public transportation was free of charge in the city while this car-free thing was going on. One week later the smog had cleared out enough for the ruiling French party to rescind the ban.

""BOGOTA, Colombia - In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Source 3). Yes, the city of Bogota in Colombia had its one car-free day, in Bogota called ""Day Without Cars"", this was the third year actually, on this ""car-free"" day cars are banned and only buses and taxis are permitted for the day. Bogota was not the only Colombian city to participate in this event, other Colombian cities like Cali and Valledupr, participated in this event for the first time. I find it funny and ironic because my sister has a friend who is Colombian and she owns a bicycle and she goes everywhere in that bicycle, and she refuses to get a car. Bogota is a very known city and just like I said before, if they can do it then the whole world can it. This day should be world wide and should be done at leats twice a year. Events like this will also get people motivated to start walking morre often. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restuarants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (Source 3). If you've ever been to Miami, you know the huge amount of building there are here and I think there are about 3 or 4 being built at I type, how about we stop there and make Miami and healthier and more environmentally friendly place.

In the United States, research shows ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" (Source 4). This meaning that adolescents aren't as intresting and driving as they were before, yeah I see how driving can be better but most kids here take the bus, they aren't even driven by their parents anymore. I find that this is a good thing because, one can ask themselves, I can't make a difference, but if thousands of people ask themselves that, then yes a difference can be made. In 2005 the miles driven by Americans peaked, and then steadily went dropping, in April, 2013 they found out that the miles in car was the same as it was in 1995. Not driving everywhere you go and actually walking there is a good thing because you can make new friends, and health wise it is also good because, instead of walking around your block for an hour, you can walk to someones house or to the store. There are several carpooling apps on the internet nowadays, if your friends can't pick you up, for just a push of a button you can have someone come pick you up to where ever you are and drop you off where you need to go to, for a low price. ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" (Source 4). This means that people aren't as interest in driving anymore, which means we are slowly getting near the time where we'll see more stars in the sky in car-intensive areas.               ",4
1240bc6,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you about the debate on the abolishment of the Electoral College. I see absolutely no point in the Electoral College because all it is is elected people from a state voting on the president based on what the popular vote for the president was in their assigned area.

The Electoral College has 538 electors. The majority of them are from the states of California, Texas, New York, and Florida. Election Day is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. I don't see why we need other people to vote for us. The Bill of Rights said that we have a ""freedom of speech"", but our ""freedom of speech"" is given to other people to change around. We need to abolish the Electoral Congress so we can just vote for who we want!

The popular vote means that the president who recieved more votes claims that the state voted more for him/her. The popular vote goes to our ""electors"" and they decide to vote for the President. We should just vote straight up because the election in 2008 was a huge mistake. Obama decides to do whatever he wants. Insurance prices have gone up due to ""ObamaCare"", and now there is a huge, long, and exhausting process to get te see a specialist especially if you need to see one. It is out of control and he needs to do something about it.

We should abolish the Electoral College because its just a waste. All they do is tally up the popular vote, and say ""OK, im going to vote for Romney since that's what my people want.""  Why can't we just vote for who we want instead of wasting our time! The popular vote should be the only way to vote. There shouldn't be a long and hard process to voting. If I go and vote, I don't want to have to know like 60 different people to vote for, I just want to check the box saying that I want to vote for 'so and so' and leave and go home. It is ridiculous about having a whole process to voting.

I hope this letter made up your mind on to vote

YES

for abolishing the Electoral College. When I get older and can start voting, I hope that I can vote for whom ever I want without being told that "" You just voted for nothing because the popular vote when to '(other Presidential Candidate)'and they won so they get the state.    ",2
5d34717,"So, what do you think the Face in the ground was created by? In my opinion, the Face was created by a natural landforms on mars. Resesachers of NASA have done serious reseach over the years just to tell how the Face was created. Pictures have been taking from differnt cameras over the years just to continue the long search on the Face. From, 1976 to 2001, the evidence in the picture has changed everytime.

The article states, "" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, "" he added. "" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" What the article is saying that there might have some kind of landform that created the Face. People are still curios til this very day on how the Face was formed or created. So, in my opinion the Face was created by a natural landform on Mars.

Some people think it's created by aliens. When there seems to be no type of life form on Mars. The

Face has changed over the processes in the picture. In my arguementive essay, I still haven't changed my theisis about how the Face was created. Through out the article, it tells you on how they processed the long journey to take the photo and make it clear on what it is. ",2
d5221c2,"There are a whole lot of positive and negative aspects about these cars. I truly agree with what's going on with the negative aspects of these cars. For example, things can happen with these cars that can drive by itself.

First, these cars could be a big safety issue. It can be a safety issue because the passage states that if there is any road work the driver should be ready to prepare to take over. Not only take over but also be ready when something happens with road work. Road work can be scary with the roads being bad and going around the road work can be difficult.This is where you think to yourself as, ""Why drive this car if you can be prepared and be alerted when you are responsible for your own car?""

Another safety issue is during traffic. Traffic is where a lot of accidents happen in the process of drivers. Yes, this car can break by its own but remember that anything can happen with this car. Expect the unexpected because if anything happens you may never know. The car could probably get a problem and miss understand something because it is computer authorized. It may not break when it is supposed to, or maybe not even get the alert that there is road work ahead.

Lastly, there is states that are still checking if it is reliably safe. This is still not proved at all if it's even safe. That especially is a big problem because you don't want to have a car that you don't even know if it is safe or not. If the car gets into a crash, that may be a responsibility that relies on you or the car. Think about it is the car going to get the ticket or is it you that's going to get it. We all don't know just remember safety first.

I disagree with having a car and I say this because I rather be safe then sorry. There is cars that I could get and have control over it than having a car that controlls by itself. If getting into an accident and I know how to explain that I had the control over it then it won't be a problem. That way I don't need to be worried or question about the car twice if in an accident knowing it controlls itself.    ",3
e5e24da,"In the real world of today, many people crave for the technologies of the future and one of those technologies are driverless cars. Humans have always looked to the future where cars would one day be able save us in more accidents. We also want cars to use less fuel and could be able to drive us anywhere. However, we never truly look on at what it takes to build a driverless car, until we do. However, not only do driverless cars take time to make, once driverless cars are complete, there is more responsiblity that comes with the product. Driverless cars a great thing for our future because the cars can save us in moments where humans can fail, each of them will use less fuel, and drive us anywhere.

Even today, there are driverless cars andregular cars present the ability so prevent accidents to some extent. In each of today's cars, there are sensors and other gadgets that send information to the car's computer. Processing this information, cars can apply brakes to certain tires and cut the engine in faster time than humans could, if the time ever came up for it. One such car, Google's modified Toyota Prius runs such sensors, video cameras, and gps recievers to run driverless car software.

Another reason, driverless cars will help the gas prices lower all around the world. Gas prices constantly rise as more demand for it arises and the supply of it lowers. The driverless cars of the future will need as less as half the amount of fuel or lower. With cars needing less fuel, the prices will lower due to it being affordable to give to everyone. And with more fuel, cars can travel farther and to more places.

With this in mind, the driverless cars of the future will drive humans to any place needed. Some may think it impossible, but Google cofounder Sergey Brin belives otherwise. He believes the cars in the future could be used as a public transportation system, with fleets of driverless cars as public-transport taxis. He believes it can be great.

However, for a driveless car to be the greatest it can be, it first has to be driverless. The driverless cars that are currently existing today cannot claim the title of driverless. Each car will drive to the destination as required but will alert the human to stay awake and alert such that one can take over the car when nearing accidents or work zones. So that raises the question, how can we make this car truly driverless?

The technology and cars of today are not driverless yet but in time they could be. These future cars will drive humans to any destination without human assistance. Each car will run on less fuel, effectively lowering gas prices. And with its software, the car and the human will witness less accidents. Due to special software, the cars will prevent accidents,burn less fuel, and drive to any destination.",4
52f1aea,"Do you think a computer would be able to tell your emotional expressions on your face? I think that would be crazy if a computer really could see how your feeling on the emotions on your face. There is six different emotions the computer will know happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddness. It works just like how you talk to someone every day there going to know your facial expressions.

While your on your computer if your on there for something for school or just scrolling to see whats on there your computer will know if you don't like what your on or not so it will change it to something you do like. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", Dr. Huang. This could be good for students who struggle with a topic there learning about in school and could help them make it a little bit easier. It will help student actually wanting to do the assignment instead of giving up on it right away.

Say if your little brother wanted to play a video call of duty for example they would animae it to be more of a kid virison or take them to another or easier cite. If you see an ad you like it will take you to a similar ad but if you dont like that ad it will try to take you to something you might like. It's just all how your facial expressions are.

Your probably wondering how the computer is going to work in the first place well the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face. It will have 44 major muscles and the model must have move like human muscles. That is how the computer is going to know if your happy or sad ect. The computer will also have video imagery so the software tracks know your facial movements.

I think this computer will be a great thing in the future to help kids and even adults with work, and school ect. To see what a computer could do just by see your facial expressions is pretty cool. I feel like this computer will help a lot of students with there school work and improve there work.",3

Dear state senator,

I want to take the time to speak my mind and said whats wrong with the clectoral college.  The electoral college is a process, not a place that what i've read. The founding fathers established it in the constitution between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizen. The electoral college consists of 538 elctors. a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.

Under the electoral collage system, votets vote not for the prisident, but for slate of elector who there elect the presient. the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. the amercan people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest electoin crisis in a century. consider that state legislatures are technically resonsible for picking electors and those electors could always defy the will of the people. each state casts only one vote, the single  representative from wyoming, representing 500,000 voters,would have as much say 55 representatives from california, who represent 35 millon votes. that  many voters vote one party for president and another for congress.

the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president  taht ought to be overruled by declaring  the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.    ",1
98bbdf1,"The electoral college is an institution that has always guided  the presidential elections. The electoral college is tradition and shouldn't be changed because it has balanced relegation of power within the states, there is almost always a definate winner, and it is able to hold a set timeline for the elections. The college has always been able to choose a president that is able to lead our country well, the electoral college is a representation of the people of the United States of America. As the president's constituents, we have the power to choose our leader, and they make it a little easier for us.

The electoral college takes into account the populations of each state within its calculations. This is why Wyoming has only three votes and Florida has twenty nine. It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people each state has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning each state has at least three votes, decided by its population. This is not a very bad system because the states with huge populations have a bit of their power curbed by the number of electors. So if Wyoming increases its population, and Florida has its population decreased, one of the electors could be removed from Florida and added to Wyoming, balancing the scale of power between them. It's only fair for a populous state like Florida to have more electors anyway, there are many opinions that are yearning to be heard within the ginormous population, and there must be enough electors who can take it upon themselves to voice them. The Electoral College protects us from the probability of voting just because the candidate is from the same state. A majority of people will vote because of a close association with a candidate if the electoral college is abolished. This is why the electoral college only contains 538 people, because nobody wants millions of voters in California voting for the same candidate just because they are the Governor of California.

Due to the even amount of votes in the electoral college, there is a slight chance of a tie. However, with all but two states being part of the ""winner-take-all"" system, the chance of that happening are astronomically low. This is why swing states are so important to the canditates, they know that the chances of them winning the votes in the other party's states are almost impossible, so they must gather all of the votes they can from the states that are known for their swing-like tendencies. It also goes the other way, each candidate trusts that their own party's states will vote for them, so there is no need to waste the money and campaign. Unless its the primary elections, candidates don't typically campaign where they know that the votes are all but set in stone. It's like going grocery shopping, if you know that you are allergic to peanut butter and you already have all the jam you need, you will only go for the special bread that everybody fights for right? The candidates are the same, they don't go after what they already have and what they can't have, only what they might earn, or else it's just a waste of money, so nobody should be able to complain about a candidates campaigning.

A president has always been inaugrated on either January 20th or March 4th, to change that would be blasphemous to both the people and to the United States of America. So it is imperitive that the decision is made early, so that tradition and will not be broken. Contrary to popular belief, there is a set timeline that the election process goes through, and without the electoral college, it is highly possible and probable that the timeline will be broken. The election process is guided by this timeline, for example, voting starts on the second Thursday of the month of November every single time. The Electoral College is a huge part of this process also, and to destroy that would be heartbreaking for the nuerotics that can't stand any change in routine. If the Electoral College were to be abolished, and popular vote was to be instigated throughout the country, any semblance of a schedule would be torn away. Problems would spring up all over the place, and everything would all go to hell. Instead of recounts for counties, whole states would need recounts. If a populous state like Texas were to need a recount, never mind a week, a month wouldn't be enough time to recount it all perfectly. The government would be stuck without a leader, and worst case scenario, the United States of America could be put in a state of anarchy by the end of the decade. Then, we wouldn't be United anymore.

The Electoral College has been there from the beginning, and the without it the United States of America could be thrown into chaos. Traditions shouldn't be broken and the Electoral College represents the biggest one of them all, it balances power between each of the states, defines a true winner, and guides the U.S. on a set timeline. It wouldn't be a far stretch to say that the Electoral College helps keep the order of the country. Truthfully, everyone needs some semblance of order, and the Electoral College provides that and more.    ",5
96aa32c,"Limiting car usage is not bad at all! It benifts everyone in a specific way.

As stated in the article 'Car-Free Cities' Source 1: Heidrum Walter, a media trainer and mother two quotes ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much more happier this way"" Heidrum being a mother two you can only imagine the car trips she would have to make. Going place to place can cause a lot of stress to some people and it makes it harder for them to drive. For example, someone could be stressed to the max with all the traffic and driving around that it could create accidents along the way. No one should ever feel stressed while driving. Driving should be a privellege and good one.

In Paris they have banned driving due to smog. Diesel fuel was balmed since France has tax ploicy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. Paris has more smog than other European capitals. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. Certain things like this can help save the environment without the usage of vehicles.

With no car usage it prevents teens from getting into accidents and or drunk driving. The safer way to go is to walk or stay with a friend somewhere safe than being on the road. Many accidents could be prevented but it wont if limiting the car usage is not available. Death rates will decrease and many people will be safer this way. A study last year found that drving by young people decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Without transportation many young people could make other main priorities. For example, they could organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

Up above I have given my reasons why we should all limit car usage. It would relieve stress from on the road, saves the environment and takes the smog away, and young people would be more socialize and up for doing more than what they already do like jobs.            ",4
ce37922,"I would claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions. i would like to help students with their problems like anger depresson and what ever they have. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) would help with students' emotions. This software could indentify any emotion you have and the face exprestions you have and it would calculate ever days feeling.

First, it would indentify any emotion you have. Just like Mona Lisa they found out that she was eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and two percent angry. ""The facial expressiions for each emotion are universal,""abserves Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression""(like not smiling as broadly). Dr. Huang used video imagery, and tracked the new emotion-recognition software and the facial movements. In the real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece) by weighting the different units in every expression is against a neutral face (showing no emotion)""

Finally, calculating your emotions. Are you asking yourself if the software can calculate emotiond like math homework? This process begins with the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. The forty-four muscles in the modle mus move like human muscles. Dr. pual Ecjman has classified some basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with chracteristic movements of the facial muscles. An example they give is, ""Your frontalis muscles (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when youre surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" Its pretty intrusting how it can determined your emotions.

My conclusion is that the technology to the software would be a great thing to use because it would helpin so many emotions and it would help students in so many ways. I think its intrusting in how Dr. Eckman invented the FACS and can determined in how students feel. ",2

I am writting this letter to you in regards of trying to persuade you to help change the election of the president of the United States. For many years, we the people , have fought our way towards freedom, and your assistence has been with us for a very long time, but if we the people have managed to fight for our freedom, than I beleive that we also have the power to choose our president. We can't just have a president based on congres's opinion, we all have different opinions. That is why we all stand as one and decide who we vote for. Instead of having 270 people vote for our president, why dont we have thousand's of people vote for our president.

We decide what is good and bad for us, not congress . Many people ,ie Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, the US Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO have all agreed on to abolish the electoral college. As the passage say, in 1960 segregationist nearly succeded in replacing democratic  electors with new ones. that means the they might have despise Kennedy, one of our most succesful presidents. After all, the electoral college is unfair to voters, besides the electoral college is pretty old. We are living in the future, where we learned from our ancestors mistakes not just about life but also about politics.  Most people consider the electoral colege as outdated or as an anchronism. By YOU helping US, we could abolish the electoral college.

it also doesnt mean let it get outta hand then try to real it in as soon as possible the only way this would work is if we had some one who didnt care who won eaither way so long as eveything is fair and not messed with. so what im trying to get at is that we dont always get our way but that doesnt mean we need to shut down the Electoral Collage.

a7d8379,"Empty streets,with eerily devoid traffic jams is an example of what happens when a city bans car usage. Cleaner air, and less stress are two of the many reasons why the idea of limiting car usage is becoming popular. Many cities are taking place in what they call a "" Car-Free Day"" in which they participate in a day without cars. Taxis and buses are permitted only, with the goal to promote alternitive transportation. Bikers covered the streets and hikers flooded the sidewalks as a result of car-free day. Violators were faced with fines of $ 25.

A day without cars is considered part of an improvement to many cities. Cars cause major damage to the world around us, smog is one of the many reasons places like Paris are reducing their car usage as well. Car usage reduction has beneficial implications for the enviorment we live in. Paris is a testimony to that statement. With smog polluting the global city, Paris was forced to create a partial driving ban to clear the air. WIth France favoring diesel fuel over gasoline, Paris had more smog than other European capitals. Therefore, Paris decided to make motorists with even-numbered license plates leave their cars at home. Same with the odd-numbered license plates the following day. Reuters claim that up to 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 car owners had their vehicle impounded due to their reactions to the fines. After the ban was implemented, the smog had cleared enough for the French ruling party to remove the ban off of odd-numbered plates the next day.

Car reduced communities are finding that being less dependant on cars is helping by drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Less pollution is a major goal being achieved by this concept of reduced car usage. "" It's a good oppertunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Carlos Arturo Plaza commented as he rode his two-seat bicycle with his wife.

Fellow citizens it is our responsibility to stop pollution, take a stand by reducing your car usage. Ride your bike to school or work instead of driving. Walk to places near by and give your car a break. Consume less gas, stop choking your city. Make an impact today, put your car away. Global pollution is adding to the problems of our global warming today.    ",3
287f1a7,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author talks about the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. This would enable computers to identify human emotions. Say you were looking at ads and you didn't like one ad so you frowned, the computer would be able to detect that and it would show you something different, but if you smiled then it could show you something similar to that ad. This new technology would be very helpful and valuable in classrooms.

Being able to use this technology in classrooms could be such a help for some students. Since now majority of schools use laptops in the classrooms or they go to computer labs to work this could be a help. There are a lot of students that are afraid to ask their teacher for help when they don't understand a probelm that they are working on because they feel embarrassed for not understanding something that most of the class in understanding. Having this technology in class that could read your facial expressions while you are working could be a huge help. The technology could be able to tell if a student is confused, nervous, or any other emotion while he or she is working on the lesson. The computer would be able to continue going at the pace it is going while going over the lesson, or be able to slow down its pace if the student shows expressions of not understanding what is going on. The technology could even recognize when the student is becoming bored of the lesson and it could be able to make the lesson more exciitng. The technology would be able to modify the lesson with any type of facial expression.

Some people might argue that they don't want their face to be read by a computer because they think that the governement could be watching their children, but once they see that their childrens grades have possibly improved because of this new technology they will change their mind. This is why this technology would be valuable in classrooms.                ",3
ebae254,"Imagine having the oppertunity to view the unique landscpaes of Venus. The Earth-like planet has been a mystery to mankind because of it's inhabiatble enviornemnt. This article goes into great detail on why humans should study Venus despite it's dangers. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit by including the similarities it shares with Earth, stating that Venus was once like our planet, and discovering the mysteries of our twin planet would be a success.

The author states that Venus shares little similarities with Earth. The article includes, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This gives an expample of how Venus is somewhat related to Earth. The author also states that Venus was once like Earth. Paragraph four states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Lastly, the author states that there is much to be gained from exploring Venus. Paragraph eight includes, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This highlights how it would be a success to study Venus.

The author gives valid reasons that studying Venus would be a genius idea by stating how much similarities Venus and Earth share, and how an accomplishment it would be to discover the curiosities of our sister planet. The author strongly agrees that studying Venus will lead us to unanswered questions with the technology and knowledge humans have. ",3

NASA is looking at electronics that they are making so that they can last up there just becase it can be up to 170 degrees in venus and they need to make everything to be resistant to the warmness and heat . Also the prssure that it will give beacsue all those things can just melt and that we should keep learning . not being scared of whats ahead to see what else is out there and to see what other kind of information we can get from going to Venus and exploring more and more and also that the scientist need to get really close to see what

04128c7,"Driving cars that could drive you anywhere as in a taxi or your own car are finally coming to our furture and comig fast. There are many people out there who disagree on the idea Google has came out with. There are many different reson why you should and should buy this car they can be seen in positives and negatives. My reason when it comes to buying a driveless car is that you should or try to get a driveless car, but on the other had there are some bad reason why you shouldnt.

First few positive reasons I think you should buy this car is because its a proven fact that it can lower the risk of texting a driving. Since the 2000s the rate of texting and rving drivng has went up a massive of numbers. And plus they made a few models of the google car back in 2000 for a special track and it proved that its safe and could lower the stakes of a accident. They took one to the street and drove it 1 million miles and havent even crashed yet. But when it comes to parking and coming in a drive way its up to the driver to do that.

Then when it comes down to the gas its very conservant. For an example when the driver is sleepy or had a long day at work they can take a little nap whe its in driveless mode. If there are any roadblocks or construction problems the car will alert the driver that it is time to take action and drive. And if there is any misconveince the car will knock down the speed to about 25 mph. This furture car can turn, accelerate and even brake. Is this what we been waiting for all of our lifes?

Finaly when it comes down to buying this car do it!! Who would ever imagine a car driving itself when ever the driver needs it to. Like a friendly robot that is always there for you when you need them. In this few positives and barely any negatives my addvice is add the new car to your collection or garage. ",3
cf1f159,"Cars that drive themselves. Seems a little like a science fiction movie doesn't it? As soon as I heard this theory, it reminded me of the Jetsons. Self-driving cars just seem a little too farfetched to be believable. Not only are they fantasy-like, they seem expensive and unnecessary. Cars that drive themselves are not something that we should introduce into our daily lives.

Picture this- New York City, a busy afternoon. If you've ever seen a movie set here, you can just image the thousands of taxis swarming around like busy bees making honey. The only thing is, this honey is money. If self-driving cars were introduced into society as a serious addition, there would be millions of Americans who would eventually lose thier jobs. As the author states in paragraph one, ""Google cofounder Sergey Brin... envisions a future with a public transport system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system."" This means taxi drivers, bus drivers, and eventually car dealers and manufacturers will slowly lose their jobs.

Besides the point of job loss, think about the safety of these vehicles. What if a driver is just driving along one day, and suddenly the technology fails. What if there's the tiniest glitch, or maybe even a hacker? What if the driver loses total control of their car? This is a very negative and scary possibility that can risk many people's lives. Technology can't see in real time through human eyes and react to situations like we instinctually can. There are just some things that should be left to people, and I think driving is one of them.

In conclusion, I honestly think self-driving cars will just cause more problems than they'll actually fix. The cost of manufacturing and retailing these cars is potentially very high. Not only that, but you may be risking someone's life. Cars that drive themselves should just stay a dream. ",3

You get to see cool places all around the world, your helping the world, and you will meet lots of new people from different areas of the world. This is a great chance for all people, even teenagers. You will ride a boat with a captain all over the world.

You get to see cool places all around the world like China and Europe. You can explore them too. There are also cool activities you can do in these countries. For example, you could eat there type of food,or go sight seeing, trust me its beautiful. There are lots of things to do when you've arrived at a different country. This is a life changing experience that you might not get a chance to do. This might be your only chance to be a Sea Cowboy.

Your helping the world a bunch by giving other countries horses that they might not have because of a war or natural causes and so on. This helps you become a better person and it helps other countries and the people your giving the horses to. This helps everyone in that country because they might not have a car and there horse died ,and that was there only transpertation and they don't have any horses left that they can buy. If we give them horses, now that family has transpertation again. So this will help others and yourself.

You would meet lots of new people in these countries and you meet your crew. You meet Chinese and Eurpeon people and more. You would learn new languages from all over the world. You could learn lots of things from the people in other countries. For example you could learn there culture and what type of food they eat or even there style of houses. This will stay with you forever in memory. It will be one of the most fun experience you'll ever think about. These people can tell you about there life and what they have been through.

This was surely fun for me but I sadly will have to move on next year. I now that if you do this, you'll be sad when you have to move on too. But you'll remember all the cool places, how you help different countries in the world, and how you meet all those nice people and talked about there background. Trust me this was a experience of a life time. That I and you, would never forget.                     ",3
143409c,"Many places in Europe, Paris, Colombia, and The United States have all had a ""car-free day"" or less driving each year. These changes have showed such a drastic change in lower air pollution and smog in the atmospher. As well as less pollution there has been a drastic change in amount of crowed areas, and less driving. These are all advantages, as well as the less amount spent on car and license plates in each of these cities. Limiting car usage has such a drastic change on the enviorment as well as the citzens pockets.

""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe..""  (Source 1) Paris enforced a partial driving ban to have cleaner air after almost reaching a new record for polluted air. Paris has much more smog and polluted areas than Europeans capitals which are known as the most conjested areas. In Bogota, Colombia many people rode on buses and bikes and even walked to there destination on car-free days to reduce smog. Those who did not follow the rule where fined up to 25$.  A businessman Carlos, rode a two- seat bike for him and his wife and stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower aur pollution."" After this huge event other Colombian cities joined this event for advantages of low pollution. In the United State, ""Has America passed peak driving?"" (Source 4) In 2005 there was a show in less driving and since it has decreased. If this decreasing of driving continues to change there will be such a huge advantage on the air pollution from cars. As well as less air pollution, the change in driving cars and ""car-free days"" has lead to less overloading areas and conjestion.                                                          ",3
41b9987,"Facial Action Coding System is a new software that has given computers the ability to identify the emotion of a person. It does this by constructing a 3-D model of the face. This new innovative software can identify six emotions of a human. These emotions are happiness, disgust, anger, sadness, and fear. This tecnology can be useful in many different ways in today's world. There are also some things that may not be so good about this either.

This software has many positve things about it that can help students and teachers across the world. The software can help inside the classrooms. Using this software to calculate and identify people's emotions, it would be very easy to see if a student is struggling. Many students who struggle keep it to themselves hoping to catch on. This may not be the case in every student, though. Dr. Huang predicts that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" If this software can actually detect this, then it would make learning and teaching way easier. Teachers could try different teaching methods to help with the growth and progress of their students and help them understand what they're doing. They could aslo try something that is more fun and appesaling to the students. This technology could be lifesaving in the classroom.

Although this software could help many people everywhere, how does everyone feel about this? If used in the classrooms, some parents and students may not want this to be a part of their learning environment. Many students could be sad all of the time due to person issues and home life. Would they want their teacher to know that they were always upset? I think that it would be a good idea to first have recieved permission from every student and parent before allowing this into the classrooms.

I also think that this software could literally save lives. If it is able to identify these emotions, it could prevent students from harming themselves. The software can determine your emotion based on every little detail of your face. In pararaph 8 the author states, ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" With this being said, if you try to hide your emotions, the computer will still be able to tell. I think school counslors should have this tecnology in schools right now. Getting proper equipment to identify how a student is feeling could help the counselors talk to them about their problems because not all students will share how they feel.

With all the information that i provided, I definitely think that this technology is valuable. The software provides accurate results and it could eaily help students and teachers everyday in the classroom. What more could you ask for than a safe and reliable software that could raise test scores and possibly save some lives? This may just be the next big thing.                ",5
d02c595,"This article about driverless cars implies that this technology is bad and good. I personally do not like the aspet of driverless cars. Although they are unique and exclusive I do not want to take part in any of it. With these cars the driver will still have to be on alert. Why have a driverless car that the driver will be notified to be ready?

There is no need for driverless cars in our society. Having a driverless car would mean that we neccesarily do not need driver liencense because we are not driving, it is! Would that not also mean that children under that age of 16 could possibly own a driverless car? The law will have to be reconfigured inside and out if our society allows these cars.

The article states that new laws will be needed in order to cover liablity in the case of an accident. Which raises the question of whose fault is it if there was an accident. Another reason for not allowing driverless cars is will it have to charge since it is using electricity? Drivers might also fall asleep waiting for their turn to drive. If the technology fails that will result in serious injury.

Therefore the producers of driverless cars should disband the project. A lot of changes will come if they continue, and some people do not like change. Drunk drivers will be allowed to be in a driverless car since the are not really driving. If the companies making driverless cars can answer these question and fix the issues then why not allow them, but until then driverless cars should not be allowed.   ",3
3e68222,"Did you know that the planet Venus is well known as a misleading planet and a very dangerous place in outer space. Here are three facts from the article that the author discuss. History of venus, misleading planet, beyond danger.

Venus is a very unique planet to study and the history why the planet is a very challeging place. Venus is very simple to see from the distant but safe vantage. It is also well known as Earth's ""twin."" Planet Venus is sometime called the ""Evening star,"" it to be known one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. However Venus is actually a planet in our solar system in outer space it has proved that it is a very challenging place to examine more closely.

Venus is well known for its nickname ""misleading."" Each of the previous mission was unmanned, and for a very good purpose. In paragraph 2 it stated this ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" Due to the reason that Venus is sometime around the corner in terms of space human have sent numerous of spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world.

The planet Venus is a very dangerous place to live in or even to take a trip. Venus temperature is beyond high pressure and heat although planet mars is to be known the closest planet to the sun but, a thick atmosphere of almost ninty seven carbon dioxide blankets Venus. It's even more challeging when the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet venus of the surface the average temperature is over eight hundred degree Fahrenheit. The greatest pressure of atmospheric is ninty times greater that what most people have experience on our planet.

In conclusion this essay has proven that planet Venus is a very beautiful planet to look at but, it is a beyond what a normal human can handle such as a high temperature, and a deadly it the deadliest place out of all of the solar system palnet.",3
99d56b3,"The author made a great point about how we should still or should study Venus. Even though it might be dangerous there is a goood reason why we should still study it. For example lets say you want to do a carreer that is about being a mechanic but you want to make your own car. what would you do to accomplish that? well of course you would study and even though it might be dangerous cause you might get shoked or might crash for a few times. Anyways back about Venus, Venus is a very very hot planet. We are still studying other planets like how they were made. Even though we still can't get stuff on Venus we can still study what things we could send to venus and again the stuff may not be able to survive or last long but it's a attempt we should try. In paragraph 5 says that NASA possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Vnus would allow scientist to float above the fray. Even though there is a problem there will always be a solution to a problem , just by studying can that be possible.",2
ed17331,"Viking 1 photo was taken in 1976 and had people believing all sorts of things. It apperred to be a human face, but was not yet proven to be one. Some belived that is was just a natural landform, but which one is it? This mask on Mars was soon unmasked on May 24, 2001, and is proven to be a natural landform. They have used better pictures and comparison from Earth.

Using pictures to discorver the ""Face on Mars"" was difficult in 1976 because we did not have high tech cameras to prove anything, but as the years gone by we could soon tell the truth. For example, 22 years later Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) was able to take a picture of the figure ten times sharper. After this picture was taken, more people were able to believe that this mask on Mars was just natural landform. Then 3 years later in 2001 we had taken another picture that was even closer and it diffinetly showed landform.

Yes, the ""Face on Mars"" was discorvered to be a mesa, or landforms common around the American West. With all these pictures from 1976 to 2001, we had compared them to these Earth landforms. For example, Garvin says that it reminds him of most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

This mysterious figure on Mars had turned out to be just natural landform called a mesa. The evidence and details have proven that through pictures and comparison. There is no longer a need to believe any alien monument or life on Mars. Sure, the viking 1 photo gave an illusion, but the MGS image from 2001 gives more evidence to what it really is. Thanks to Malin's teams, that caputured an extraodinary photo to prove the truth.",3
0a8590a,"sould we keep the elecoral collage or should we change it to election by how many popual votes for being the president of the unioted states.

what is the callage electoral ?

the electoral collage is a compromise between electing a president by voteing in congress and election of the president by how many popalar vote for qualified as to be a president.

teh electoral has many process such as meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

oto be elected for president u need to have a majority of 270 electorals votes cause the electoral callage consists of 538 electors under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the district of columbai is allocated 3 electors and trated like a statte for purposes of the electoral collage.

pretty much each candidate running for president in any state has his or her own group of electors.

any president thats running for election is held every fore years on the tuseday after the first monday in novermber.

most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winninfg presidential candidate.

elctoral collage they're not alone according to a gullup poll in 2000, taken shortly after al gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collage won the popular.

the problem with electrola collage is that under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president.

thje singel best argument against the electoral collage is whtat we might call the disaster factor. we consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electtors.

perhaps most worrying thing is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. and the election would br thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

at the most basic level, the electoral collage is unfair to voters. because of the winner-take-all system in eavh state, bcandiadates dont spend time in state they know they have no chance of winninf-g, focusinfg only on the races in the swing states.

collage method of selcting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.

voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a sinle vote may decide a n election.

in my conculesion we should change the election by who has most popular votes for the president of the untied states, because it make more scence the election always go by votes and who ever have the most votes is elected for the president of the untied state. the eletoral collage system wasnt that good to many things going on i mean like it was kinad of good but not better then election on popaler votes.

c3dc201,"Voting has always been something special for almost everyone. From African Americans fighting in the Civil War for the right to vote and women in the nineteenth-century also fighting for voting rights, Voting had always been a controversial topic. This privilege has changed many times in the beginning of the United States and since its birth, the primary way to vote for the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral college is a process of electors in it voting for the president. It is almost always an one-sided battle for whoever that agrees or disagrees with the Electoral Colloge. For someone that is usually neutral, i am in favor of keeping the Electoral College as the United States choose their president.

To begin with, even though the Electoral College is critisized of it not being democratic, it still allows the peoples' voices to be heard and expessed. The trust between the people and their electors is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College will  almost always gurantee an outcome while if it was another way, more ties and balancing will happen. from the article itself, it stated ""Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.""- Richard A. Posner. The Electoral College will always let the people's voices be heard even if it was in a indirect way.

Furthermore, The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No single region in the United States ave enough electoral votes for a president to get elected. Regional favorites, such as Romney in the south, will have plenty of problems if he is just a regional favorite instead of all over the country. This system will caused presidents to be more diversed in the country to be able to spread hierachical diffusion of the idea of geting themselves to be elected. From source number three, it also states that ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.""- Richard A. Posner. The people will get to experience the president themselves instead of jst voting for the one they are biased upon.

Lastly, The Electoral College method of selecting the president avoids the problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast and also dissovles the problem of few potential voters not wanting to vote. There is a pressure in which if no candidates win a majority of the vote,there will be a run-off election. that would greatly complicate the presidential election process by wasting more time and money. however, that process is reduced by the Electoral College method, which invariably produces a clear winner. The Electoral College System can also be argued against that it can turn off potential voters for a candidate who had no hope of carrying thier state. ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, there will be less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.""- Richard A. Posner is one of the quotes in source number three. But of course, no single vote can change the outcome of a presidential election since voters in presidential elections are mpstly people who want to express an opinion than thinking that a single vote will change a election.

In conclusion, our current way of the Electoral College system is the best way to vote for presidential elections. Even though people could argue that it is un-democratic, the way they elect the electors and having the president promote themselves in a certain way does make the system every one bit of it democratic. To remind you senator, the Electoral Collage system should stay because it still allows the peoples' voices to be heard and expessed, requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, and it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast and also dissovles the problem of few potential voters not wanting to vote. That is why i truly believe that the Electoral Collage is here to stay.    ",5
535fa0d,"The future is full of all sorts of amazing innovations and technologies.

Life would not be the same without technology, and it seems like no one could live a day without it.

Each year the driving age requirement lowers and more accidents are occurring.

Although driverless cars are very intreeging, there are too many disadvantages that require everyone to rethink if this is what they truly want.

The main unappealing aspect of technology and engineering is that driverless cars do not have eyes, ears, or a sense of touch.

They solely rely on their sensors and other detecting qualities.

There is no way to hear if danger is coming, so how could a car react?

They may be able to detect someone or something as it approaches, but would it be too late to stop?

There are just some things that are safer if put in the hands of a living, sensing organism rather than a cold piece of hardware.

Although it may not be the very first question in mind, everyone has to wonder about the cost-benefit ratio.

If these cars really can drive themselves, how many people would be able to afford them.

Are these cars any good if only a few people are using them?

In addition, at the moment, ""self driving"" cars are only functioning at 25 mph.

This is not even a major road speed.

No one would spend a fortune on a car that can mostly drive itself at a staggering 25 mph.

This just is not reasonable.

There are some people who can afford these advanced machines, but there is not a high enough demand to continue developing the cars.

The very last thing any one would like to think about is a malfunction.

Technology nowadays is very advanced, but as anyone around technology would know, they do not always work.

Electronics such as the sensors always have the capability to not act as they are expected.

Distracted driving is a problem that leads to crashes, but if there were semi-self driving cars, drivers would still be distracted.

If they needed to take over and react, who is to say they will be safer?

The whole point of the driverless car is so no one needs to stay alert.

In addition to malfunctioning, the car could steal control.

If there is a situation where the driver needed to control, what if the technology thinks it is smarter and tries to override it?

There are just too many problems with putting a 2,000 pound piece of machinery, capable of killing a man in an instant, in the hands of some sensors all so the driver can relax.

There may seem to be many great qualities to having a self driving car, but there are no gauruntees in what that entails.

Cars can not sense the world in the same way as humans, and they are simply not living and reacting.

There is a major cost commitment on something potentially dangerous, and no way to help if the car takes over your driving abilities.

When in doubt, the driver knows what to do, but will he be able to do it?

There should be research in how to make our driving safer for everyone and not just an easy task to take lightly. ",4
77ced86,"In this passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author made very detailed and valid points about the use of technology detecting what our expressions say about our moods, but, technology reading students facial expressions is over the top. I belive that this new technology would force students to always want to force a smile so that the computer doesn't fully recognize their real from their fake. In this essay I am going to tell you about my opinions on why I think that this new technology is bad for anyone to even have.

First, I would like to say that this is a really good topic the author brings forth to the table, but who would want to feel like their being watched? ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This information is truly invalid. Smiling at an ad does not make it appear the next time you get on a different website, and frowning at an ad doesn't change it either. It's the way the ads are set up that it makes them leave or come back. Student's shouldn't have to feel like they have to fake their emotions just so that the computer doesn't recognize how they feel in reality. I do not believe in this ""new technology"" that seems to be changing the way we see ourselves. I would not want kids to feel like they are being watched or even judged on by what they look like through a computer screen.

Lastly, I would like to say that this point of view that the author is taking is a very good start, but thinking about the author feels versus the way every one else would feel puts this topic on hold. Not every one wants their child to be watched through a computer screen that's looking at their faces to show how they feel. If some one is happy on the inside but frowing on the outside then how would the computer sense that? Sometimes we hide our emotions on the indside and show neutral expressions to everyone else outside of our hearts and mind. Computers can only detect what they see and not what is actually going on. That is why I believe that the value of using technology to read students' emotional expressions should be forgotten.",3
1618e72,"The media is everywhere. Everyday, you hear gossip about celebrities in magazines, movies, and social media. Millions of movies and magazines are released all of the time around the world. More than half of the time, the facts they tell us aren't even close to accurate. You can't always trust the Media, especially when including scientific facts. Twenty five years ago something peculiar happened on Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars, taking pictures, and spotted a Martian Mesa. The Media is lying to all of us. Are they honestly trying to get us to believe that the Mesa is something that was created by aliens? That's purposturous. If ""aliens"" did however create the Mesa, NASA would benifit from it.

You can't trust information from movies or magazines because most of the time, they are false accuzations. Most of the ""facts"" they tell us about are completely untrue. There isn't enough scientificly proven facts to believe what magazine and movie writers are telling us. The Mesa is just a huge rock formation, not an alien created object. NASA is a very sophisticated scientific group, trust the information they tell us, not false information.

I understand that few scientists believe that aliens somehow created the Mesa. But, an extremely large amount of scientists highly disagree. There is absolutley no scientific proof of aliens created the Mesa on Mars. NASA has stated that it's just a rock formation. if aliens created it, NASA would release that information.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin took his Mars Orbiter Camera to fly to Cydonia where he would take a picture of the rock formation. He later revealed on a JPL website, that it was just a nautral landform. NASA's information is always correct. Thanks to Michael Malin, we have proof that the Mesa is just a rock formation.

In conclusion, NASA has provided all of us with many accurate facts about the Martian Mesa. Some people still choose to argue, even though NASA has already provided us with all of the right answers. I hope I have pursuaded you to think more into the facts that are scientifically correct, unlike the Media's version of the story.            ",4

If everyone has the opportunity to drive one of these cars, then crashes will be reduces significantly.

Not only does the new technology in the cars have the abilty to stop crashes, they allow the car tranmit information to the people inside the car incase there is a malfunction. In 2013, BMW announced the start of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". Although the progrma does not make cars completely driverless, it shows that we are coming closer to creating cars with the ability to make driving safer. BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" has special touch sensors that makes sure the driver has his or her hand on the steering wheel at all times. Teh new technolgy can sterr, brake and accelerate themselves, but its primary design is to notify the driver when the raid ahead needs the skills of a human driver. Some of these warning include flashing lights or windshield display that can notify the driver if the situation needs human skills.

Although, a completley driverless car is still in the furture, new technolgies have shown that a driverless car is safe enough to invest in. With its features keeping people focused, crashes caused by texting, sleeping, or even drunk driving will decrease. Also the amount of people speeding will drop resulting in less tickets and overall safer rods that everyoen can drive on without the fear of getting in a car crash.   ",3

Thats because air pollution has greatly increased in  recent years and the number one reason for air pollution is the exhaust from your cars. Yes, the amount of cars in the world has increaesed dramtically in the last 10 years. While this is good that the luxury of owning an auto mobile it has also put a burden on the earth and future generations. while cars have made it easier for our day to day lives the amount of pollution in the world has become too high to not do something about it now. instead of taking the modern convenience of a car what if you decided to ride your bike to work for a change.

The fact that the amount of pollution is ever imncreasing should be enough of a reason to limit car usage. Instead of driving every time you go somewhere if you just rode a bike or walked when its convienient you could make a difference in the world. You dont have to completely stop driving your car but just limit the amount of times you do drive and that little extra effort will make a big difference in the long run. the world is facing an epidimic in which we could not have clean air for our future generations to be able to take their kids to the park and enjoy a nice day in the sun.

Not only is limiting your car usage better for the enviroment it is also better for your body. When  you decide to ride your bike or walk opposed to driving your car you are getting a work out from doing so. This may not seem like much but when you look at how often you go places the numbers start to add up. In the ten minutes that you would take to go to the bank you could spend fifteen minutes riding your bike and getting exercise multiple times through out the day. thiss can also give you much more free time to do something physically active that you ignored because of a car, with the motivation to go out pollution free you can start up running or even learn how to skate and enjoy the go.

When you decide to make the change and not drive as much you open up endless possibilities for what you could do instead of sitting in one place driving. You become more active in the community and this helps the enviroment and you as a person. limited driving has been proved to be a great idea in more ways than you would think. Just doing your part can help out.

In conclusion the facts are all here that limited car usage is the best way to go for decreasing air pollution and making you a better you. It will help the future become a brighter and cleaner place to live.            ",4
b0fc064,"A good reason for other people to join the Seagoing Cowboys Program is it's a good way to bond with animals, and you would get to see some cool places around the world that you can't see at home.

In the story it says that Luke got to see the Acropolis in Greece, and he got to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

They traveled on the ship alot, so they had alot of time with the animals, since they took care of them. I think that if I were in the story I would join the Seagoing Cowboys Program because I like taking care of animals, and I like traveling and seeing new places.

I dont know if going to war would be so great, but it would be like serving your country, even if the most that you're doing is taking care of some animals. you still had a part in serving your country and that's all that matters.

Luke joined the Seagoing Cowboys Program because he wanted to help people, and besides helping people he also got the benefit of seeing Europe and China. He also got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Luke got to see some extrordinary places that some day I'd like to see too. And I know many others that would like to see some nice places too. These are just a few reasons why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program, but I'm sure there are alot more resons why you should join. Why'll Luke was on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful for the oppurtunity,"" Luke said. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.     ",3
2cf54a7,"Driverless cars were once just a concept, however with growing technology this concept is becoming a reality. The ideas of completely autonomous cars could never be fulfilled because of the lack of technology in the past. Today, our technology has grown with the development of various gadgets that could aid in the introduction of autonomous cars to the world.

I believe the idea of driverless cars can become a reality and I am not opposed to it. However, there are issues that need to be ironed out before this idea can become a reality. First of all, the prices of these cars may not be very low, in fact, they most likely will be extremely expensive due to all of the technology being applied to the vehicles. In accordance with these high prices, the amount of consumers purchasing these cars may be very little. If there is a small amount of people in driverless cars, this means that there is a large amount of people driving themselves. This introduces the question of human error. Although the idea seems ideal, you have to put into account the fact that there will be human and driverless car interaction on the roads. The question I prompt is whether these cars will be able to handle situations in which there is human error. If the developers of this product can think of a way to prevent encounters of human error, I would fully support their ideas.

The idea of driverless cars is a reality that I think should come true, under the circumstances that they are completely safe. Currently these cars require a small amount of human action, for example the cars require someone to control them when driving in conditions that need more maneuvering than the car can handle on its own. If the cars can become completely autonomous, perhaps they can be an invention that could solve a plethora of problems. For example, traffic. These cars could greatly reduce commutes to people's jobs or schools and much more. The reasoning behind this is that traffic is almost always due to accidents occurring in busy areas. These cars can reduce the amount of human error on the roads by reducing the amount of humans driving on the roads. These cars could increase the safety of everyone on the road. In addition to safety, drivers hand would be open much more often allowing them to be productive on their commutes, however, if complete autonomy is not achievable, drivers must remain focused on the roads at all times.

The article suggests that these cars could reduce the amount of gas being consumed suggesting a way for consumers to save money over time, adding to the list of pros autonomous cars can provide.

Although the idea of autonomous cars seems far fetched, it is actually in the near future. Perhaps one day the whole world will be operating on driverless cars. Today, there are cars that are extremely close to driving completely on their own, imagine in the future when these cars are able to achieve complete autonomy. This future you are imagining is not that far away, in fact, it is almost here.",4
adc6971,"The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. This face has only come out once and we have not found any other faces planted on Cydonia, the region the face was located at. The face has been fading, There is no real proof of the face being kept there by aliens, and there was no alien momunment after all.

One reason is that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because the face has been fading. The text states that they have tooken pictures of this Face on Mars and both times they have the face becomes unnoitcable. For Example: When one of the people went out and took a picture, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West.""

Another reason for the Face on Mars to be just a natural landform is because of no real proof leading to aliens being there. The passage states that no aliens have interloped the area or anything. The text showed that overtime the face has deceased of showing up. The Garvin states that the Face has come down to looking like ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

My final reason that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform is that there was no alien momunment or alien archifact. The text states that on April 5, 1998 they got the first really well took picture of the Face on Mars. When they uploaded the picture, nothing of the sort of alien industry being there. The text also stated, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monunment after all.""

It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows - even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!""

I think that changing to election by popular vote is the best thing to do. We vote and see which ones most popular and that's who gets to be president. Because more people think he'll be a better president. Another reason is that's what people want. Lastly we wont make the wrong choice. We vote and see who's the best but also theres an election process. We think it would be better with no election process at all. I was imformed that we dont really vote for president, we vote for a slate of 34 democratic pledged to that person. so basicaly were not really voting so and so for president. So it seems like the govenment is fooling us. i just think we the people should vote for president not a slate but the president. and whom ever has the most popular votes wins.

3d32b8a,"The author presents their own opinion on why we should investigate Venus for human civilization. In each paragraph that the author writes, they explain in detail the pros and cons about the study of Venus. Using the knowledge that they have of the planet, many of the ideas that they present give the idea that they are determined to give us the reason to agree with him.

The first idea that they auther states is that Earth, Venus, and Mars are all very close in terms of density and size, and is very close in orbit as well. This leads to Earth sending spacecrafts to land on Venus to gain research on the other planet, but each time, the spacecraft only has limited time to gain research because of the harsh conditions. This gives the author a way of explaining the details of Venus in a descriptive way. Venus has an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide, clouds with highly corrosive sulfuric acid, the average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure is 90 times greater than Earth.

Even with the highly hostile environment, the author explains why astronomers are still trying to visit the planet. The author explains how Venus may have been like Earth in terms of nature. Their detailing explains how Venus was possibly covered largely with oceans and had the same ability as Earth by being able to support forms of life. The author also states that when Venus is close to Earth's orbit, astronauts can easily fly to it's surface and land.

Throughout the essay, the author explains the difficulties and how we can get past inhabiting Venus. He describes in many ways how landing on the planet can be beneficial for research and living conditions. ",3

47eeda2,"The advantages of limiting car usage are overwhelming. Even so much as a car-free day as Bogota Columbia has been doing for the past three years is majorly beneficial. Limiting car usage has been sweeping around the world. It is stated that ""passenger cars are responsible for almost 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the United States. This indicates that the continuous usage of all these automobiles needs to be acknowledged and limited.

Located in Vauban, Germany is a suburb where there are no cars and life goes on, according to Elisabeth Rosenthal. A resident of the suburb, Heindrun Walter, says,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This movement of separating suburban life from auto use is called ""smart planning"", and is a growing trend in the United States and Europe (Rosenthal 5). In the passage it clearly says that ""...as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles...chatter of wandering children drown our the occasional distant motor."" This fantasy like state is possible with the cutting of auto usage.

Paris, France had a partial driving ban enforced when they had days of near record pollution in the air. By doing so Robert Duffer writes,""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"". With this information the thought that the car gas emissions were obviously a huge component in the horrible pollution comes about. On the other hand in Bogota, Columbia they are and have been having a car-free day by choice. The turnout was large even with gray skies and showers. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" says Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Another person, Carlos Arturo Plaza, said,""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" while riding his bike with his wife. The city's parks and sport centers have been blooming along with the construction of sidewalks and new restuarants and shopping areas, writes author Andrew Selsky. This is important because it shows the beneficial and positive outcomes limited car using has. Not only is it neccessary for you but it is essential to the world and atmosphere around us.

Lastly, in the United States President Obama has been working hard to curb the greenhouse gas emissions. Many statistics have come down showing that America's love affair with its vehicles is cooling, according to Rosenthal. Sociologists have said that is this pattern presists the implications will be beneficial to the environment. Many young people now do not make driving one of their priorities. They organize to car-pool or take public transportation to get to where they need to go. The reality of it is if you can do something to help a major crisis in this world and give yourself an advantage they why not do it? Limiting car usage is more important than you think, and without doing so you can miss out on major opportunity, motivation, and forward moving.                                     ",3
c0f71ee,"The Electoral College. The electoral college is ,to the office of federal register, ""Is a process, not a place"", which, in reality, it is. The electoral college is something that the founding fathers established for a choice of voting. You can either vote your election in congress or by a vote of the citizens. In my opinion, I don't really think that this is a good idea. No one really knows who's voting for who. And most of the time, voters don't always control who they get to vote for. But this can be a good thing sometimes because it helps keep everything in order.

First of all, the electoral college is a bad thing because nobody really knows who's voting for who. Most of the time, soem voters get confused about the whole thing and end up voting for the wrong person. During the election, most people get, as I said before, confused. These people get confused because there's too much going on. theres one side voting for one person, the other side voting for the other, then out of nowhere here comes like, 3 more people that are racing, and no one even knew whos these people were because everyone is too caught up with the states votes being all over the place to focus on anything else.

Secondly, I really think that the electoral college is not that good of an idea because most people that are voting don't even get a choice on who they want to vote for. The legislative branch is technically suppossed to choose the electors of the state. The electors are the people who allow peoples votes to go through. They pretty much just sit there and say if your vote counts. And sometimes it doesn't count. If it doesn't, they just give you to the other candidate. So you really don't have a choice to as to which candidate you vote for or not.

However, this could be a good thing.    ",3

2874df1,"The use of technology in a classroom is very useful; but what about the use of technology in order to detect the emotions in a classroom? In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", you learn about a technology called Facial Action Coding System. This system uses facial expressions in order to detect a human emotions. This can be very useful and beneficial in a classroom setting. Students become bored or confused during a lesson and a teacher can't always tell whats going on behind the stares of students, so this system can be very valuable in the learning process.

In the article, paragraph six, Dr. Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This supports the idea that teaching with a system like Facial Action Coding in a classroom can be very accurate and beneficial to a student. A lesson can become personalized to the particular student; unlike regular computer lessons that have no control or idea on how well the student is understanding a lesson. Learning can become more interesting to a student if they realize that their attention habits are being paid attention to rather than just ignored. This concept could be more effective than even regular classroom teaching. A teacher cannot always pin point the students that are having a hard time paying attetion or even the ones that are just confused with a lesson. With this system, the students needs will always be accomedated to.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would be a very valuable technology in a classroom. Students lessons can be modified according to the mood they are in. If they are zoning out, the coding system will be able to recognize this and switch the lesson to a more engaging activity so the student doesn't lose interest in learning. If a student is even feeling sad , maybe the system can notify an instructor and they can arrange a break for the student because the mental health of a student is always important too. Emotions of a child in a classroom affects their attention and productivity emensly, this system can be used to their benefit.",3
1b0676e,"I agree with the claim against the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. First off, we perform these calcutions everyday, as we can tell if our friend is happy or sad by looking at their face most of the time. Also, video imagery tells us that the facial emotions for each emotion are universal. Another big reason is that we really don't know just how much computers can do, it can be where computers detect whether you're happy or sad.

Performing this calculation every day, we would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. However, we can also use human anatomy to help paint precisely enough to convey specific emotions. New computer software has anatomical information as electronic code. Video imagery which is the new emotion-recognition software which tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. The software can detect mixed emotions by weighing the different units. We really don't know how much the computer can do, it can detect if you're happy or sad, and make computer-animated faces.

In a whole, this is a lot to disagree with, since computers are taking over our world now so I believe this is a great idea. Reason being is that we have video imagery, the amazing and undiscovered knowledge of a computer, and our own brains because we calculate expressions on our own every day. These our all major factors that align with the fact that I believe technology should be able to read students' emotional expressions.",2
d9597ce,"In society today us humans often have trouble with reading another person's emotions, we tend to think the person is happy when they're truly mad. Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, has made a computer software with a feature able to scan one's face and present its facial expressions. Although this idea may seem like a technological breakthrough, think of the pros and the cons. The disadvantages out-weigh the benefits in this idea, thinking you know one's emotions because of a machine created by imperfect humans does not mean it is one hundred percent correct.

Computers will never be humans, they will never have the human qualities we have. Thomas says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (D'Alto 6). What if the student isnt really bored like the machine thinks? The machine will make a false adjustment that could do the complete opposite of what the kids wanted. Some deceitful kids could out-smart the machine and fake boredom all the time to make the machine adjust and change everything. Not only that, different kids won't have the same emotion. If half the class is bored and half is having fun, what will the machine do then?

Although Thomas thinks he knows every expression and how to get anyone's true expressions, he is mistaken. All humans have different shapes, sizes, colors, and abilities. This machine will never be able to guess true emotions. Humans express things in totally opposite ways. Altough Mona Lise looks happy in the picture, she could really be faking it. The only correct way to know one's true emotions is not by calculating percentages with a machine, its by expressing your feelings to one another. I can see what's going on in this world, we rely and dwell on technology. As a planet we really do not have enough good quality human interactions, so why improve communication between people and computers as thomas says. Humans are constantly competing and at war, adding this technology will just be giving humans excuses and false assumptions. We should start on using technology to improve human interactions instead of using technology to improve our human interactions.

Basing a decision off of an imperfect machine will get you nowhere but making false assumptions and incorrect decisions. Not everyone is the same, nor will they ever be. Expressing your true feelings through words is better than a machine thinking someone feels a certain way. Also, not everyone feels the same way and this machine will cause trouble if a person purposely changes a way they look. This idea will never work because us humans are not all nice people. Men and women need to work on communicating with other humans and not technology. Countries are at war and some people are worrying about creating technology to better computer and human communication. Differences, deception, irresponsibility and disrespectfulness amongst humans are why this idea of reading one's emotions will never work and will constantly make errors leading to a downfall in our society.

b8103da,"Dear Florida State Senator,

Every 4 years, many people vote for a president they think will lead the United States to greatness; some, however, don't know that they are voting for the Electoral College to vote on their choise. This act of using the Electoral College is, by definition, not democratic. Didn't our founding fathers create this country promising democracy and people representation? They did, and that is why the Electoral College must crumble. Florida State Senator, we need to change how our country votes on its leader; we need to use popular vote for the president of the United States because this method is more democratic, the people representing the  Electoral College are flawed humans, and the nature of this type of election forces some states to be ignored. Florida State Senator, you must take action against the flawed Electoral College!

Because of the function of the Electoral College, the people aren't truly represented for. According to Source 2, the voters--the ones supposedly voting for our new president--vote for a group of electors instead. Due to the power of the Electoral Colleg, electors can vote for any candidate. This process we have every 4 years is truly un-democratic. For example, during the 2000 election, Al Gore was the candidate with the most popular votes--this meant that the majority of the citizens of the U.S. wants him to be president. However, Al Gore lost since the majority of electors from the Electoral College voted him. Lastly, in the case of a time, the lection will truly be un-democratic; the House of Representatives will have to choose the new president. The people may allow continued usage of the imperfect Electoral College, but there is still one major problem: the Electoral College is made up of flawed, easily manipulated humans.

According to Source 1, the electors are made up of people chosen by the candidate's political party. Immediately, these electors can easily decide on the candidate to vote on; it's just the matter of the amount of electors each candidate has. Also, the electors are human beings, and everyone knows that humans are flawed creatures. According to Source 2, electors have been replaced to be against the opposing candidate or wait until the last minute to vote. Although, according to Source 3, the electors are chosen and are given trust, others can still influence them. Candidates or even political parties can influence the electors to vote for their chosen person. Lastly, Florida State Senator, the nature of the Electoral College forces some states to be ignored.

Florida State Senator, as you may know, the candidate for presidency usually go to the ""swing"" states to win ""the people's"" vote. People, however, from the non-swing states are generally ignored. During the 2000 election, 17 states weren't even able to see a candidate they are voting for the title of president. Although it is understandable that candidates go to the ""swing"" and populous states, there is no excuse for ignoring thousands of people from the small states. The president of the United States is the president for an entire country, not just a region of it. Voters from the non-swing states will still want to see the candidate to decide on who to vote for, even though they aren't voting for the actual candidate. The Electoral College is imperfect and un-democratic!

In conclusion, the Electoral College and its electors must be disbanded so that popular vote will be used in determining the new president of the United States. According to both Source 2 and 3, the process of voting a group of people to vote for you is un-democratic. Electors, the people making up th Electoral College, can be manipulated and coerced into voting a specific candidate. Lastly, non-swing states will be ignored; this will anger and frustrate them since not one candidate tried to persuade them. Florida State Senator, you must, in the best of your ability and then some, try to topple down the un-democratic roots of the Electoral College. The people, the ones who must truly decide on the president, will be immensely greatful towards you; in a 2000 poll, 60% of the voters even stated that they want a popular-vote type of election. Florida State Senator, I implore to you, abolish the Electoral College in the same manner as with slavery. Many people will thank you!    ",6
692a8e5,"I believe that the integration of driverless cars into the current-day road system would only pose a threat to the majority of drivers. Incorporating a new form of transportation into a pre-existing form would only complicate the roads more than before. Cars have been around for roughly 100 years and society has adapted to this certain form of transportation that is used world-wide. Although driverless cars seems very advanced and the engineering involved in their production is beyond my imagination, driverless cars will have a negative effect on the current-day road system.

Being a teenager, I am approaching a new level of responsibility and encountering a world very foreign to me, driving. Having the ability to drive brings a whole new world of responsibility to teens all over the United States. Although there are many teen fatalities due to driving, I believe that driverless cars will not thoroughly incorporate the new level of responsibility that teens have as they approach legal driving age.

Another aspect of my argument pertains to the current driving and road laws. The reading states that a majority of the driving laws are focused on keeping drivers and their passengers aware that safety is achieved through alertness. Traffic laws are formed based on the idea that human drivers are in control at all times. Integrated driverless cars will interfere with the traffic and road laws that are in place today. If driverless cars became the popular form of transportation, would new traffic laws be incorporated to adjust to the new form transportation? Or since driverless cars are operated by computers, would there be the need for traffic laws at all?

Although driverless cars could bring a very efficient form of transportation, they seem to add too much technology to a long-lasting form of transportation. Driverless cars will take away the aspect of great responsibility from teens and new drivers as a whole. And driverless cars will only complicate rules, laws, and regulations of our road system that have been in place for decades. Ultimately, how much are we as a human race willing to give up to technology?",4
b0faa1d,"Abolishing the Electoral College

Every four years a new president is elected to run the United states of America. Which is caried out by a process called Electoral College Process. It is a meeting of various electors,in where they vote for President and Vice President. I firmly believe that this process should be abolished, and the President and Vice President should be chosen by popular votes.

For starters, the leader of the free world should be choosen directly by the American citizens. It must bruise like a birthday punch to know those who waited in lenghty lines for hours upon end, didn't obtain the President they bargined for because of electoral votes rather than popular. It is stated that ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now""

Source 2 Paragraph 9.

More than half of America's citizens would prefer direct election. So why aren't the officials giving America what they want? Possiblity to hold us captive in the ""free world"".

Another reason why the Electoral College process should be abolished, is the fact that we the people have to trust a complete stranger. Trusting a complete stranger with hands of your future is a difficult task to do. Seeing that most people in possession of power got there using propaganda. Posner believes that ""each party selcts a sdlate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)...""

Source 3 Paragraph 16 . How is he completly sure about this? Hitler decieved his people and promised them ""better days"", and we all know how that went. The Elctoral College process is just not trustworthy.

All in all the Electoral College should be abolished and replaced with direct elections. This gives citizens more control over who they elect (which is supposed to happen in a Democracy). The people now freedom of choice, and the majority would be happy with the new leader of the free world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ",3
69654af,"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Nick D'Alto introduces a new idea of using computers to intepret emotions from facial expressions. Dr. Thomas Huang envisions a possibility in which online classrooms could use facial analysis in order to more effectively instruct students. However, despite the possible benefits facial analysis could provide online classrooms, things like privacy, practicality, and effectiveness are obstacles that must be addressed.

Privacy has long been one of the post important aspects of life. The same holds true for the internet as well. People value their anonymity, and they often go online in order to be someone else - someone different than they are in real life. Facial recognition requires access to the face, something many internet users are not fond of allowing, especially on the internet where everything is effectively open. Counterarguments might say that online classrooms could keep images of faces secret and secure, but every since the invention of technology, hackers, crackers, and similar people have always been able to exploit security issues and gain access to the databases with images of faces. Many people would rather no one see their faces and have no customized ads or information as opposed to having a computer know ""when [they're] happy or sad."" While facial analysis may prove to be quite a useful and revolutionary technology, many users would forever remain wary that their privacy (and their face) might be compromised.

Praticality also remains an issue for would-be-users of this technology. As D'Alto writes, not everyone's ""home PC [can] handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (and subsequently their own). Many would be unwilling to buy a more powerful PC simply to allow the facial analysis software to work. While most, if not all, people acknowledge that education is important, powerful PC's often cost over one thousand dollars, a price that many are unable or unwilling to pay for a convenient online education. Also, there remains the issue of the technology itself. How would it be distributed? Would it be software or would it be built into computers? Would there be a price tag attached? These are all questions that affect how practical this technology is. Imagine people empty their wallet of a couple thousand dollars only to find that the algorithm only comes preinstalled on certain computers, or is incredibly buggy and doesn't work properly. People might argue that users should educate themselves on how the system works before even considering buying the product, but often, for products like this, the information is woefully incomplete or exaggerated. Until the technology can become accessible to the average everyday user, it will fail to successfully be implemented in online classrooms.

Lastly, there remains the question of truly how effective it would be. Softwares relating to human qualities are often rather inconsistent and require extensive testing. Emotions are also a tricky thing, as people sometimes try to hide them or fake them. While D'Alto states that ""to an expert, faces don't lie,"" in a educational setting, that often doesn't matter. Most students are often relatively reluctant to learn, possibly putting their face in a perpetual cycle of anger, disgust, sadness, or even fear. In school, education carries on regardless of emotional state. While teachers do care about the emotional wellbeing of their students, they still must teach like the do any other. In general, emotions are often ignored in the face of studying and education - students study what they need to, no questions asked. This raises the question of truly how useful would facial analysis be in an online classroom? There isn't much computers can do to adjust to human emotions. Computers also lack a soul, so they therefore lack emotions and empathy and sympathy. Without those, how could they possibly understand what a student needs? Humans, as D'Alto states, indeed ""perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" However, humans can also react much more appropriately. Also, there is no guarantee that the technology would read emotions correctly. And unlike fingerprint scanners or facial recognition, there is no second chance with emotions. Either the computer interprets them incorrectly or correctly. The fact remains that having a facial recognition from an online, unemotional avatar simply would not provide many advantages over a regular online classroom.

Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" provides a detailed analysis of a new, potentially revolutionary technology that could prove incredibly useful in future projects. Facial analysis has the potential to totally revamp our online experience. However, the online classroom isn't one of those places. Due to privacy, praticality, and effectiveness issues, facial analysis seems to be a ratherless worthless technology to implement in an online classroom.",6
b1be3e3,"Driverless cars are not neccisarly and reasonable because they are very dangerous. Driverless cars is something that is only going to be used because they want to make more money and have it to keep updated with the new generation and how we work. Many would and dont support this because mainly they see it as more issues coming and something that's going to cause a problem later on. Although, the car is going to have some postive things like notifying the driver when they are about to hit something or even like how ahead of the road it may be construction going on so they have to turn around it's not enough good reasons to fully persuade others why we should allow this. How would we feel if everytime we got into our car it toke the most control and had charge of everything?.

Eventhough, a lot of people may support this and think ""yes we should do it!"" is because they are looking at it or have been pursuaded that its going to fix all problems. The new

law

that was made was

no talking and driving

on the phone or texting and driving so people made a car where you could have a speaker phone when someone call you so it would be easier. The more problems that is known is more ideas

people have so they create a new car or a new material. People may look at it like simplier ways for them driving but not too many look into it and notice that it doesn't always help the problem because most of the time it just created more issues that we have to solve and get rid of

.

The good

things about "" Driverless Cars""

is it's something new and better. We

are looking at it as a second hand to help out and tell me when something is wrong. They are percieving it as a car that is looking out and knows best because it's looking out at all angles and directions. The good things about it is yes, we are not able to see everything around us or even hear everything so if a car tells us something we do not know or didn't realize then great ! it helps. The car will have a GPS which is a bonus because not everyone knows their directions to all places if we get lost then what not too many people we know that would help us or even know the place we are trying to go.

The Main reason why ""Driverless Cars"" should not be approved and used is because it's not 100% trustworthy. They may see it as and percieve it as something better and helpful but they are wrong. If, they already got states where they made it illegal to even test computer- driven cars then thats a reason right there. Therefore, if ""Driverless Cars"" is something thats so good and help people they should have everyone on their side about it. It's too much going on that they have placed in the car having all that could make more damage.It will distract the driver by everything they are trying to do on top of worrying about what the car have to say about their

surroundings, directions, and more.

It's more painful and dangerous having many things going on in the car then just having a regular car. Some people may even see this as as the driver being lazy because if they are being told then that means they will be less alert and less focus on what's happening because they will say well i have my car that's going to tell me everything i need to know. Some will get too comfortable with this and when they don't have it anymore they will be lost. Mainly, because there is always new drivers they don't need new technology to tell them everything because they need to learn by themselves.          ",4
c816199,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it discusses the possibility of cars that humnas do not have to drive are coming. Driverless cars are not a smart choice for drivers shoud make. There are too many risks of dangerous incidents that could happen that could caused danger to other drivers and the drivers would lose the freedom from driving their own vehicle. Driverless cars are not a smart investiment because it only prolongs the laziness of today's people.

A car was made for there to be human control over it; that is the reason that the ""driverless"" cars that have already been created have not been completely driverless. The car needs that control from a being with feelings and not just a computer. This argument could be the same as the argument over robots; should robots be a common household item? The argument being robots having no feelings and not understnading everything humans do. Say for instance scientist and enginers do create a ""driverless"" car in paragragh 7 it states that, ""Manufaturters are also considering using cameras to watch that drivrs are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver""(Driverless Cars Are Coming). So even though these cars are suppose to be driving themselves they still need the driver to be able to take over at any point during the ride. That is not be a ""driverless"" car. Futhermore, paragraph 8 states, ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?""(Driverless Cars Are Coming). It continues on to say, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?""(Driverless Cars Are Coming). But the question stands; why would someone want to wait on a car that at any point would need the driver to take over, which could be extremely dangerous, when they could be driving the enitre time and would not not have to worry about any of that? They would not because it makes no sense to put their life and the people around them lives in danger when they could just continue to drive their own vehicle just as they and everyone else have for centries.

In conclusion, the concept of a ""driverless"" car should stay just that a concept. It is not a smart descion to make and it only put the lives of everyone around in danger. Driverless cars are not only driverless but they are also careless; there is not any emotion behind a streering wheel if there is not a human being behind it. A computer does not know what to do in the different aspects the roads throw at drivers, like humans do. The driverless car should not be a development that should be taken seriously any time soon because it is extremeley dangerous and the cost of hospital bills from the incidents with a driverless car are going to be well over the cost of making them.",4
bf2ebc7,"Leonardo De Vincis famous painting is the Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa is known all over the world today. There has been many of debates about weather she is smiling or if she has any eyebrows. It took Leo to paint the hands 4 years alone.

Today Thomas Huang has now made an invention. Huang has came up with a technology called Facial Action Coding System which is where computers can caculate up the real emotions of a student or person. Studies show that this technology system can read all your emotions you're feeling. It can tell if you're sad,happy,angry and lots more of emotions. Huang states in the text that they tell your emotions by the muscles on your face.

Huang also goes on saying that he can pin point out emotins on kids in school. In my defence I dont this this would work accuratley. Not only do i think it would work. Many of teacher would not want to get out that device in the middle of class just to see your kids emotions. Many of kids fake smile or act like they are happy when really they are not. Studies show that they are identified by the muscles but you could easlily get told to smile which changed your muscles which changed the game.

Many of student come to school depressed or upset. Many of teacher do not know if they are really happy or not. This technology I feel would not be valuable because maybe the student do not want people to know there emotions. Emotions should be kept private and with this technology it would be open to everyone in a classroom.

Overall I feel like this would not benifit anything. I also feel like this would not be valuable to students in classrooms. Therefore This technology may help on paints. One example is the Mona Lisa but not on humans because this could lead to not there real emotions.      ",3
dd7fb1a,"""Driverless cars"" sound good until you're in an accident situation and you get blamed. What about people who enjoy driving and traveling for a living? That joy is just going to be tooken away because some people are too lazy to drive their self where they need to go. Then whjen this happens, people start falling asleep at the wheel and not being able to be alerted when the car needs an actual human.

I think driverless cars would be pointless. Like stated in the article ""Would'nt drivers get bored waiting for thier turn to drive?"" A person like me loves to drive and I would'nt want a car doing it for me. Plus when its an accident or road construction the car would'nt know what to do if the driver couldnt be alerted. It would be so much confusion and problems on the road with driverless cars. But the big focus that was mentioned is ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or manufacture?"" 9/10 I think it would be put on the driver but in rememberence its called a DRIVERLESS car. I dont think this idea is just something we need.

If people would really stop and think about how many problems this would bring and not just about how cool it is then they would see all the problems it would bring before it's here. Or maybe they should create this car so they can bump their head on how they are using technology in all the wrong ways.",2
86ad427,"Driving a car is not a necessity in life and countries are starting to realize that. A car is merely ""just a means of getting from [point] A to B"" (Source 4). The stress and pollution caused by these vehicles is not worth it for some countries. They would rather have less stressed people, less pollution and less traffic accidents and congestion in the streets.

Germany believes that the lifestyle of driving a car is not neccessary. ""There are only two places to park - large garages [] where a car owner can buy a space"" (Source 1) These parking spaces cost $40,000, and the car owner buys this space along with a house. As a result of this phenomenon ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars"" (Source 1) and 57 percent of people sold their car and chose to move to Vauban, Germany. Cars are ""responsible for 12 percent of greehouse gas emissions in Europe"" (Source 1). Yet there have been efforts to lower the greenhouse gases, Vauban put a stop to cars to make the citites nice, and better for walking.

Paris is one of the most known tourist destinations in the world. People cluster in from around the world to see the Effiel Tower, which stands straight into the sky. Their main tourist attraction is a monument that goes into the sky. No wonder they want to cut down on cars' pollution. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"" (Source 2).

A home to 7 million people, Bogota, Colombia is trying to spread their program globally and reduce the pollution from the once nessecary cars. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"" (Source 3). Violaters are faced with $25 fines. In a car free day, ""the turnout was large"" (Source 3). It is believed to be a great oppurtunity to relieve stress and lower air pollution. Bogota's program is ""generating a revolutionary change"" (Source 3) and the idea is spreading across borders.

""America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling"" (Source 4). The United States is one of the top most prosperous countries in the world and the culture revolves around transportation. Americans depend on their cars to help them preform their daily lives. The explaination of the ""cooling of vehicles"" is a result of unemployment and the recession. Many Americans are ""cash-strapped"" (Source 4), and cannot afford new cars. If the pattern of car ownership continues to decrease, it will benefit the environment with less pollution and car emissions. But, a negative results for the car industry's.

08fbb47,"Is it possible to be too passionte about something? This author wrote an entire article on how challenging but worth it, it would be to visit Venus' crtiical atmosphere. How well does the author describe, or explain, their own opinion? They support this idea very thoroughly by these three things: The idea that life could have lived there before, the conditions are inhumane, and the fact that it could gain insight and can settle our curiosity.

To start, the idea that at one point in time there has acutally been life living on that planet is crazy. In paragraph four, it talks about how at on point there may have been big oceans like that are similar to the ones on earth. We think this because there are many rocky surfaces, such as valleys, mountains, and craters, that can only be formed from water eriodication. When you even look at it, it just look earth like. Obviously it has changed over the years but you can't rule it out. Is it possible there were living things on this planet at once?

Secondly, now the conditions are inhumane. How did they get that way? Paragprah three is all about what it is like on Venus. The temperatures now rise over eight-hundred degrees Fahrenheit. The air is absolutely unbreathable as it is made up of ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide. Not only is there carbon dioxide floating around in the air, the atmosphere is mostly made up of sulfuric acid which is very toxic to be breathing in that much. The air pressure on Venus is ninety times deeper, or stronger, than the bottom of sea level. If we even tried ot land on Venus none of the metals would last in eight-hindred degrees. There are also many impediments such as erupting volacnos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting. Minus all these problems we would have to find a way around, the author believes that it is still worth it to visit Venus.

Lastly, we would gain so much insight and our curioustiy could be settled. Paragraph eight talks all about this and about how this could open the doors for us to learn new ideas and come up with new technology that could even help up here on Earth. They also state in paragraph eight to support the idea that despite Venus' risky conditions it would still make a worthy pursuit by saying, and I qoute, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Which I interpret as do not let these conditions scare us. We are so smart and we can be creative and find a way around all of these 'problems'.

In conclusion, how opinionated and factual can someone be? How do you know to balance these two things? At times we have to be one-hundred percent curious about what we are writing about because you don't want to write an article on something you don't care about or find important. Overall, how detailed and opionated was the author? In the end, I think that the author did a great job at explaining why they think it would be a worthy pursuit. Do you?",5
3643a55,"In movie's robots are shown to have less emotion then a brick. However what if we could change that and make them not only capable of expressing emotion, but also reading it! That is why I am for this idea, this is easily the next step to creating a robot that acts like a human! The sheer amount of other possible uses are nearly endless!

Tired of watching and seeing the same add you don't like? This can fix the problem! the platform running the video (for example, youtube) could find out how much you liked the add before and after, using this information, they can write an algorithem to see what ads you like and don't like and see. Running a school filled with computers? Have the lesson teach itself by keeping the student entertained! As said by dr. Huang ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"".

Hospitals could use emotion to check how a patient is feeling. if they're sad the camera will tell them. are they in pain? the camera can tell them. The knowledge of emotion just by seeing the patient's face in a camera reduces the need for nurses and allows a hospitel to hold more patients. maybe in the far future, we could have medical assistants, like baymax from big hero six, who could act as an automated doctor or nurse. need an example? in december of 2017 the flu broke out killing more then 500 people, if hospitals would've had more room, it could saved 80% of the people who died from the flu that year.

The sheer amount of uses are too vast! Ads could finnally maintain revelancy. Teachers could be replaced by good programmers, hospitals could save more lives than ever! I feel that the downsides, if any, Are complete obsolete when compared to the upside. I think we all should focus on the study of emotion and learn how much it can help. ",3
e3901bf,"Venus is a dangerous planet, despite being called the ""Evening Star"", that scientists want to get more information about. Venus is the brightest ""star"" we see in the night sky, and tht's how it got it's nickname. This is caused by the extreme amount of heat that is being emitted into the atmosphere of space. The author suggests that Venus should be studied, decpite the dangers, because scientists believe it was once like Earth, NASA suggests having scientists floating above the fray, and NASA is trying to make technology for safer research, so that humanity can learn more about the solar system and find new dicoveries on other planets.

First and foremost, scientists belive this 800 degree planet once held life forms like the ones a person would see on Earth. In paragraph 4, the author states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" Then the author talks about the different types of rocks and land forms, as well as the fact that it's the ""nearest option for a planetary visit."" This explains how Venus could have once been like Earth at one point. Nasa has a couple interesting ways of seeing if these theories are fact or fiction.

Secondly, NASA is thinking of different ways to study Venus. In paragraph 5, the author proclaims, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehical hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehical hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" Soon, the author writes about the temperature and the pressure these people would have to deal with. This would show that NASA is thinking of sending scientists above the fray to observe Venus. If sending humans doesn't work out, technology will save the day, or research in this case.

Lastly, NASA wants to also try out technology to study Venus from a safe place, back on Earth. In paragraph 7, the author states, ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexable, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme conditions. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" Earlier in the same paragraph, the author is putting that people have alredy tried to make some kind of technological device that can withstand the forces Venus throws at them. This shows that NASA is working on the technological approach to gain more knowledge of Venus.

All in all, Venus is a dangerous planet that scientists are curious to study and understand. The author believes it's a worthy pursuit, despite the inhospitable conditions because it's simular to the Earth, and NASA is trying to send people and technology up into space so they cay study the planet, so people can learn about the solar system and the planets. This is how great scientists are created, by studying the impossible.",4

1b8ff62,"Alright, so this facial emotional technology that's supposed to know your emotion based on your facial expressions is wack. The articles says something about how being able to read student's emotions in class is valuable.

The article states that the computer will read a students emotion and modify the lesson if they seem bored or confused. Okay so if the student is confused there needs to be a more simple way to put the lesson. How will the computer decide wich way is more simple. what if its more simple way is actually more confusing. Or lets say the student is bored, we have the same problem. There isnt much a computer can do to make it more fun. I mean can you even make it more fun besides just wording it differently? It isnt an effective way to do it and even harder for a computer to do so. Its far easier for a human instructor to word the lesson differently than a computer because the computer lacks the real connection that a person can have with you.

Then theres is chance that the students emotion isnt even related to the lesson, but may be from the outside. Maybe they got mad at someone, a loved one died, a breakup maybe, or even thiers parents got divoreced. Not only would it be hard for a computer to determine the emotion is caused by an outside force but even to figure a way to help. The technology may even be wasted on helping students when there could be better use for it.

The article doesnt give you much evidence as to wether this would help besides saying it will modify the lesson. How, in what way?

Not only would it be difficult to do this, but would it even be effective? So maybe it is a little effective and the computer can put some things on screen to make you happy, but if it isnt that effective then there is no good uses for it and no one will use it. If you are creating something that can add value or help people in some way, it cant just be barely effective or even just a little. The cost of making this, testing it, and everything else going into the program, and for it to just kind of work is not an effective way to help people or even get them to consider to use it because it will just waste their time more than anything.

At the end of the day we humans have too complex emotions to create something to not only recongnize our emotions (which is the easier part), but to help us when feeling negative emotions.",4

As one of the people living in Florida I am honor to have the opportunity to wirte you this letter telling you about what I think about keeping the Electoral College. For numerous reasons I think we have a better outcome of getting the candidate we want if we keep the Electoral College method to vote for our candidates.Does reasons are : certanity of outcoem, Everyone's president, and swing states.

Paragraph 1

Topic: Certainty of outcome

Support: Problems over Electoral College is possible but not as much as problems over popular vote. ""The reason is that winning candidate's share of the winning candidate's share of the Electoral Colleg invariably exceeds his share of popular vote"".This also benefits small states. In addition the is a possibility to have a tie in nationwide electoral vote "" because the total number of votes-538-is an even number, but it is highly unlikely..""

Paragraph 2

Topic: Everyone's president

Support: The candidate have to be neutral, it cannot have favorite religion or section of the country because ""The residents of the other regions ae likely to feel disenfranshised-to feel that their votes do not count,that the new president will have no regard for their interests,that he really isn't their president"".

Paragraph 3

Topic: Swing States

Support: Candiates most of the time choose to focused more on the toss-up states because they are ""the most thoughtful voters [and] should be the ones to decide the election"".

Counterargument

""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor"".People are worried that the governmetn will choose for them. They do not realise that if we don't have the electoral college than that is is more than likely to happen because the electoral college is what allows us to have a voice, a say, in what we want in our future president.

Conclusion

Keeping the electoral colloge gives the peope the opportunity to choose wisely who they want taking care of them for the next four years.

Then when you turn on the tv use the Facial action coding system.

People sometimes dont know what mood there in at school, some people love coming to school, some hate it, but some people dont like to be bothered. Alot of people like to stay to themselves at school, so maybe using the FACS would make thhat student angry, when probably that person was in a happy mood so it works both ways if you ask me but i really do think the FACS would be good for class rooms.

f3ce714,"Driverless Cars is good way to help a driver when they are tired and they can take a break from the stairing wheel. The good thing about Driveless cars is that they can drive by themself under specific conditions. Google has had driveless cars that have driven more then half a million miles without a crash.

I think it's a good idea to make drivelss cars because it's interesting and this will help people out a lot especially when they are tired of staring the wheel and they need to sit back and relax, but I mean they will still be alerted to take over the wheel when they are dealing with traffic and accidents the care will warn them.

No matter what, theirs always going to be an accident and you can't blame the car for it, accedents happen and it can either be the other person in the other car or you. If you have a driveless car and you are taking a break but you still have the responsibility to stay on tract and have an eye on the road and not be texting it's still dangerous even though if it's a driveless car. Driveless cars can steer, acclerate and brake themselves but they are all designed to notify the driver when its neccasary.

Driveless cars can also help people who don't know how to drive it can help them out if the person is going to fast it can slow them down.

In 2016 Telsa is realeasing a car that is capable of driving outopilot 90% of the time. In 2020 their will be cars like Mercedes, Benz, Audi, and a Nisaan that will be alble to drive by themselves I think have driveless cars is a good idea. ",2

Venus is called Evening star it's one of the brightest points of the light in the night sky. It is going to talk about how it is going to be different there and it's simple to see from earth because it is kinda close.

The National Aeronautics and space administraion(NASA) has an idea of sending humans to go explore Venus to see how it is there. They want to study it so they know how life works there so scientists could know about it. NASA possible solutiin to the hostile conditions on the surface Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. The temperatures woild still be hot at around 170 degrees fahrenheit but the pressure would be close to sea level from earth.

NASA is going to be working on studying venus like some simplified electronics of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulatiing the chaos of venus's surface. So they can get an idea how it is going to be when they get to the surface so they will be ready because they already did some testes for that. The only thing it only lasted for Three weeks in conditions.

There is another project from an old techology called mechanical computers. Computers existing in 1800s may sound shocking but they calulations by using gears and levers they dont not require electroics at all. Now we have computers that are more powerful, flexible, and quick but they tend to delicate when it comes up to extreme physical comditions.

To meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of its insight to be gained on the planet itself. Humans will lead us into many equal intimidating endeavors. On earth shouldn't be limited by dangers and doubts to expanded.

NASA should just study it more to see if there is any danger that can cause to humans. They should do more testes and try out new things and not to be scared of it because if they don't study it well and send people to live there they might now live the best. So NASA did a good thing about sending people to study venus. They will know now what they could had done better for the next time they send humans back there again.         ",3
0a0f7cc,"The author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars but the negative aspects are more compelling. Driverless cars require many sensors, they would still require the help of the human driver and there is always the possibility of the technology failing and cause injury.

The driverless cars that are being tested require many sensors that are needed in order to allow the car to perform the duties of drivering. As it says in the article "" For starters, they needed a whole alot of sensors."" It rises questions like, What if they fail? What would be the cost of replacing broken ones? It a sound too expensive to maintain. Is there an alert system to warn humans a sensor is going out? As driverless cars need sensors they still need the help of the human drivers.

They claim to be driverless cars and yet they arent completely driverless; they still need the asistance of the human drivers. In the article is says "" In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" and ""... but all are designed to nofity the driver when the road ahead requires human skills..."" In how many situations would the so called driveless cars need the human skills to operate and prevent accidents? There is still the need for human judgement.

With automatives there has always been the risk of injury and death which is present in the driverless cars. But who would be at fault as the article says, ""... new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accidents. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-- the driver or the manufacturer?"" Car manufacturers have been in fault for car defects that have resulted in injury or death. With driverless cars the risk could go up with failures in the car.

Even though the thought of having driverless cars is appealing to many, there is many negative aspects to the idea of having them. As driverless cars require many sensors, they would still require

help of the human driver and is always the possibility of the technology failing and cause injury or death. We are still far from the day where people will see driverless cars as an everyday thing.",3
72e4e84,"In the passage the author talks about how venus is really close to earth but humans haven't been there ever due to how dangerous it is. He goes on to say that it is one of the most dangerous plants out there, but they really want to know whats out there. They want to know what it is like there and if there something more out there. Due to the fact that it is so dangerous they can't send a human there to land on the ground, they have come up with an idea about sending a human out there but in a blimp. So normally when they send people into space they land there and are able to step out on the ground and be on the plant but, for venus its a different story. Due to the air and all the chemicals out there we can't land there at all so, they want to send someone out there in a blinp to hover over venus to see whats out there. Venus is one of the most questionable plants due to the fact we have no clue what could be there. NASA is still working on other approaches to study venus. It might take a few years before someone comes up with a way to view venus without having to land on it. These people are willing to do everything it takes to find a way to view venus and find out whats out there. At the end of the passage the author say ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by damgers and doubts but should be expaned to meet the vary edges of imagination and innovation."" and i agree we should know whats out there and be able to explore the world to its full life,becasue we never know what might happen next.",1
198c196,"There are many people in the world who strive to meet their goals, regardless of the dangers it beholds. For the planet, Venus, however, The challenge for studying the planet is a big challenge. There are numerous examples to how studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. They can be communicated through these three instances: Venus has similar traits to earth, it is our closest neighboring planet,

One reason why Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers is becuase of the similar, Earth-like traits it has. Astronomers have made a hypothisis saying that Venus has similar traits to earth, as well as possibly having some sort of lifeforms developing on that planet. ""Astronomers are facinated by venus because it may well once have one well been the most earth-like planet in our solar system"". Despite the challege, Astronomers wish to explore venus to see if the traits on that planet are similar to earth.

Another reason why Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers is because it is are closest neighboring planet. ",2

53eb232,"There was a world before cars. One without polluted air, green house gasses, and holes in the O-ZONE layer. Transportation was done the old fashioned way, with your two legs. Aside from your legs, we now have other methods of transportation aside from legs and motor vehicles, such as bikes. Technology is on the rise.. But are cars on their way down?

A new trend is starting, and like all good trends they have hefty price tag. An excerpt from ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" written by Elisabeth Rosenthal in the

New York Times . In paragraph two it gives an example of the expensive lifestyle to live if you would choose to live with a car, ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park--large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" Not going green comes with a price tag. Residents of this new community are pleased with the cut down on motor vehicles. Less stress, less pollution. According to the text in paragraph five ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe."" 12% may not seem like much, but if you look at the big picture, its quite the amount.

Another issue that is caused by motor vehicles is smog. Smog is what happens when there is fog and a mixure of gasses created by the exhaust in a motor vehicle. Pollution in Paris is at its all time high. In an article from the

Chicago Tribune by Robert Duffer, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" in paragraph eleven says, ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars ar home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to the odd-numbered plates the following day."" This ban gives people the opportunity to cut back on fuel by car pooling, taking public transportation, or riding a bike. Many drivers did not cooperate and approximately 4,000 drivers were fined. Consistency is key, will Paris continue the cut back?

Around the world officials are working to cut back. Bogota, Colombia has the car free program which bans all but busses and taxi's and leaving anyone who doesnt obey to pay a 25$ fine. In an excerpt from ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky written in the

Seattle Times paragraph twent two says, ""The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota."" This shows although there is bad weather people are still set on reducing motor vehicle transportation and decreasing smog. Along with the reduction of car usage Bogota is encouraging sports and outdoor play. Sidewalks have been enlarged and smoothed with leaves way for walkers and bikers. Parks have opened up as well as sports centers.

Are use of motor vehicles really decreasing? In an excerpt from, ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal from the

New York Times in paragraph 41 shows evidence, ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...."" Car culture is ending, and going green has just begun. Around the world from Paris, to Bogota, to the United States we are all cutting back on motor vehicle use. This will be a project that takes many years to finish but with the team work of the world, most definately anything can happen.                                  ",2

It's good that thechnology is advancing and the world is in a better place because of these things. It's not bad that things are starting to change including our daily use cars. It's good to be able to create new things that are interesting and enjoy the things that are being produced. I oppose to this new invension of cars however.

People might be excited hearing these advance technology such as the Driveless Cars that are being introduced. However, I'm against these Driveless Cars that are about to be sold. You might think that cars being controled by itself without the drivers would be facinating and cool for you, but there is also danger ahead of us. Of course, it's the job for the companies to sell out to you and try to earn whatever amount of money they could, it's not their responsibility of driving for us after buying it. The cars are not even fully recommanded by the producers yet; they are finding ways to improve it. However, it's not fully guarantee that we will be safe as long as we are in the car.

It's our choice whether we want to get this new car or not, but know that in your mind there will at least a consequences. These cars are cool and looks awesome in our eyes, nor is a bless to own one. Even so, we should know that these cars are not a hundred percent safe. The text state, "" This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. "" This shows that we also have to ready to take over when something doesn't seem right. It's not like the Driverless Cars will take care of us.

Imagine you are texting while in these Driverless Cars going to your work. You just let the car control when suddenly a road ahead of you is being constrcted, at that moment, you probably might not be alert or anything. The car then had an accident and the one to blame is you, the driver. What I meant to say is that these cars aren't that safe as we think it is. We also have to take the responsible of beingon alert or else something might happen. The text said that if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer? This tells us that it's not guarantee that the manufacturer will take full responsibility of us when somehting bad happens. We have to take care of ourselves.

These Driveless Cars might be convenient in some ways, but always know that it's not always safe. What's the use of always staying on alert when you bought the car thinking it can drive itself without the need of the driver. Even thought it's a fancy thing that the car could drive by itself, it still needs the help of the driver. If something is about to happen in the middle of the highway, what are you going to do? It's really dangerous just thinking about it. Our life really determine on our own actions when driving this Drivelss Cars. Some people might find the cars a good thing, but for me, I really am against it.",4

662781f,"Hve you ever been in an argument before? Well I am goingto try and persuade you that the face are a natural land form.

First I will talk about the way I know that the face are not created by aliens or something. So lets get to it

So now in the paragraph I am going to provide you with facts and details from the rticle of why I think it is a natural land form. First If this really is a face made by aliens or something where is the rest of the body? Also We as on earth NASA says that they have never seen or recorded a real life alien.

If aliens did make this it would be in the news because come on how many aircrafts are sent into space a day most likly about one ever day. And we also have a satilite up in space and I bet you Countries like Russia, Canada, and probaly even the British have one up in space.

And if something like that happened I would hope one of those satilites would see that happing.

And for all you and me now is that are moon has craters in it. Right? So craters happen ever day so could something like this happen I would think so.

And NASA also said that they did there reserach by pictures taken by the space shuttles and very accurte drawing of the ""Face"" not done by conserise theroys.

In conclusion Those were some of my best argument reason of why I think the face is a natural land form not a face that was made by aleins. So thos eare my reasonings. So what do you think it is?",2
29e3246,"Twenty-five years ago a photo was taken of a natural landform that appears to look like a face. Many people will argue that it isn't a natural landform but, more of an alien artifact. While the two sides still don't see eye to eye they both have evidence that could support their belief.

While, some people think that the face on Mars is ""bona-fide evidence"" that there once was life there. NASA has defended that remark by saying that they wish that it was a mark of ancient civilization but, it's not. NASA has also made it a priority to photograph the face because, they felt as if it was ""important to the taxpayers"" to give them evidence that it wasn't an alien landform.

So, in 1998 they flew a shuttle over Cydonia, the face/lanform, for the first time to go take pictures of it. Thousands of people were waiting to see pictures of it. It had turned out to be just a landform ,like NASA had said, not an ancient lifeform. Many people disagreed with the pictures that NASA took because they had stated that it was cloudy during the time they had taken the pictures on Mars so, they couldn't really get a clear shot of the face. While NASA agreed with them that it was a cloudy time of year on Mars they are still sure that there has never been life on the planet.

While NASA hasn't changed there opinion because it is in fact just a landform. Many people still want good proof that it could quite possibly be acient civilization. So, they prepared to send up another. This time they sent it up on a cloudless summer day so that no-one could argue that the weather affected the pictures. NASA was right again. This time they took up a camera that zoomed in the structure and it didn't show anything new that would have meant that there has ever been any life there.

All together, these facts prove that it is just a landform. A scientist named Garvin was quoted saying ""That's a lava dome that take the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The face is indeed just like a landform that we have here on Earth. Although the other side of this long running debate did have some evidence that might have made NASA think twice, there is still more proof that it is a landform.",4

Having a Facial Action Coding System inside of schools would benefit many schools and people. If schools had this and staff heard about a kid who is not looking mentally well they can have the kid go through the system and if anything is wrong they could give the kid the help he or she needs.

The child will not be able to slide past the system with a fake smile either because in paragraph 7 the FACS can detect the difference between a forced smile and a genuine smile making it harder for you to slip passed the system. The FACS does not always have to be used to see if a child feels bad and needs help. In paragraph 6 Dr. Haung says that if a child was on a computer the computer could recognize if the student was confused or bored. This could benefit kids greatly because sometimes kids are afraid to ask questions in front of the class, but if this was set up to where the teachers were alerted when a kid was confused the teacher could just walk over to the child and ask what they were confused about and asses the problem right where the kid is sitting.

In conclusion having the FACS in schools would benefit kids and teachers greatly because they could see how their students are feeling and if they are confused in anyway, and they could see what the problem is and how they could fix it whenever they need to.    ",2

If we want the earth to live as long as possible, if we want a safe enviroment for our children to live in the future, then we need change.

There is a settlement in Europe called Vauban, it is a car-free community, for the most part. There is only a couple streets in the entire community that are hospitable to cars. None of the houses except for a few have garages. 70 percent of the population does not own a car. It is a trending lifestyle in Europe, and i can see why. 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions are from cars in Europe. That number is raised to 50 percent in some parts of the United States.

In Paris, it was so smoggy that they had to ban the use of vehicles for an entire weekend, one day even license plates would be banned, the next day odd. If you were caught driving with a banned license plate you would be fined, and approximately 4,000 people were fined on that weekend, 27 people's cars were impounded. This was all part of an attempt to clear the 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter that was congesting the air. Compared to London with 79.7. Public transit however was free during this time, and hybrid cars, electric cars, and cars with 3 or more passengers were allowed.

In Bogota, Colombia, they celebrate ""Car-free day"", where everyone in the city leaves their cars at home and either hikes, bikes, skates, or takes the bus to work and school. Violators face a $25 fine. It all started back in the mid 1990s, the city has added 118 miles of bicycle paths since then, the most out of any latin city. Parks and sports centers have also made an appearance around the city.

Basically what im trying to get across here is that all cars do is make us get to work faster, but if you think about the cons, it pollutes our earth, it dirties our streets, it congests our cities, and it makes everyone unhappy. We need to change, not all of us, but some of us, for the children.    ",3
7f83b08,"The Electoral College, the real group of electors, is a process in which the public selctes the electors. These electors then cast there votes for the President and Vice President. In total there is 538 electors that participate in the process and  a majority of 270 votes as necessary to elct the President and the Vice President. These electors are chosen from each state, one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for you Senators. For the District of Columbia, since it's not a real state, it is awarded three electors due to the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution. The time to vote for electors is every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday. Some people disagree with this system, but the founding fathers of the U.S. had a reason for creating the Electoral College.

During a campain a candidate might have a lot of appeal in one area. For example a candidate might hae a lot appeal in the north where there is barely  any state that has more than eight electoral votes and confirm that the votes will go him. Those states with very low electoral vote count will not be enough to hit 270 total votes. This drives the candidate to spread his campain to other locations to get more votes, not only for that but because he has no reason to stay in those comfirmed states. So thismakes everyone across the nation feel that there votes do count.

The opinion that goes against the Electoral System claims that the system isn't democratic and dosen't let the people directly vote for there candidate. Or another claim is that the people don't know who the electers are or what there intentions are.

It is true that it's not democrtic or that the electors are not well known. But the electors that the people vote for are ususally picked out by the candidate or the candidates party, which are the people that you vote for. And by the time you got to vote for the electors they already are comfirmed of who they are going to vote for so that gives no reason to doubt it.                                                    ",3

571c3fa,"Dear State Senator,

Im just a regular voter arguing with you that I dont agree with the electoral college.

Perhaps If us citizens knew exactly what and who we vote for, we'd have a better undestanding of how votes are casted in the ballot other than us voting for the ""President"" but actually voting for the electors of the candidate who really ""vote"" for us. You've probably have heard of arguments over deteriorating the electoral collage, but if we dont actually vote for our president that we want to be our president then why have a set of electors vote for us when we are tryng to vote for ourselves?

The Electoral Collage is a process of voing for our President along with the Vice President and the electors. This process may be a little overwhelming for some people knowing that they dont actually vote for the wanted President directly, but is a well thoughtout process built by our founding fathes long ago. Maybe there was a reason for not allowing us to really vote for our President diectly instead of having the elecotrs vote for them along with Congress, or even it could have just been a big mess from the beginning that Congress and H.O.R and the Senate have been fixing. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors i n which only 270 of those votes count into electing a Pesident. The author, Bradford Plumer, of the article ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of he system are wrong"" tells us a little of how the system isnt what we really think it is. ""Under the electorla college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slae of electors, who in turn elect the president"" he asserts. An example Plumer gives us is that if you lived in Texas at the time of John Kerry, when he was running ofr pesident, you would have voted for a group of 34 Democratic electos who would then have voted for Kerry in retun to votin for his electors. A question is, who are these so-called electors? Electors are anyone who doesnt hold puplic office. Who picks the electors? Mostly depends on the state for that job. In that case, in choosuing your electors, they hold presidential conventions, a state party central committee, and even the presidential candidates themselves can pick who his electors are. Including the fact that voters cant always control whom their elctos vote for.

The single best argument against the electoral college is the disaste factor. A disaster factor can be in th form of a tie. If two candidates go into a tie, then the ""tie braker,"" as most people refer it as, it gets sent to the House of Representatives (H.O.R) where state delegations vote on the president; and the senate would choose the vice president. At the most basic level, he electoral college is unfair fo voters. The winner-take-all system in each state, makes it sort of easier fo candidates to get most votes. Which is what you would call the ""swing states."" During the 2,000 campaign, seventeen staes didnt see the candidates at all, including the state of Rhode Island and Sount Carolina and 25 of the biggest media marcketing companies didnt get to see not one ad from the campaign ads. Its pretty straight forward from here. The electoral college is an unfair system, outdated, and irrational. We basically only have assertions against it. Probably wont even be enough to say that the electoral college is unfair, but is enough to say just for the good of the people.

Knowing that citizens votes have no effect really towards the president, then people would be most likely to not wathc the campaigns during he election season of it all. Therefor, the electoral college, once again, is not a great way of electing our president.    ",4

Change the Electoral College,These citizens deserve to have their voices heard!  Many citizens are not aware of the main objective of the Electoral college, and thus tend to debate in order to change how a president gets elected or leave it untouched with no mistakes fixed. For example, in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" Bradford Plumer states that the Electoral College is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance in  winning. Bladford Plumer also stated that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. In my firm belief, I am in favor of changing the Electoral College, I'm sure of the consequences this will impact on society and history itself, but we need a system that grants equality with the citizens and the government. And the states that candidates are most likely willingly putting their vote on is on countries with significance.

-

However, not everyone has the same view. In"" In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" Richard A. Posner stated that the winner-take-all method of awarding the electoral votes induces the candidates- as we saw in 2012's election- to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. Posner also stated that the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that states by population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. Posner also said that the Electoral College avoids the problem in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. To back his claim, he states that Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 precent plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively).

-

Continuing, it is clear that the Electoral College does have it's advantages but also contains disadvantages as well. I'm fully aware of the consequences this may have upon the Constitution and the Senate. Now, I am not stating to get rid of the Electoral College itself, but try to adjust and fix some tideous and unfair treatments to make it all equal. Even though this could mean losing some interest from nominees, at least our system treats everyone with no difference. There are no superiors or inferiors in life.

-

In conclusion, I, not demand, but at least to try to have some concern for our population. Bad reputation may mean a high loss of income from other states, knowing that this country has done some very sinister deeds that are simply despicable. Listen to the complaints and hear their calling, after all, presidents always tend to drive their country to a better future, or am I wrong?    ",3

As a teenager i should be getting prepare to get my learner license but i do not bother because thats not my priority that doesn't mean i'm not interesting in driving but everything i need are close by like the mall , restaurants and a lot of other thing so i dont really see the need to be driving . By limiting our car usage we prevent accident and we payless bill such as car insurance and gas money .

""After a day of near-record pollution , Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city "". Every country should have more than one day where we are car-free because that will protect the air we breath by bringing the congestion down and also we will have less car accident. where everyone can take the bus or we can just walk to wherever we need to go. it would be a good opportunity to lower the cars accidents and the pollution .""All of our development since World War 2 has been centered on the car , and that will have to change "" we can centered that development on something better , on something that will be on our benefit and that will help us to move foward not that the cars doesn't help us but it also pollute the air we breath and we need the air more then we need the cars , might as well reduce the development of car to protect ourselves . ""In previous bills , 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport "".

buying a car and still have to pay all those extra money is a a pain and a waste money. Those money could got to your kids college funds or for vacations , putting yourself in a situation to have too much in your plate is not worth it ,why be always tense when we can be happier . That is too much money just on cars who will bring more trouble then anyone deserve . ""A study last year found hat driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 "" young people have found out its not that fun having to drive around . Most likely as soon as you can drive your parents leave all the responsibilities on you ,starting with the groceries then dropping your young sibling somewhere to others thing. There's also the gas money , the car accidents and if you take a light the tickets bills  and the money for when you taking the highway . People shouldn't have all those trouble coming with the car , thats why the percentage reduce because most people now just take the bus or walk .

Many times my aunt had complained about the problems that come with the car but she still use her car for simple reason such as going to walmart by the house when she could just walk there .The advantages of limiting our cars usages such as less accidents and a better air to breathe are way better then the disavantages which are polluted air , having to pay cars insurances with gas and otherso why not stick to what's better for our environment.

0a48500,"Have you ever heard of the facial action coding system? The facial actions coding system enables computers to identify human emotions. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all fourty four major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". Pretty cool,right? But is this technology really valuable for students in a classroom? I'm going to give you three reasons as to why i think this technology is not valueable.

Firstly, students have a right to keep their privacy. it might be very embarrasing for a student that wants to keep their emotions private to later find out that teachers know exactly how they feel. Even though by just looking at somebody you can whether someone is happy,sad,mad,and etc. If someone doesn't feel comfortable with their emotions they can seek the help they need. Students might not want to attend school anymore due to the fact that their privacy has been taken away, and at any second they might be questioned about their emotions.

secondally, students attend school to learn. By cutting precious timeout of their day to try and read their emotions many students will not get the learning that is needed. Students will start to get bad grades and fail many classes if they are not learning the right way. Many parents might get upset, because they might not want the their kids to go through this process. If the teachers have the parents permission that would be a whole different story.

Lastly, Many students already go through stress due to having many school assignments and trying to keep their grades in good shape. If teachers put another stress factor on kids it could be very hard on them, and also could lead to depression. This generation if very private with everything that goes on in their daily life activities. I know students will not like everyone knowing about how they all are feeling everyday. Students deserve to be happy or sad without everyone knowing.

This are my three reasons as to why i feel that the facial action coding system is not valueable to students in a classroom. They need privacy, not having many stress in their lifes, and lastly they need their learning time.",4
f8d6719,"Being able to detect other peoples and even your own feelings when you want to just by looking into a computer to detect whether you are happy,sad or angry is unique. But if you are not willing to share or show that information at a public place it would not be. Especially when your surrounded by your own classmates and one of classmates accidentally sees what the technology detects on you or someone else.

I personally think the use of this technology to determine what your mood is pointless in a classroom full of students. I mean what would be valuable about it? Besides detecting your mood. Students come to class just to learn, be creative and open their mind to knowledge. The Facial Action Coding System would be more of a distraction to kids they would not be worried about the right things.

Also some students would not take it seriously they would just play around when it comes to this just by making faces into the computer. And inviting their friends to come along and do it with them. Which would be a huge distraction to to both the students themselves and the students that are actually trying to learn. When it comes to stuff like this students would just use it as a toy and will not actually use it for what it is for or see the bigger picture for it. The authority would be very angry once students are playing with it and not paying attention.

The Facial Acting Coding System could possibly start some problems with students and their classmates. For example say their is a student sitting down in front of the technology and it detects the student is angry and sad. What if they are other classmates watching what it detects and ask the student ""Whats wrong why are angry?"". The other student would not want to tell him because it is probably something personal they would like to keep to themselves and not share with others. This will cause the other classmate to go around and tell everyone that the student was angry and sad. It might possibly cause chaos.

Therefore these examples show perfect evidence on why this technology should not be available in a classroom. It can cause a lot of problems, playing around and just an unecessary distraction to not one but many. And possibly it may not even be accurate in some cases.          ",4
91db757,"I don't think it would be worth the money to put in technology in a classroom to see what a student is feeling, because not everyone wants everyone knowing what they are feeling. What if that student just wants to be left alone? When I'm mad I don't want everyone knowing what's going on, I'd rather not talk to anyone unless I ask them for help about the situation. If they did put the technology in a classroom to tell what every child is feeling everyone would know each others business.

In the article it stated that it could help teachers know if the child is bored or confused, but does that child want the student to call him or her out on it? Probably not because if that student is struggling in class they don't want everyone knowing, if that student is struggling or confused then they need to ask the teacher at a seperate time if they don't want everyone to know how they struggle academically.

Not everyone is a emotional person they don't know how to share their feelings but they probably don't want some machine telling them how they feel and how they are feeling by how they look. Because anyone can fake a smile or a happy moment, but if that student doesn't know how to express themselves without a machine telling them, then they most likley don't want everyone else knowing what they're going through.

Technology has advanced majorly in just the past few years, but we are humans and we need to be able to show our emotions without a computer telling us how were feeling by how we look on that day. We all have bad days and we all have good days but on the bad day if that computer tells me I'm depressed then I could believe that and my mental state not be stable anymore because that computer told me I was depressed based on how I looked and felt one day.

We as humans need to learn how to express ourselves without using an emoji on our keyboards. Technology has made our lifes easier but again has changed too many things in todays world. ",3

The worthy persuit in thing in venus are that they are closest planet to the earth.The evidence is that it says that ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closest in distance too.""Another piece of evidence is that these is some differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars

and other times to Venus.

There are very many dangers in the challenge of exploring Venus.""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent caron dioxide blankets Venus.""""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to the sea level of the Earth."" Humans could be able to live on Venus.""Not easy conditions, but surviveable for humans.The might not be able to complete the challenge.""They are striving to meet the chellenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.""

9cb909d,"The author supports the idea of studying Venus because Venus was the first chose of Earth before they discovered Earth . Also it could've been life since their is so much water their so it can support people way of living . Plus the planet has valleys , mountains, and craters just like Earth does . Including they are making sure that it is safe for humans to travel there . Also their would be more of a different type of lifestyle on Venus so humans on Earth can discover a new enviorment and world .

Venus is a different life upon humans . Extremely so that the technology we have today can out beat the technology from the 1800s or the 1940s . The calculations of a moder computer are powerful for the people NASA it's helps prevent any physical conditions that can happen to the travlers . Also the distance wouldn't be so bad for the people on Earth . Plus NASA is discovering on how to start life their for people who wants to start over again and be in a better year around world they can .

The author also thinks that the risks aren't very harmful to humans . Including since the sun is so close to Venus he discovered that there would be more better warmer days than winter days . Venus could be the next Florida for people who love to be warm . The author also states that Venus is a beautiful planet from just studying the features of it so why wouldn't it be beautiful to live on .

Venus oxygen also is better there yes there maybe a few storms but you'll never have to rely on trees for saving your life .

Venus also is the nearest option for a visit because if anything happen to Earth where would people go ? Venus of course because at this point the NASA people would have knowledge to know that the other world we have would be the next best place for us .Including the value of Venus is great because the farms that can be planeted their would be healiter foods for people . The water in Venus is safe and is not deadly for the travelers . Also it would be more cheaper and a better government there in Venus .

In conclusion Venus has so many great values and amazing different way to look at life it's self . Have a different type of lifestyle when you wake up in the morning . Including waking up to that nice hot weather and very sunny out . Also seeing different animals . Plus just having a better view at life . ",3

Caring for these animals will keep you busy and sure that you are using your time wisely.

The animals would have to be groomed and brushed every day. They would have to be properly fed and taken care of.

Besides helping people you get the joy of traveling over sea, meeting new people, and cite seeing in foreign countries. For example you would maybe get to see or visit in Venice, Italy, or maybe even Greece. There are many different advantages and opporunities in this kind of trip.

78ec7f6,"There is a lot of technology being made to try to help human communication. Computers can read the emotions on the face of a human. Isn't that awesome !? This could help out with things that some humans dont want to say. Like depression or worriness ect. However some people still say that this technology will not be useful. I toatally disagree ! Think on the brighter side.

With this new technology it could be a little easier on the students. It could help the teachers know what type of mood the student is in. This would probably help by the teachers showing empathy to the students. Also this could stop conflicts with students. When two students are feeling angry you could remove them. I think this Technology is very valuable.

Also having a computer that know how your feeling at the moment would be such a big help. If it knows your feeling sad it could post ads to try to cheer you up. If your feeling happy it could play music to go with your spirit. When you are feeling confused about something , it could ask do you need help ? Also if you get bored with something it could make the next assignment different.

Evidence to support my claim that this technology is valuable is all through ""Making mona Lisa Smile"". "" Imagine a computer that knows when your happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."" ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr. Huang predicts.

9e12467,"After reading ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", driverless cars seem to sound theoretically pleasing, however in reality, are a bad idea and should not be continued to develop. These driverless cars have multiple, negative aspects that outweigh the positives, including a major precaution, saftey. They also take away from the driving experience, and add to the dependency on technology.

First of all, the article enters with ""Google cars aren't truly driverless."" This shows how driverless cars are not even at the level of functioning alone without the driver being alert, defeating the purpose of the ""driverless"" car since a human would always have to be present in case something went wrong. Something that manufactures attempted to do was to have ""smart-road systems"", but they ""required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" This proves that the costs for the modified roads would be too much to fit the driverless car's needs, so that idea for using the cars would not work. The articles says the cars need ""a whole lot of sensors."" Later, it describes the multiple sensors and states ""the combination of all this input is necesary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" This proves that the costs would probably increase due to the new technology as well as the variables that could go wrong increases as the amount of new sensors increase. All of the senors could not mimic the skill of the humans because everything can be constantly changing, from the condition of the roads to the weather. Others might argue, ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own,"" however, manufacturers are not at that point of high level saftey and can never guarentee one hundred percent safety. Furthermore, driverless cars can ""steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" This again describes how driverless cars will never be driverless. ""The human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" ""This necesitiates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs."" This illustrates how unsafe the driverless cars would be. Any mishap to a sensor or system control could result in terrible consequences. Since the cars would be using new technology, it would be unreliable, because technology tends to fail often. This failure could result in injury or even death, a risk that people should not take. In addition, not only are the cars unsafe, but they also prevent drivers from having fun while driving or getting the full experience. ""Some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays,"" which are more things that can distract the driver. This would create drivers that rely on technology, and if something went wrong, they would not know what to do. Later, the article informs readers that ""in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This is because most states know driverless cars are not safe. To account for these new cars, laws would have to change. ""If traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident,"" adding to the trouble of making these cars a possibility and possible conflicts that could arise. When asked in the articule, ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer,"" this question highlights the position that driverless cars should not be developed. When describing the production of these cars, manufacturers are all about technology. However, technology is bound to fail at times and can be flawed, especially in the beginning process. As techonolgy increases, risks are increased which can be applied to the cars, since more systems would be added. Instead of developing these cars, manufacturers should look to improving the cars produced currently, such as making them more eco-friendly. Cars already have some sensors that aid and assist the driver, but could not take the place of a real human at the wheel.

Overall, the development of driverless cars should not progress. Due to saftey factors, technology failure, costs, and possible liability issues, driverless cars should not be produced. There are too many risks that could go wrong due to a system malfunction. Humans should not need to be dependent on technology in order to drive. Driverless cars could not replace a human dealing with everyday, constantly changing driving conditions and unexpected events. The cars could attempt to mimic human skills, but would not meet them.",5

04030c7,"Although it does seem like looking back to the past is the right thing, sometimes changing the past can have good effects for the future. The founding fathers that established the United States Constitution also established the Electoral College. Even though it has been used for many years it is the not most accurate form of voting. The popular vote is much more accurate in which the citizens of the United States vote for who they want.

One of the many problems with the Electoral College system is that the citizens of that state don't vote for president. Instead they vote for electors which then vote for president. They vote for the electors that they think are trustworthy and are going to vote for the candadite they want to win. Sometimes voters get confused about the electors an end of voting for the wrong candidate. In addition there can be a tie in the Electoral College and in that case the election would be thown to the House of Reprsentatives where state delegations vote on the president.

Every state receives an amount of point decided by the population of that state. ""It is unfair for voters because of the winner takes all system."" (Source 2, Paragraph 13) If a state is won by only 3 votes the candidate that wins the state, takes all the points for that state. Therefore it is possible to win the Popular vote and lose the Electoral Vote. In that case the winner of the electoral vote would be pronounced president of the United States of America.

The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Each state has a favorable amount of democrats or republicans, therefore, candidates don't go to states or run ads in states they know the cannot win due to the state being to far into the enemy party. States that change from a democrat to a republican state and vice versa are called ""swing"" states. Those are states that the candidates running for president will want to visit and run ads in.

Electoral College has followed us since the Constitution was established, but it is time that we leave it behind and look to a new voting system. We need to abolish Electoral College because it is an unreliable way for to run the campaign for becoming the president of the United States of America.    ",3

First reason why I am against the development of this car is because of money. Some places there may not be enough money or room to even consider doing this project. Also, some people won`t do it because they want to drive, or feel comfortable driving their own car.

Second, it may cause many wrecks. The car itself may be fit and ready, but it may cause wrecks because of weather conditions or the car itself can`t control itself.

Within the classroom, various emotions can be felt by its students while learning new topics and receiving their education. Feelings can range from excitement and an interest in learning new subjects to being bored or unmotivated to proceed with the lesson. Day by day, technology is further and used more frequently within our schools, allowing us to adapt new education methods. Most students in the US are presented with an electronic device by their school to complete their homework and classwork on. The FACS could easily be intregrated into these devices, affecting how education could be taught and learned. If it was being used in a correct, effective manner, it could change how we teach our students forever!

Let's imagine that a student was perhaps puzzled and confused by a lesson being taught using technology. The FACS program could detect this, modifying the information to be more understandable and/or enjoyable to the student. This would allow for education to be more effective in many different ways. It could be very different for how two tenth graders in the same class learn new subjects and topics the most effectively. If this was released into schools, it is very possible and most likely that grades would improve drastically. This technology could also assist those with special needs or learning disabilities to teach them in the most effective, best technique for them.

While being present at school, not all emotions displayed by students are caused by learning. There might be unknown stresses or difficulties at home or personal lives, causing emotional and/or physical distress. This can majorly affect their grades and learning experience, but also their overall health in general. Using the FACS to detect certain emotions and patterns in students could help notify educators and administration of possible issues with various causes. This would allow the student to gain access to the aid and assist they need to be able to persevere and stride forward with success. The health of students need to come first before learning and using technology to discover if they need assistance would invaluable to the school systems.

Technology is always advancing and evolving into different, new forms. The FACS is just one of the many things that could change our education system and how we teach students. Overall, it would provide aid to students that need it to succeed in their education and have more of a understanding in subjects they were originally confused by. A major benefit to using this program would be detecting distress in students, allowing the school to assist them and receive the help they need to succeed. The FACS could change how schools work forever if they were used in our classrooms and it would be for the benefit of our students.",6
637ba77,"Recently, there has been an issue about a the so-called ""Face"" landform on Mars. People across the world are arguing that the Face was created by aliens. Scientists at NASA are arguing otherwise. I believe the Face was not created by aliens.

First of all, the scientists at NASA want the Face to be made by an alien civilization. The Face being made by an alien civilization would boost NASA's popularity, therefore boosting NASA's budget. With a higher budget, NASA would be able to explore more, possibly even explore the Face. If there was an alien civilization, NASA would have no reason to hide it. NASA would reveal it to the public and most likely do more research. Finding information about another civilization would be a good thing for NASA.

Next, pictures have been taken of the landform. On April 5, 1998, pictures were taken by Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team. The pictures showed a natural landform, not an alien-made monument, which is exactly what NASA scientists expected.

Most importantly, there are natural landforms just like the Face on Earth. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Jim Garvin, who is a cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" Quotes from this professional scientist show that a landform exactly like the Face could appear on Earth.

Although some people might say that the picture wasn't clear, scientists have cleared that up. On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor was close enough to take another picture. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution,"" says Garvin. The pixels in the picture from that day span 1.56 meters each, compared to 43 meters per pixil in the best 1976 Viking photo. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.

These reasons show that the Face on Mars was not created by aliens and is just a regular landform. The Face is just as likely to occur on Earth as it is on Mars. It is just a butte or mesa with unusual shadows that make it look like a face. I believe the Face was not created by aliens.   ",4
2e6c9d8,"Limiting car usage has great advantages wether you believe it or not. Sometimes you don't think about it but you really can do harm to yourselves by polluting the air with the gases that the car releases. There are many advantages to limiting car usage such as reducing smog,improving safety and it gets you active.

Smog can greatly affect people while they are driving. In Bogota, Colombia they have a program every year to reduce smog. Throughout the whole day people hiked,biked,skated,or took buses to get to their destination. It has been three straight years that cars have been banned in Colombia. The goal of this program is to promote alternative transportation and to reduce smog. The plan is so effective that even the rain won't stop the people from participating. This plan is set to spread to other countries. Beijing, China is one of the most polluted cities due to smog. Paris is said to have more smog than any other European capitals.

Although it may not seem like it but limiting your car usage can really improve safety. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisions. Everyone knows that transportation is the method of getting from point A to point B.The environment is what gives you oxygen to breath everyday. If the environment is polluted with smog it can cause danger to your health. If you just leave your car for a moment take a walk breath some fresh air you will feel better. There is 70 percent of Vauban families that do not own cars. Heidrun Walter is one of those persons that do not own a car and he says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way:"" People can live happily without cars. In the end your safety is improved because you could be saving yourself from a future health risk.

Indeed if you use a car everyday to get to your destinations you really are'nt doing anything that gets you active. Just how you have a car there are also other methods for you to get to your destinations. You can ride your bike,ride buses,or walk to your destinations too. In the mid 1990's the day without cars began in Bogota. If you really think about it cities could be built in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emmisions, and improve safety"". This helps you to at least take a walk everyday and it would also stop the pollution to the environment.

Limiting your car usage can have great advantages. Sometimes youprobably just didn't realize it but those advantages could really have an effect in the waqy you live. There are advantages such as reducing smog, improving your safety, and getting you active.                                    ",4
7ca104a,"The Electoral College is a way of deciding the President by having an amount of electors for each state. And the President that gets the most votes wins all [In most states] the electoral votes. Elecoral college is a great way to decide the President because having every one decide the President from popular votes is not fair because most people vote for what they hear from other people and if the others are voting for a President they are going to get more than one vote from one person. so having the Electoral College is the more fair way of deciding the votes.

People that are chosen are more cnoledgable and smarter to vote than people that vote just to say that they voted without looking and knowing why they voted for that President and not for the other. Because in the passage it says ""It is entierly possible that the winner of the electroal vote will not win the national popular votes"" and that suggests the point of this essay.

The Electoral College foucese more on all states than the popular votes. because big states like (Florida, texes, etc) have way more people than other states so if a state has 15 electoral votes and a diffrent state had 11 when the first state has double the amount of people in the second state. so that means that the President has to focuse on all the states so no state feels that their votes don't matter.

That is why the U.S should keep the Electeral College to decide the president because its a smarter and a better way to decide who is going to rule this country.    ",3

Well if that did'ent convinc you than, hears something that might, Luke Bomberger him self said ""He found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had beeen unloaded.""The Cowboys also played baseballand volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time."" Before all of that Luke and the crew took care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas. When Luke and his friend Don they were sent right to work. Luke was a little ahead of him self becaus he helped out his aunt Katie on her farm as a boy , but his chalang was the dangerous seas.

Now Luke was in his early 20s and he was on his second night of wachman job, that ment that Luke had to check the animals every hour. It was a rainy night ,he was making his hourly report to the captin. on his way down he sliped down aladder on his back. Luke shot feet first to an opening on one side of the boat but a small strip of metal stoped him from falling into the dark, cold,tarorizing Atlantic.

He had crackend a couple of his ribs. In Lukes life time Luke had made nine trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

That awareness stays with you forever like it did with Luke Bomberger. After you do this you can tell stundents and others about what you did to help others ,and you might even make an impact on others. For being in his 20ntys Luke was a smart young man for what he did.

52d0267,"I don't think that this system should be allowed in schools, mostly beacuse some people don't want other people to know how they are feeling. Maybe some people do. Even with this technology we don't know if that is the feeling is what the person is truly feeling.

We should maybe use this in criminal cases. The system would tell us if the defendent is getting scared and is lieing. If we could use this machine this was it would help get the bad people off the streets. Nobody should reject this idea, unless you are the bad guy around town. This system would help us in these cases.

Maybe some theipist would like to have this machine so they can quickly tell what their clients are feeling. I know that it can be hard reading other people's feeling, this would deffinantly take less time in showing the problem with the client. The less time that it would take to see how they are feeling, and the more time how they should feel.

Some places this would help, and maybe I dont see how this would help in schools. For most I dont think this should be here. No matter what I wouldn't use it. I rather have the face to face interactions with other humans and haveing them see how I feel. With the new technology coming out and learning how to read us could be bad. I'm not saying don't use it, but just be careful of how you use the technology.",3
e9b151f,"Driverless cars are some what useful for us because maybe elder people want to go out and they don't have anyone to take them. The teenagers may get bored of just sitting there and not drive, but the older people wont because they could relax. It could be useful either way, maybe some teens would like it because they enjured something, they wouldn't be able to drive now but they could if we had driverless cars. In the passage ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" they said something about putting something in the car to entertain them and making sure they keep their heads up at all times. Just because there is driverless cars coming soon doesn't mean that people can just drive them around whenever they feel like it, its same as being a car when you have control. You still have to watch out and go the speed limit, you can't take it and sleep when it's driving.

Over the past years cars have developed a lot. Now there are cars that you can turn on while you're still in the house, some cars have wifi, you can turn the heat on, and open doors before you get to the car. People want what is new so they can show something off but they don't show off the problems they could have with the car. Now they are making this new thing where a car can drive you around itself without you having to take control? Have they thought about the car accidents that could happen? Or how it could injure someone? This will take more responsibility than what a driver has now.

Would there have to be any test taking for those who want their permit or license? How do you know if they are capable of being in control over those things? Having the cars we have now are good enough. Those who want a driverless cars should still capable of doing the things they do now with a regular car. Senors will still be in the cars, if adding them to the new cars that would make it better for the person and the car.

They want to know who would be responsible for an accident? Well it would be the persons fault. If they aren't looking at the road because they were distracted by something else than that could be bad. They should be able to take control when they see something bad is about to happen.

Now if the driverless cars come with speaking instructions that could make things better because you can tell it what to do. If there is traffic and your vechile is going to fast you should be able to tell it to slow down.

Whether they're or no driverless cars people should always be safe while driving. They should always have their eyes on the road and be able to look to their right and left to make sure it is clear to move over. With this coming out people probably think it will be safer or dangerous. They should put things to entertain them so they can be focused on the road instead of their phones. People should still have to take the driving test with their control.",3
c7e56eb,"In a big city or a rual area all you see are cars flying past you at high speeds and releasing their gas fumes into the atmosphere. Having no cars is a great solution to having no traffic and less polution. Without cars our air would be fresh and it wouldnt take as long to get from place to place.

Although many people have cars and drive them regularly it is not always the best choice. Having no cars would be a drastic change to society but it would also be a major change in the way we travel and breathe in air. In Vauban, Germany the residents have gave up on cars. The streets are car free. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there"". This piece from the text tells us that hardly any one is driving a car their. One of the residents says ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way"" this lets us no that without a car the resident is much happier and is not tense. Car release greenhouse gas emissions from there tailpipes. In the article ""In German suburb, life goes on without cars"" it says that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"". That is insane to think that much is released, but its happening daily from everyday car users. The environmental agency is trying to promote car reduced communities. Polution got so bad in Paris that they had to enforce a partial driving ban. After enforcing this the texts says "" congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog"". So limiting their drving in Paris reduced the smog. It is not always the best choiceto drive all the time exspecially if you job or social event your going to isn't far. In ""The end of car culture"" it says "" organize your summer jobs and social life around where you can walk or take public  transportation or car-pool"". By doin those things it will reduced smog and gases getting into the air.

By not having any cars it would reduce polution, give us safer air to breathe, and it would be easier to get from place to place with any traffic. Cars release tons of gases and polute the air. WIthout cars it would reduce that problem. With less cars on the road and mostly public transportation it would be easy to get around instead of getting caught up in traffic. So not having cars wouldn't be such a bad thing after all.    ",3

I read all these articles about some states having to vote for the president's electors. They say basically when your voting for a president, your voting for his/hers electors. My opinion is there should be no need for electors. It should be easy and not too complicated. A presdient, a vice president, and a secatary. No electors or nothing. I think a president can do alot of his own work and think of ideas alone. If he need help than instead of us wasting our time with voting for people to give the presdient ideas and help him out. Well the President always say's God Bless America. Shouldn't the President be listening to the voices of his country. America. Yes, I think the candidate with the most votes should win. But, If they say that their going to do something for our country than they need to keep their word. Make it a better place not for himslef but for everyone. For instance, Barack Obama. What's the need for this unessarcy work that he has done. America is loosing their mind and doesnt know what's going on. Why is he doing this? The president is to make smart decent relevant choices. And if he listen to the voices of Americans than he would have lots of ideas lots! Instead he listens to who? His electors. People complain saying to themselfs, Where does he come up with these ideas? Well if you payed close attention to the presidents background and know what he really wants to do than you would know why. Honestly to me I dont think the Electoral College should keep going its just a bunch of mess that just doesnt make sence. Elelctors dont matter to most American's. Take the electors and the Electoral College away we dont want something we dont need. All we need is a President, a Vice Presdient, and a Secatary.

There are many pros and cons when relying on the driverless cars. There should always be an option between auto and manual. If somone gets in an accident, then is to be blamed. The driver can't take full responsibilty and neither can the manufacturers. But these cars may bring fear and harm to the community. For example, while in a driverless car, you may never know when the car will lose control, or stop working. These malfunctions may result in severe injuries or even death. Similar situations can occur in a manual car. But I'd rather rather have full responsibilty when it comes to situations like this. People's lives are improtant, so these things need to be taken in consideration. Last but not least, there numerous reasons why driverless cars will benefit the community. For example, a lot less fuel will be used, drivers will be more alert. Many people have been affected by driving and texting. But luckily, the driverless cars will prevent that from happening. If you lose control or get too close to another vehicle, this great technology will allow the car to steer you to safety.

6b6de98,"The ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform. There is no civilization on Mars. What made you think that there was a face on Mars was the shadows being casted on the landform. We have many of these landforms on Earth.

Nasa took the picture of the landform and wanted to attract attention to Mars. According to the story, Nasa unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illustion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.""

The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars, and it did. (Paragraph 3 and 4)

Nasa wanted to show that there was no face on Mars. Nasa took another shot of the face. They felt that is was important to taxpayers. On April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The image first appered on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform not an alien monument. (Paragraph 6 and 7)

Another fact is that we have many landforms like this in the United States. The story states that, on April 8, 2001 Mars Global Survetor drew close enough for a second look. What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin, "" That's a lava dome that takes the form of a isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" (Paragraph 10 and 12)

Many people took the Face on Mars too far. People made the ""Face on Mars"" in movies, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and it even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. Some people thought that Nasa was hiding evidence that there is life on Mars. Nasa would have wanted people to know if there was life on Mars, because Nasa's budget has been cut.

This is why the ""Face on Mars""

is only just a landform with shadows on it that makes it look like a face. People have just taken the situation a little too far. There still could be a chance that there is a life form on Mars, but for know we know that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a landform.",4
d2f90b5,"There is diffren't arguments about the Face spotted on Mars. Some believe it is an alien artifact, and some believe it is just rocks. I'm here to tell you it it just rocks. So, there is nothing to worry about. If you don't believe me, just keep reading... and you will soon learn it is just your imagination. But some people probably never will learn. Till then, just read this... Maybe I will change your mind if you really believe it is a face. Or maybe I won't. Let's see what you choose.

First, it just your eyes messing with you! Your eyes can play tricks on you and make you see things that are not really there. This is just rocks oddly placed and the rocks have shadows. That it all your seeing. If it were really a so called ""face"" on Mars, that would mean there would have to be life on Mars before. Have they proven life on Mars? They only found traces of water in the past. So, there could have been life on mars, but we haven't found anything besides this Face. Yes, if we found more ''faces'' we could consider it. But, we haven't, and there isnt enough evidence to support it.

Also, over the past 25 years... we've seen the Face everywhere in papers.

This could all be a scam, people are just trying to get people intrested in Mars more. There is always false advertisment in commercials, news articles, ect. This is just another one of those! We would have found something out in 25 years. And what do you know? Nothing. All there is, is a picture. They even took a picture a second time and still found nothing,said it was just a natural landform. So, there is NOTHING to worry about.

Say this is a alien artifact... Do you have anything else besides the Face that they've? Are aliens even REAL?? Nobody really knows because there is only skepitics. Let's be honest about this, it's NASA. There are very intelligent people there. I'm sure the best of the best. They wouldn't lie about some rocks would they? No... but people believe what they choose. People's eyes see what they want to see. Hear what they want to hear, no matter what the truth is. If you were to ask anyone about the face being an alien artifact or it just being a natural landform, not everyone would agree.

All of the rocks could have moved over time and made the Face. Honestly, your eyes are just playing tricks with you. They are showing you something that isnt there. It is only shadows. Nothing else. Is it odd it is shaped to look like a face? Of course yes. This is all like ''Big Foot'' people are just making up stories. And seeing a tree but they think it is Big Foot's shadow. Your going to soon grow out of it and come to your senses. That it is just a natural landform. Not a face or alien artifact. IF they actually find evidence... more then just some pictures. Actual proof... maybe, things will be differen't sure. Till then, just use your logic. Do you really think it is something more then rocks?

I hope I've at least made you consider that the face is a landform. If I didn't... well maybe no one will. But I know what I believe is true. IT IS JUST A LANDFORM. And until you give ME evidence to your side of the story. You can't change my mind either. Fair enough, right?

I rest my case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ",3
fb9a39b,"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). He has classified six basic emotions - happiness,suprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness each characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raise your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris(around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion). ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an efective human instructor."" The same technology can make computer -animatedfaces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. Muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.

We can stop it by riding bikes than riding cars. Banned driving  can also help the environment it can stop producing smog that damage the greenhouse gas. Reducing diesel fuel was another reason that can destroy the atmosphere. All of these factors can damage the world unless we do somthing about it.

Riding bikes can reduce smog in the world because instead on gasoline it runs on you. You can ride any where you want without polluting the air around you. Riding bikes depend on you because it does not need gasoline. Also it cost cheaper than a car it stop when you stop. Paris due to driving it was cover in smog the solution was to ban it. Which began hybrids and other types of transportation that does not relied on gasoline. You can also help the atmosphere by riding bicycle every day than drving also can you and your famiily some money than cars that produce hamful smog that can damage the atmosphere. Thanks to bikes more smaller shops were open then a big mall in the middle of the highway.

Banned driving can help atmosphere by stopping smog to be produce while driving. In Bogota they have ban driving for almost there years and the condition is much improving every year. The outcome was that large, gray clouds rain on Bogorta because of ban driving. Ban driving can lead good opportunity to take away stress and reduce air pollution. After banning driving people began to find other transportaion by buliding more roads for walking or biking

Reduce using diseal fuel contribute to dangerous smog covering the world. Diesel fuel was blame when the ""France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline""(Source 2) More than 67% are diesels cars that led to intense smog in France. Reduce disel using can reduce smog, France reduce congestion by 60% after there intense smog. Cold night and warm days cause warm air to be trap in the world. The solution was to drive hybrid cars and free transportation wiithout using disel fuel.

All these factors are still happing today and to stop is to ride bikes or drive hybrids, if not ban driving, also reduce the use of disel fuel can contribute of improve the Earth. It can take a long time before our world is cover in smog than it can be ever replaced. Also thanks to hand held electronics made it easy to commicate than driving to them.    ",2
cc6b0c8,"The author of ""The Challenege of Exploring Venus,"" reasons for exploring venus are the planet could be the one that most resembles earth and to further scientific research.

The author wants us to be aware if Venus is the closest planet we have to Earth, and I dont mean proximity, im talking about most alike. They believe that It once had green life on it, oceans, and a livable atmosphere. The text states,""Long ago,Venus was probably covered largely with ocens and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" The text also says,""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but surviable."" With those things in mind scientist feel it is a need to go see if it is like or if it was once like Earth.

Venus could also be used to just to further scientific studies. The text states"" More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a dstance."" The rock and gas samples and all the other things can be used to compare to rocks and gases here on Earth, see what is the same and what is different about them to get a better understanding of how alike or diiferent the two planets are.

To conclude, what the author wanted us to get from that article was that, the planet Venus could be very similar to Earth and that they could use it to futher scientific studies by studying the nature on the panet.",3
fe8d838,"In the United States we have been votng for president for many decades. But now there are protest against the process of electing a president. Many argue that the electoral college should be abolished and others feel that we should elect by popular vote. I strongly believe that we should change to popular vote because the electors could defy peoples will, they are unfair to voters, and people arent necessarily voting for their president.

To begin with, the electors have the power to defy peoples will. State legistlaters are responsible for picking electors and those electors can defy the will of people. ""Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their partys candidate and cast a deciding for whomever they please."" said Bradford Plumer .This is not right because the legislatures are picking electors that are using their powers for the worst.

Next,the electoral college is unfair to the voters. "" Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state,candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" said Plumer. For example , during the 2000 campaign only 17 states didnt see the candidatesat all, that includes Rhode Island and South Carolina. Electoral colleges are not being fair to the states and their voters.

Lastly, the election process should be changed to popular vote because voters are necessarily voting for the president. Most people think that when they go to vote for their president that their votes are what decides the final outcome, but thats not true!.Its the electoral college that decides that. Some people dont vote for that reason , because they dont think that their vote will change anything. And in the end it does not seem very fair that are votes count by very little.

In conclusion, the way we elect are president every four years should be changed. It should go based on popular vote not on electoral college because elector could defy people, they are unfair to voters , and people arent necessarily voting for their president. For all the reason people should be able to vote and they will know that their vote will be counted.         ",4
dbd5d3c,"""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Three reasons right there on why we should switch over to election by popular vote. Unfair, outdated, and irrational. Let's help you better understand;

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all-system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" stated in

What's wrong with the electoral college

(source 2). The electoral college is also unfair because there's always one person, in this case candidates, trying harder than the other person. Also stated in source 2

""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Which is completely unfair, foolish even.

Way past outdated, ""In 1968,"" decades ago. There is no reason as to why we still actually have this around, many people stopped voting, maybe not because of how old this act is, but definetly because we need a new way. Election by popular vote could be one of those new ways. This electoral college has to have an experation date on it someday.

Irrational. Irrational because it doesn't make sense, if you think about it, it's basically an easy way to get out of cheating, and no one likes cheaters. If we were to change the election by popular vote, think about how much more worth it would be, think about how there wouldn't be as many problems if people voted for the right candidate. What if they actually won? What about all the world changes?

It just makes more sense, it's more reasonable. There could be so many things different today if we changed the way election worked years ago. It's never too late, we still have time. Time to stop the unfair, outdated, and irrational ways. All's you need is a little motivation.    ",3
085092e,"The Face has many reasons that in may be from aliens, but there are also many reasons against it. How you choose your final answer will have to do with your world view. Your mind may change once you hear different information.

May 24, 2001 was when the Face was first spotted. There were no other other landforms or artifatcts spotted on this mission. This is the first problem. If there were aliens that previously inhabited the plant, why would there be no other evidence? The only factor making it appear to be an Egyptian Pharaoh was the shadows casted on the rest of the structure. Though Michael Malin was able to get closer,clearer pictures of the landform, it still did not give straight evidence that aliens exsisted. If the Face did prove that aliens did once walk Mars, why would they be Egyptian? Scientist can only compare the structure to what they know, which is not much. Since the Face is equal to a mesa or butte, how would that be possible? Mesas and buttes are not caused by man, but by erosion and natural processes. The Face was most likely formed by coincidence.

Though there is no exact explanation for the Face on Mars, it is still interesting. If you belived in aliens, you would believe in is an artifact left by ""Martians"". If you do not believe in aliens, you would simply believe it happened because of natural processes as if it were a mesa or butte. Without proper evidence, we are left to believe in whatever we would like.      ",2
430d4de,"Why does NASA consider the ""Face of Mars"" to be a natural landform? They claim that the ""face"" is the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa. There are multiple points of evidence that support this claim.

Firstly, NASA has traveled to the location multiple times, and photographed it extensively. In the passage, it is stated that NASA sent two different spacecraft to photograph the formation three different times. While Viking I's camera appears to capture a face-like structure, this is not the case. In the passage, it is said that to confirm that this was a natural occurence, NASA sent the Mars Global surveyor to capture another image. This image was much sharper, and appeared to favor the idea that the site was natural. Some people were not satisified due to a claimed ""haze"" that hid the structure during the cloudy, windy period on Mars. The Global Surveyor was sent back a second time, and this time, it captured clear, still images that are at the absolute maximum resolution. (About 1.5 meters per pixel.) This was more than enough to capture an image of any structures on the site, but none were found.

In addition, NASA has no reason to keep the public misinformed about the so-called ""alien face."" Quite the opposite actually, as NASA would benefit immensely from the funds that could be acquired using the publicity. If there was conclusive evidence supporting the claim the ""alien face"" was a monument constructed by ancient Martian civilizations and not just a natural formation on the planet, NASA would advertise the claim and it's evidence in an attempt to receive more funding.

On the other hand, I can see how some people could be fooled into believing that there was once a civilization on Mars. In the passage, NASA uses a caption that says the structure ""resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

However, now that NASA has investigated the site and taken multiple photos confirming the site as a rock formation, the structure should be regarded as a regular Martian mesa that posseses an uncanny resemblance to a human face.

In conclusion, the ""Face of Mars"" has been proven to be little more than a large rock formation that simply bore an unnatural resemblance to a human face. The belief that it is otherwise a structure of ancient alien origin is unsubstantiated and incorrect.",4
d137d89,"Some people believe that the figure on mars is an alien face. Others believe it is just a huge rock formation which resembles a human head. The eyes, nose, and mouth are formed from shadows which resemble this illusion.

I believe that this so called ""alien monument"" is just a landform created by debris and rocks. The eyes, mouth, and nose are shadows of the rocks. It's completely obvious. Sure there might be other living organisms out in the universe and different species but there is also severe sand storms on mars. Which can throw rocks, make formations on the ground, and bury certain things. These reasons support my claim. The storms would throw random rocks into random places creating what at first may look like a face but once you get closer you see that it is, in fact, rocks. When rocks are placed together for a long period of time, especially in mars, they start binding together.

I see no other explanation of how this figure was created and I am very confident in my claim.",2
ec3e3ad,"""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" is an artical about how Venus is a close neighbor yet incredibly hard to study up close. The author suggest that is is worth the risk needed to study Venus and he had some compeling arguments. after reading this ask yourself would you take the risk?

Venus is a very extrem environment, with temetures that can melt tin. it is so extream that no space craft had survied more than a few hours on the surface of Venus. The planet had an atmospher of mostly carbon deoxide and is rittles with cloudes of sulfur. Despite all of that the author still belivews we should continue to explore Venus.

on of the authors key pointts was ""...once have been the most earth-like planet inour solar system."" The auter went on to say ""Venus was probably coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth.""

I belive this is a great reason to explore Venus more deeply, because if it has any truth to it why is the planet so deadly now? we should lookinto its past and make an understanding of what happend to Venus so we know what could happen to us and possibly even try and prevent it.

The author concluded thier artical by saying ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also,because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" i belive this is the authors main point, not just that we should know more about the planet but that it keeps us sharp and provieds problems to slove. The human mind is curious and will alway want to ""know how it works"" or ""whys it do that"" and if we dont presue those questions then we are learning nothing.

So in conclusion althoghVenus is an extream environment we should explore it more deeply. We should try to find ways to do so. the author gave many points but his best one was simply that the peopel are curious and want to know so show us.      ",3
8ff6bc7,"If driverless cars use less gas, polute less, and do not crash, I'm sure everyone would love to have them. The problem is that they might crash. Companies may state that their car will not crash, but people are reluctant to believe them.

If a car is 90% comupter driven, the only thing it is saving is stress the driver might build up while driving. The driver still has to be aware if their surroundings and still might have to take control. If the car was 100% coputer driven, I think more people would want one. If it was only computer driven, people could be more productive in the car. They could maybe get some work done or make important phone calls. Human error is always possible, but so is computer error. If money wasn't a factor, we'd already have smarter cars or smarter roads.

The only people who will want to be able to drive their car are people who don't trust the car, or peopole who want to speed and drift. If the cars were computer driven, they probably would go over the speed limit, unless a little computer error happens. If a computer driven car crashes, people will lean further away form the idea.

bba28a5,"Car-free Cities

In Germany there is a city called VAUBAN and the citizens in that city have been told not to use their cars. There is a law that forbids the citizens to have a car or to use one. If you have a car then you have to put it in a large parking garage which costs 40,000 dollars. So 70% of residents dont have a car and 57% sold their car in oreder to move there. There are also other cities/countries like Paris, Bogota, and the United Stated of America who want to be car-free.

Paris is being polluted by cars which is making the air fog up. So in order to regain control of the air, they have to ban cars temporarily. On mondays cars with even numbered license plates were commanded to to leave their cars at their house or get a 31 dollar fine. The uneven numbered license plates would get the same fee the next day. 4,000 people were fined for driving on the wrong day. Since the banning of the cars, Paris was down 60% of smog/fog.

A program in Bogota,Columbia insists that the citizens be car-free. It has been three years since they have banned cars with only public transportation allowed. It has reduced smog severly and has increased finances in local shops and sports stores. Being car-free has created more oppurtunities for the government and the city.

The United States is getting more polluted every year. the use of cars have been decreasing in use because eberyone is using public transportation in order to get to one point to the other. Teenagers have stopped getting their drivers license right when they turn 16. They usually dont make it the number 1 thing to do on their to-do list. Gas prices have also been getting higher so people are using their cars less frequently becuase of not having enough money.

Being car-free has its advantages and its disadvantages. Less pollution equals a better life for everyone and everything.  People need the exercise and the movement of the body to get to one place or another. But it takes a longer to time to get from point A to point B. Using a car makes things easier and faster but hurts the environment. So being car-free is the best way to go.    ",3

Scientists believe that Venus is alike to earth. It has about the same density and size compared to earth. In the article it states in paragraph 4 that ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported varius forms of life, just like Earth."" This quote helps state that it is a interesting planet and alike Earth they want to study and learn about it knowing the conditons.

Another example of how Venus is an interesting planet is because of the atmosphere and the ground conditions it has. Astronomers believe humans could survive there, however it wouldn't be easy with the conditions it has. A beam of light can barely pass throught the atmosphere; this causes the standard cameras to be ineffective.

In conclusion, Venus is a very interesting planet and despite the dangers it has, it is worth it to study. It will be harder to study knowing that you can't take anything from the planet back, or the fact that in order to do anything you need to actually be there on the planet to get a better understanding.

It seems like a great and wonderful device to have in work places and school places! I think we/they should have these devices in places that best need them! Like in and out the classroom.

I think its valuable because when your in a classroom teachers tend to ususally do a lesson even though all the students get bored out of their minds and end up not paying atention!! Same goes for doing a lesson on this computer, the classroom would be able to recognize the students emotions if the school had some of thses devices, but right now we don't because not all schools cant afford new high tech computers to recognize the childrens emotions! In the text it states

""A classroom computer could recognize when a studenr. Hat is becoming cinfused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure! With this it would probably take a while but easy t the same time, because there are so much combinations to this peice of technology! In the text it staes ""he facial expressions for each emotion are univeral,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (Like not smiling as broadly). This tells that there are so many emotions to decode! Now how this works is the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of your face and detects all your muscles in your face to determine what emotion your in. In the text so far states that Eckman has classifed 6 basic emotions and they are; happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

Overall, this mechine would be most useful in classrooms because teachers and computer programs can change up so that the students would not be so bored and not pay attention! So they correct their lessons and can make it entertaining and fun for everyone!",3

Now I would now what i whould do with out my car but then again there are some berifits or advantages you would have if you didnt own a car.

We  can start off on now much money you would save if you did have a car. Think about gas is about what $2.99 now right? Or lets just say your driving minding your own bessnious and some edeit rams in the back of your new Nisson 2015 car and oh lord i dont think you want to talk about how high you insurents would go up. People in Vaudan and in most of France don't even have cars 70 percent to be exact. Now its not like a law that they can't have veicals just alot of people choose not to have one. How ever if you do own a car you will have pertty much no where to put it. Street parking,driveways and home garages are actally forbidden in some areas. If you still really really want your car you have only two places to put it. One in a large parking garage at the edge of the development or two you can buy a space for $40,000 along with a home. If you never had a car you wouldn't have to spend all that money on gas,insurents,getting your car repaired/fixed,and a parking spot. That's why 57 percent of people sold there car when they moved to Vauba.

The biggest advantage you would have if you didnt own a car is that you will be giving back to mother earth. Cars are responsible for 12 perect of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. Cars can also be more stress then there worth having.

Getting in a car crash and seriousaly injuring yourself or worse die on inpacked right? Why don't you save the stress and the fear. Just give up you car. I know what your think what if i work far away etc? Just take the bus or better yet ride a bike to where ever you need to go or walk get some exercise and brake a little sweat. Or just take one day that we all not us own cars to just see how life would be. That's how BOGOTA got started in Colombia. They have been going it for 3 straight years. There are 7 million cizins people walked,hiked,and even skated. The only vehicals that where permitted where buses and taxis and if it rained it didn't stop them participating. Why can't we do that just for one day? If everyone just took one day that using cars I think i would make a big change.

There are many advantages we all would have if we all didn't have a car but I know it will take time for all of us to make that disitoin but hopful its soom before its to late for us and for the world.    ",4
6fb873a,"Why did people think that there was aliens on Mars. There was a face on mars,

They think it was made by aliens, and was it aliens or just landforms.

There was a face on mars. NASA's took some photos of the face. A lot of people seem to think that it is aliens that made look like face. People knew there most be others living on mars.

Poeple think it made by made by aliens. Other knew that it was made by the first humens and to think it look like Egyptian Phareoh. Why was it there and want to know who put there and how did it get there. So did people think is was aliens or humens.

Was it aliens or just landforms. To find out that it was just landforms some people want it aliens or first humens. Some what knew what is look like them was (middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho). Other knew that was landforms.

What I think what it is a buch of rocks that stay there for a longtime . Here are my reason. There was a face on mars, They think it was made by aliens, and was it aliens or just landforms.",2

Thus, causing a decrease in the amount of stress one inhabits, as well as a decrease in pollution, and beneficial effects on carbon emissions. The advantages of limiting car usage are increasing daily, and cutting your time spent driving may have a positive effect on not only your life but your families, and those surrounded by you.

Traveling across the world to Germany, you will find Vauban. A well-known, upscale community where more and more soccer moms and commuting executives are giving up their cars. This experimental, new district has generally forebidden street parking, driveways, and home garages. Therefore seventy percent of the residents in this community do not have cars, and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move to this ecofriendly habitat. One resident, Heidrun Walter says, ""When I had a car, I was always tense, I'm much happier now."" The atomosphere of this residence has a positive effect on stress, meaning it decreases it! The vibe of walking down a street filled with the swish of bicycles passing by, and the chatter of wandering children has lowered the stress of nearly all residents. This ecofriendly, and stress-free enviroment is a trend that is growing and being adopted by many countries, including the U.S. From Chicago to Shanghai, this residential area may be the place for you.

Paris, France, home to the famous Eiffel Tower even has its pollution problems. After days of uncontrollable smog, the ruling French party enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of thiis well-known city. They ruled that on Monday's even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their vehicles at home, and on Tuesdays, odd-numbered license plates were to do so as well. After this first trial, the congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France. This was a huge success since Paris typically has more pollution that other European capitals. Temporary laws like this have a huge effect on reducing the amount of pollution in crowded cities. Even the city of love has unclean air, how romantic is that? Limiting the usage of cars benefited this society immensely, and it could benefit our world as a whole if all of us chose to cut back our car usage at least twice a week.

Automobiles are the Beyonce of suburbs, where families from California all the way to Sydney tend to make their homes. Experts have concluded that this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes all around the world. Passenger cars in Europe are only responsible for twelve percent of these emissions, while America is responsible for up to fifty percent. President Obama's goals to drastically curb these greenhouse gas emissions will be assisted by a shift in American behavior: Fewer Americans getting their license. Studies have shown less and less of Americas youth are prioritizing getting their license. If this pattern persists, it will have a beneficial effect on the reduction of carbon emissions being released into the environment. This calls for less pollution, and a more ecofriendly, healthy society for us all.

In conclusion, limiting car usage in your daily life can cause a drastic change. These changes include a decrease in the amount of stress one inhabits, to less pollution, and a beneficial effect on carbon emissions. Our society as a whole has the opportunity to reduce car usage, so why not grab it while we have the chance. A healthier environment calls for a healthier you.         ",4
5bf836e,"The nasa is woirking on other approaches to studyng venus, for example some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venu's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

A thick atmostphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venu's atmostphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmostpheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

This is a challenge about Explring Venus. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of destiny and size, and occasionally the closestin distance to.

9af7507,"When we vote for our next president, do you have a voice? When you vote, you pick an ""ellectoral college"" to do the real vote. Our founding fathers decided to establish it, It's a weird system to follow though. No matter who has the popular vote, over fifty percent of the votes, will not win because of this system. I believe the people should truely decide on who becomes president, not a system.

When we vote, were just picking someone to vote for us again. If thats true then whats the point of voting? Over 60 percent of voters now would perfer a direct election because the ones who get over fifty percent of the ""peoples"" votes seem to lose just because of this system. John F. Kennedy won from a popular vote but if the electoral system was applied then, if that happend all the great things he did would be gone. The electoral college is outdated and irrational and needs to be changed.

Even if we argue about the system it'll probably never change, the unfairness. Lots of people decide not to vote because of this. People are realizing that votes aren't what they seem they are anymore, people in California and Texas stopped voting because they believed their vote had no effect which is close to the truth. More and more people are not voting, the main reason is this system.

If you think the electoral college is fair, think again. People might say ""oh, it's made because people who vote aren't educated enough to decide"". Are they calling the voters stupid? The only people who care to vote are the ones who mosy liekly did the research on the person before voting to make sure that person is making the right decision for our future. Oh, wait votes won't matter because the electoral college is doing it for us. The people's votes are just fake ones and dont really matter so why vote?

Does the popular vote matter? Why do we still vote? The electoral college does all the work, no matter what we do. We could have over half the votes on one president and have the other one win instead. The system we have to vote is flawed and should be removed so ""we the people"" can decide who to be president. We should decide on who leads out country to success.                                            ",3

e9d79df,"Think back to the day you got your license. The thrill of being able to drive and knowing how much more independce you would have. You want your kids to enjoy that experience too, right? Well what if that all went away because of driverless cars. I am against driverless cars because, driving helps you learn responsibility, the technology could fail or malfunction, and liablity arguments would arise.

When teens learn to drive they are given the rules and regualations. Remembering these rules and following them is their responsibility. With driverless cars the drivers or people in the drivers seat would have less responsibilty because they do not have to do as much work. In the article it says that the driverless cars can steer, accelerate, and break themselves. Since the driver has to do less they may not always pay attention becuase they would think it is the cars job to handle the driving. Carless drivers would make people more lacidazicle about driving. Driving teaches people to be responsible, without this how will we instill responsiblity into the people on our roads?

In todays society new technologies come out everyday. However, we know how frusterating technology can be if it doesn't work. If our Iphone or laptop glitches it usually isn't a big deal. It can be fixed in an instant, maybe even by yourself. But what could the consequences be if a driverless car glitches? While you are driving you don't really have a minute to google how to fix your car like you can do with an Ipad. Just like any new technology a driverless car could have malfunctions, but these malfunctions could but peoples lifes at risks. People may say that even today with people driving cars that there can be glitches in cars. However, since real people are driving the cars they can evaluate the situation and control the car.

If the driverless car does fail whose fault is it? The ""driver"" or the manufacturer? This question will definetly come up if driverless cars come into our society. If you get in a crash, but weren't in control of the car, how can you be blamed? This problem could to lead to new laws, many court cases, and law suits.

Driving is a right of passage for teens today. Driverless cars, while could make life easier, would just bring more problems and arguments into our already technology filled lives. Driverless cars should not be legal because driving teaches responsibilty, the technology could fail, and cause arguments over liability.        ",5

Venus is a planet from our solar system is simple to see from the distant, exploring venus is a challenge because present dangers. Numerous factors contribute to Venus' s reputation. More challeging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphera; NASA is working to studying Venus.

First, ""Venus, sometimes called the "" Evening Star, is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot"" because is simple to see from the distant.

Third, "" Even more challenging are the couds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's athmosphere"" because their conditions are extreme to humans on Earth. High pressure, geology and weather present additional impediments to see:

d58a5f4,"According to the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" in the near future there will be cars that don't need to be driven by people, but will be engineered to drive themselves. Evidence from the article shows, there are both positives and negatives to these cars being released and used by the public people. My opinion is that the development of these cars should stop, and that they will overall have a negative impact on the public and cause much more trouble than they are worth.

The first major concern of mine is the legalality of these cars. The article states that computer-driven cars are illegal to test in most states, so a person definitely couldn't ride in one in public. Only the states of California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia, are allowed even limited use of semi-autonomous cars.

In order for these cars to even be released to the public, many states would have to change their laws and it would take a long period of time just to do that. There is also cameras placed in some of the driverless cars, and to me, that is complete invasion of privacy. I believe a person should be able to do whatever they want in their own car without having to worry about being watched.

Another down-side to computer-driven cars is liability issues if a car were to get into an accident. Would the driver be the one to blame, or would it be the manufacturer of the car? There is no man-made object that is fool-proof, so why would computer-driven cars be any different? These are only some of the questions that people will face if companies do release driverless cars to the public.

I am a firm believer than machines operated by people work much more efficiently than machines that operate themselves. I believe that cars are something that are meant to be driven by people, and if they try to operate themselves, many accidents and machine malfunctions will occur. There is already many malfunctions that occur in modern cars as it is. Also driving is meant to be an awesome experience for people new to driving, and if driver-less cars are developed future generations will be robbed of their chance to experience what driving is really like.

My opinion is that the development of these cars should stop for multiple reasons, and that they will overall have a negative impact on the public and cause much more trouble than they are worth. The development of these cars should stop, because a great amount of money and time is being put into something that I believe will negatively impact the public. The issues stated above are only some of the issues that people will have to face if driverless cars are released to the public, think of how many more issues could possibly arise from computer-driven cars being released to the public.",4

c60eda0,"The facial action coding system for emotions was developed to detect different emotions. It may seem creepy to know everyones emptions but it can benefit teachers. It can even help out people in general to identify different emotions on people. The technology should be used to read students expressions. The technology should be used in school for its uniqueness, lessons, and overall connection to students and teachers.

With the system, teachers can detect truthfullness in their students. It can help connection with students and their teachers, or even just peers. People can force different faces to convince others to think they are different that how they actually feel. But, with the system you can tell when someone is genuine about a emotion. For example, there are certain muscles that move when someone is truly happy. The muscular units move around, the muscles at the cheek bones lift, and the crow feet around your eyes move.

The system itsself is highly intelligent, and completely new to our generation. The technology is advanced and had never been created before. The sytem can calculate the percentages of different emotions on people. There are a variety of emotions that it detects such as happiness, surprise, anger, disguist, fear, and sadness. It can even be used for ads to see if someone is interested in a certain thing. If they remain happy, they will show similar ads.

The coding sytem can be used by teachers for lessons. Students can appear bored and not interested in class. With the sytem, teachers know when they are into and engaged into their learning in the class. The system would detect the facial muscles to recognize them as uninterested. Then, they can adjust the lesson to engage more students and improve their learning overall.

In conclusion, teachers and schools should utilize this system and work it into their lessons. It has tons of benefits to learning. It is something new and advanced to the society. Also, it can be used to get more students invloved in learning, and ensure excited engaged students. Overall, the coding system can help with lessons, connection, and its uniqueness to society.

15479c1,"Dear State Senator,

I favor on changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. It is time for change to our voting system. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. five reasons for retaining the electoral college is, the certainty of the outcome, anyones president, swing states, huge states, and avoidment of run-off elections. The first reason is, in  2012's election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vot when romney only got 51.3 percent. the peoples popular vote wanted romney to win. I beleive it isnt fair that the electoral vote has the final say, there is more of the U.S citizens than the electoral college. The second reason is, the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trnasreginal appeal. residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised- to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isnt thir president. The third reason is, swing states. voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign, so the most thoughtful voters should be the ones who decides the election. The fourth reason is big states get more attention from from presidential candidates in a campaign than a smaller state which isnt fair or equal. the electoral college favorites of of bigger states. the fifth and last reason is that the electoral college avoids the problemof elections. The electoral college method of selecting the president, may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying there state. voters in the U.S presidential election are people who are exspressing a political preferance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

86d2b68,"The author did a very good job presenting his point of why we should be trying to study Venus. He gave valid points and tried to captivate the reader with interesting facts like "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. As a reader, things like that get my brain turing and I really start to think about it. I start to ask myself questions like 'If Venus was once like Earth, what happend to this planet to make it so inhospitable now?' and 'If we've never been able to get any kind of sample from Venus, what could be on that planet?'. When an author gets a reader to think more deeply about the essay, it means he's doing a pretty good job about explaning his thoughts and desires.

""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" can be found in the last paragraph of the essay. In this statement the author is saying that this isn't just about studing Venus. He's saying that it would be very interesting to actually see what's happening on Venus or even what Venus has come to now, but that if we, as humans, keep problem solving and coming up with new, successful ideas it could very well help us in the future with other things that we are trying to get a better understanding of. The problems of Venus that are holding us back are as follows; the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid, the planet's surface averages around 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atomosheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. The author is saying that getting past those obstacles would be evolutionary for humans.

Not only did the author give an excellent argument on why we shoundn't give up on Venus, he aslo brought up the idea that if we solve these problems, we ourselves will be able to evolve and solve other harder and more complex problems.

The main objective of this article wants to point out that it is trying to studie the planet Venus because of its close resimblence to earth except for tempertures but the density and mass of it.

This article really does have a good point to it considering on how much time and studies go into this planet. one of their plans is to fray above the atmosphere just enough so that they are able to withstand most of the harsh conditions to last a good amount of time. They even tested it in a similar enviroment that they made acustomed to the same enviroment as venus has and it lasted 3 weeks at the most. But their are other things that they are thinking of doing such as they are thinking of using old technology that was presented around the 1940's just because ""these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do note require electronics at all."" the point that they are trying to make is that mechanical stuff is more durable and modern technology. You see modern technology is flexible, powerful, and quick but mechanical gears are more capable of withstanding the extreme pressure and heat that venus can throw at them.

This planet is very old and it is to say that it once held a hospitable enviroment with oceans and trees and life as we now it. But as you can see, now it isn't doing very well so that is why we want to studie it because of its mysterious past.

aa22161,"The face of Mars is a landform in the region of Mars called Cydonia. Because of limited photographic resolution at the time, the Viking 1 photo from 1976 makes it look like a face. Some people say that the face was made by aliens, but there is scientific evidence against this.

The reason it looks like a face is because the 1976 photograph was blurred. A later photo taken in 1998 makes it look less like a face, but some claimed it may still be a face due to the fact that the photo was taken in cloudy weather. In 2001, a photo was taken that did not look like a face at all, but a natural landform such as a butte or mesa. It is unlikely that aliens would make a landform like this, because it has no actual structure. Statues and monuments made by humans are meant to look like something and tend to be uniform in shape. The Face on Mars, in more recent photographs, doesn't look like anything but what it probably is, which is a natural landform.

Another reason it is probably a natural landform is because theories that it was made by aliens were created purely by the public. There is no actual evidence that would suggest that the the face on Mars was made by anything that was alive, other than the fact that a blurry photograph taken 40 years ago makes it look like a face. There is not any evidence to suggest that Mars would have even been able to support life in the past or is able to support it now.

The evidence against the Face on Mars being made by aliens or an ancient civilization on Mars is far too substantial to be dismissed in favor of speculation by conspiracy theorists or depictions of it in fictional movies. In fact, the face on Mars strongly resembles landforms on Earth that were formed naturally. The most likely explanation for the face is that it's a natural formation that looked like a face in a photograph, and that anything special about it is purely speculated. It is completely illogical to think that an optical illusion means anything, and until there is evidence to suggest that it isn't, the Face on Mars is probably nothing more than a hill.",4
1e7551f,"Do you know how smart a computer is, or how efficient it is compared to the human brain? You cant even compare the two, its just not an even fight. Now when you put it into perspective, human error has made car crashes one of the leading cause of death today. So I'm in firm belief that ""driverless cars"" is not only safer, more effiecient but would be the future to cars.

First not only has a computer controlled car never taken a life, but it has never crashed. Now the word ""never"" is a bold word since not everything is certain, but the calculation and sensors of a computer controlled car has made the ""driveless car""

never crash since its debut in 2009 as said in paragraph 2 ""Google had cars that could drive indepnedently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million of miles without a crash,.."" How fast do you think is your reaction time? And do you do well against pressure? Well if you are driving, countless situation like these would soon come your way. Now if you were a computer, your reaction time is a blur and you have no pressure to worry about. As stated in paragraph 5 "" .. those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out -of-control skids or

rollovers."" In those situation, people would just brace themselves and pray for low medial bills after the accident. Now if the driverless car drove, these things can be avoided endlessly.

Second, driverless cars are more efficient. Theres just no other way to put it. As stated in paragraph 1 ""...would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" You ask where is the logic to that? Well, humans tend to speed up and slam their brakes constantly while driving. But with a driverless car, all they would need is calculation. Imagine a world where there are just full of driverless cars. If they are all controlled by computer and have the same calculations, most traffic jams would be resolved. . Not only would there be no hassle but it would be safer, and much more convienient for everyone.

Last, it had stated in paragraph 8 the following: ""The psychological aspects of automatin are are really a challenge,"" ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" What that means is if and only if this driverless car is perfected, and it would need support, not only would you be able to watch your favorite show on the way to work, but it would revolutionize the way we spend our time. Since due to constant driving, and traffic, we spend so much time on the wheel. If we take that out, we would have countless hours

of free time!

In conclusion, I think driverless cars are having a bad name since it is not fully ""driverless."" But there is no doubt is it SO much safer. As the cofounder of on the most influential company ""Google"" Sergey Brin stated in paragraph 1 ""He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world""

The fun part is that you get to do all the things that you might of what'd to do like visiting a lot of unique places.

So we are going to enter view a person his name is Luke bomberger he crossed the Alantic ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War Il. But before all of this happened he did not know what he was going to do with he life he had 2 jobs and one of the jobs he .worked with he's friend. He's friend invited him to go Europe on a cattle boat. Luke he couldn't say no because he knew ' it was only in a lifetime thing'.

But if your not a rise taker you probly should not take this job because luke he broke his ribs and he couldn't work for almost a month. And he almost slid off the boat and if you didn't know he could of died how crazy is that. But not only that but you have to be resonspable because Luke had to care for him self and for the animals and had to change there cattle. But if I think about that I could not even do that job Icant even barely take care of my cat and puppy at home . Not only that Luke's animals were not the size of a kitten or a puppy they were cows, horses , and prolly even goats.

But if you really want this job you have to be all this 6 things 1. Caring 2. resonsable 3. reliebole 4. heping 5. Rise taker 6. *You have to know what challenge you are going to be up to*     ",2
90b0f95,"Dear State Senator,

Have you ever sent your vote to where its is in the hands of other people not knowing what is going to happen to it like is it going to be counted for the person you want it to, or it could be for the person you really do not want to win. Well that is called an electoral college. It in my opinion is not a very good system because, you don't always get to vote for who you want to.

I believe that we as individuals have the right to choose what we want in a leader. I do not believe Electoral College. For the simple fact, we do not always get to vote for who we want to run our country. The people of America have their own beliefs and own opinion and when it comes down to where we have to choose the person who will be running our country for four consecutive years we will vote for the one we believe that will not hurt our beautiful country. But if we did choose the Electoral College and I wanted to vote for John McCain for instance, and is sent it in and now your vote is in the hands of other people now you don't know if your vote is gonna be for John McCain or Barak Obama. Therefore I do not like or consider anyone using the Electoral Collage.

By using the popular vote you are guaranteed the vote you wanted. You don't have to worry if you vote got changed or not. You popular vote is what you wanted to choose and no one could change that

So I think I speak for the people when I say lets do away with the Electoral College and just use the popular votes.

-Thank You

6a18fc8,"""The Seagoing Cowboys program is an adventure,"" stated Luke. We go all over the place, for example we have been to China and Greece. The Seagoing Cowboys program made me more aware of people's needs in other countries. When we had nothing to do we would waste time by playing games in empty holds where animals had been housed.

When I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program we helped baby cows, mules, and horses that were shipped overseas. We arrived August 14 when the Pacific war ended. Don and I headed for Greece with horses and hay and oats to feed them.

You should be apart of the program because it is fun to go on adventures and take care of the animals. Even if you don't like animals you get to have freetime and play games and visit places like China. When you unload the animals you can play tennis, boxing, reading, and whittiling. The program opened up the world for me.

When I took care of the animals they had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Also you had to pull up bales of hay and bags of oats. Next then you had to clean the stalls out. When I worked at a farm for my aunt Katie, it prepared me for the Seagoing Cowboys program. I was greatful for the opportuniy to help the program.

You should join the program because you help people by bring the animals and you have fun at the same time. I want to go back and join the program because it was the best thing ever and it opened up the world to me by exploring and seeing other countries. When I saw the family's in need my family hosted a number of exchanged students for many years.                ",2
1574cc3,Driverless cars are a bad idea it is better to stick with smart cars because smart cars are alot more helpful they can help the driver alot more. Driverless cars require massive upgrades to alread existing roads which cost alot of money. Smart cars can help the driver know when he has to be more carefull or when the roads are bad in the area he is driving and he could do what ever it takes to prevent and accident. GM smart cars have vibrating seats to warn the driver when its going to hit and object when its driving in reverse. Smart cars could handle trying up tp 25 mph but the sensors make sure that the driver keeps hand on the wheel. Manufactors are considering putting cameras to see when the driver loses focus on the road. Driverless cars are alot more dangerous because the driver won't have control over the wheel so if anything happens and the driver can get injured he is hoping that nothing wrong goes with the sensors. Driverless cars are a bad idea and smart cars are a better idea because all they have to do is add more things to smart cars and the smart car will be better.   ,2
b0314a4,"Humans should study Venus despite the dangers it could cause. Venus is one of the planets that is close to earth. It is often called Earth's twin. It is sometimes called the Evening Staras well. If we were to study Venus more we would learn more about its past.

Venus is a very dangerous planet to explore. Every mission to Venus had no humans on it. The reason their weren no humans is because the spacecraft would only last a few hours. Venus is filled with carbon dioxide. The planet is also very hot. The temperatures are usually over 800 degress Fahrenheit. Clouds of sulfuric acid is in the atmosphere. Even though their is alot keeping us back from visiting this planet, that should not keep us from learning more about it.

Astronomers say that Venus could have been the most Eart-like planet. According to the aricle, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus p4). This quote shows that Venus could have been like Earth. We'll never know if this is true if we don't learn more about Venus.

NASA is trying to find ways to send people to Venus. They are making machines that colud last for three weeks on Venus. They are thinking about ways we could live on Venus in the future. We should try and study Venus even though it could be dangers. According to the article, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginations and innovations.""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus p8). This quote tells us that we should not limit ourselves. This why we should try to study Venus despite the dangers.",3

One reason you should join is that you travel around the world. You can see lots of historical artifacts and great tourist destinations. Once I saw a excavated castle in Crete. Does that sound amazing? Well that wasn't all I saw the Panama Canal on the way to China. Is that marvelous or what!

If seeing the world isn't enough for you then helping others should. You can help millions of people just two to four weeks trip at a time. People need all the care they can get. Almost everything was lost in the war, and we can hlep with giving them cows, horses, and more. If we give them these animal it will also give them hope.

I am sure that last reson should have sold you over, but just to make sure I'll give you one more. Caring for the animals. Who doesn't like animals? I mean come on they are just like us, living things. Being living things, they need tending to. Like food, water, and a friend. That friend could be you.

There you have it three great reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Oh, and I almost forgot that when you done with your job, and are heading home the whole crew plays games. Example would be like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, and a whole bunch of other games. If I were you I would already be saying ""Deal!"" Although it's your decision. What do you say worth a try?",3
e98482d,"The world of Venus is very rough, and there are lots of hazards we must overcome if we plan on visiting the planet. The whole planet is filled with danger around every corner, and we would need alot of protection if we planed to visit this unknown world. It is a planet very close to Earth, but it is also extremely close to the sun, making it 800 degrees fahrenheit on the planets surface. There is also clouds of corrosive sulfuric acid, and powerfull volcanoes. Which makes the idea of actually stepping foot on the planet impossible.

If we founded research to go near the planet, and studied Venus from a blimp like aircraft it would help us with reseach of how the world looked up close, but we will never be able to actually take samples of the world, no ground samples or gass samples because its too risky. The idea of a aircraft hovering 30 miles above the planet sounds amazing, and makes u imagine what it would be like, but there would not be much progress due to not being able to take pictures of the planet. The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that light does not travel through it making prictures and videos completely inefective. Even after we get there and see the planet, what then the gass would not let us continue to explore the planet, and without any photos or evidence the public might not even beleave that it took place.

Nasa is working on many approaches to study and find ways to reach venus. They have tested the material silicon carbon, in a chamber simulating the conditions we may face on the planets surface. The materials lasted three weeks in the condition, but what if the world of Venus is even worse then the chamber Nasa has built, would humans only have a certain amount of time to study the planet before before there ship and them get dissolved by the planet?

The author is very smart and knows his facts, but he does not know how dangerouse the planet will be, Nasa should focas on Mars and not a planet so hard for us to travel and discover. We have sent rovers to mars and they have landed and some still work to this day, but every thing Nasa has sent to venus has failed, this is why we should choose the red planet.",4
24927d1,"When it comes to deciding wheather or not driverless cars should be used is up to everybody's own opinion. It is a pretty nice idea thoguh, having cars tat can drive for you while you also payattention is a fantasic idea. For example, take from paragragh 2, on how we have been fasintated by driverless cars. There have been at least more then twenty or so movies that have that idea, look at the movie called ""I Robot"". The cars can actually drive itself, but when it can't do that or when the drive wants to drive it shuts off with a smooth transition from one to the other. In addition, having a car that can drive itself but also have the sensors that need a human touch is a great idea, it makes sure that the driver it paying full attention, but also gives the driver some lee-way room when on the road. In addition, it is great that some cars like the BMW's can drive up to 25 mph when the car is in a area where there could be road work or traffic jams.

But in contrast, paragragh 9 made perfect a statement when saying/asking who will be at fault if the car crashes. If the car has a technology problem, does that mean the manufacurer is to blame or if the car is switching to person driving and it glitches out who is to blame then. In addition, when driverless car start to make advances in the world, does that mean we will no longer need to get driver licences, no longer need to have back ground knowledge on how the roads work and how to operate them if the cars system doesn't work. Will we no longer need to have any background on how to drive and how to operate them. In consculsion, it is a great advancement in are socitiy today, to have driverless cars, but down in the long run it make not ne the advancement that everybody will want to have for the future gernerations to come.",3

Driverless cars would be great to have but what would power them. Would they be solar powered or battrie powered, if the were solar powered and you needed to got do something and it was a cloudy day with no sun? When the driverless cars come into the human world are they going to be a big hit or are they going to be a flop? If human don't have to driver unless they have to it will give people more tme to do work if they need to. If some one worked for a big newspaper it would give them just a little bit more time to get a story done compared to when they had to drive to work.

If some one needed to be to a certin place in a rush would the driverless car be fast enough to get them there? Could the driverless cars be wifi capatable, however, that would put the price of the driverless car at an even higher price. Driverless cars are driven by a binary code, what is the probability of some one hacking into the control system and cause the car to do what they want it to do and not what the driver wants to do. The driverless cars have the antilock breaks so that could be a plus if it hit a slick spot in a major snow event. Will the driverless cars be two wheel or four wheel drive, if they are four wheel drive the driver could go almost anywhere. Driverless cars could help in wars becuase the commander could lead his troops in to battle and what if the tanks where driverless then it would give the fighter in side more oppertounity to fight out side the tank insted of in side of it.

666a03a,"Have you ever wondered what are the advantages of limiting car usage? Here are a few advantages that have actually helped in the real world, Less Smog, More stores in walking distance.

The first advantage was less smog. In Paris there was typically more smog than other European capitals. On mondays people were ordered to leave their cars at home or get fined a 22 euro fine ($31). It says in source 2 ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital, after five days of intensifying smog."" That quote right there shows that with people using their cars less there wouldnt be as much traffic as there was in the past and it has lessened the polution that was in the air. It says ""Exceptions were made for plug-in cars,hybrids,and cars carrying three or more passengers"", This was probably more enviormental friendly because those cars dont really use diesel fuel as apposed to the regular cars. As a result of all of that the smog cleared enough monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban for tuesday.

The second advantageof limiting car usage is it makes peoples lives a little more easier. For example, Now there is less space for parking and more space for stores to be placed a walk away, On a main street, rather then in malls along a distant highway.

In conclusion the advantages of limiting your car usage helped reduce smog, and make peoples life easier by reducing green house gasses and creating less space for parking and making more space for stores to be placed a walk away, on a main street rather than in malls along a distant highway.

fe38c11,"The driverless cars are changing the face of today's transportation. They are an upcoming development of regular cars. There are many improvements that are being made in order for these cars to become a popular trend in the near future of public transportation. The improvemnts of these cars do, indeed have positive aspects to them. I am for the driverless cars because they can be an efficient way of transportation in the future.

The development of the driverless cars can create a positive impact on our society. The positive aspects are important for these cars because it allows for them to be more safe. ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. this necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention whenever a problem occurs."" This aspect here, further explains how and why the driverless cars are a more safer use of transportation for people. Even though there are negative aspects to the driverless cars, the improvements being made can make the cars safer as well. ""GM has developed driver""s seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."" These cars would be more effective because they are making drivers, themselves, more aware of what is going on around them. Regular cars today, make it difficult for people to use transportation, than driverless cars actually would. ""The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus."" The driverless cars are going to allow people to be worry-free about getting from place to place, as well as the amount of gas that it usually takes. To clarify, I am for these cars because they are a better way of using transportaton.

In conclusion, the driverless cars are making driving become more safe and efficient. The manufactures are aware of the changes that are going on in the society today, therefore the improvements of these cars are becoming relevant to the world around us. I am for the driverless cars because I believe that they are going to eventually shape the future of the world's public transportation system.",3
07eb783,"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuite all the dangers it presents. Venus is the second planet from our sun .While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous sacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in Venus's atmosphere

However ,perring at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far abover the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because mot forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere ,rendering standard forms of photgraphy and videography ineffective .

NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus .For examle ,some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been teted in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weks in such conditions .The thought of devices make a calculation by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all.

Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our planet .The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys ,mountainsand crater ,Furthermore,recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit ,a curcial consideration given the long time frames of space travel

In conclusion of the authors suggestion on studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depsite all the dangers it presents .I think that people should really study Venus and its features that it comes with it does with dangers but you would get a lot out of it just reading this makes you want to go visit Venus.

8102b68,"The using of cars has caused much of the worlds green house gas imitions, in America as much as 50% of the imitions are caused souly by transportation. Many people feel that this is destroying our atmosphere and that we should cut down on imitions by walking, biking or car pooling. Efforts to cut down keep our atmosphere clean and breathable. Some communities such as Vauban, Germany have illiminated car use entirely.

Vauban is a new experimental suburb where there is no street parking or driveways and the only place to park is in a garage where you must buy a space for 40,000 which has cut the car ownership rate down to only about 30%. There are as many as 5,500 residents in Vauban and most of them say they like it much better without having to worry about a car. In many suburbs however the houses are much to far apart for them to be car-free, though many areas are considering developments like this one so they can clean up the air.

Other cities, such as Paris, are fourced to ban driving for days at a time in order to clear the thick smog that hovers above the city. On one day odd numbered plates won't be allowed to drive and on the next day even, volaters are fined $31. As many as 4,000 drivers are fined. Only once the smog was sufficently cleared did they allow both plate types to drive. Limiting driving can prevent problems like this from occuring in all cities.

In Colombia they have a day where all cars are banned, chalanging the inhabitance to find alternate routs of travel for fear of the $25 fine for violators. The day without cars began in the mid-1990's for Bogota, a city with a population of 7 million, has participated, but last year two other cities in Colombia joined in. Dispite the rainy weather many people still hiked or rode their bikes. Many citizens say that it keeps the cities air clear and that its nice to have a day without traffic jams filling the streets. The Day without cars is an event that many countries hope to adopt.

Studies show that many people from the newest generation aren't bothering to get a licence. Cell phones and apps make car pooling easy and the internet allows you to interact with friends without having to drive to visit them. Experts are hoping this trend will continue and that it will cut down the gas imitions. With increased use of social networking technology hopefully people will also become more aware of how they are affecting their planet and move to help others cut down as well.            ",4

Venus is a planet that will soon be explored NASA has been sending spacecrafts to land on venus but they still don't make it,

For three decades many factors contribute to venus reputation and has been a challenge for humans to study, even thoe 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets venus and clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere and a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what we expirence on earth those conditions are way to extreme that humans don't encounter that on earth

Another reason why it should be studied more and have future plans that someday people from NASA will land is that because many astronomers believe that venus may have once been the most earth-like planet in our solar system and that venus was onced probably covered largely with oceans and could've been many forms of life in venus many many years ago.

Many scientist are looking for a way to get samples of rocks,gas,or anthing else that they can use to find out more about venus but they cannot do that. many researchers are working on innovations that will allow machines to last longer so they can get enough samples for them.

719eb62,"Do aliens live on Mars?

Some people belive that the face found on Mars was created by aliens.

This information is unaccurate.

The face on Mars was not created by aliens, it is actually a natural landform.

The Face of Mars is a natural landform which can be proven by research conducted by NASA.

NASA claims that the face seen by the Viking 1 photo in 1976 is mearly a natural landform.

This can be proven by information found on April 8, 2001 when Garvin's team captured an image at 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in 1976.

With this amount of precision, other things created by aliens would have been able to have been witnessed as well.

NASA is also the most trusted and deserving space agency because of past information that is trusted by most of the world.

NASA has also released a statement saying that the Martian butte or mesa are landforms common around the American West.

Garvin says,"" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

In this article, there is evidence that proves that the Face on Mars is a natural landform.

This information can be shown in paragraph 3 where it says,"" huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

This information shows that NASA knows that this was made by shadows and not aliens.

Also, in paragraph 11 where it states,"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size,"" he added.

"" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

This statement proves that since there was no other evidence pointing toward the fact of aliens creating this Face, there is only one explanation which is that the Face is a natural landform just as we have here on Earth.

Furtermore, in paragraph 12, the author mentions that the the picture,"" is the Martian equvalent of a butte or mesa.""

Humans have buttes and mesa down on Earth which are natural landforms.

This proves that the landforms there could have been created the same way on Mars as they were on Earth.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is actually just a natural landform that happened to have the perfect shadowing at the perfect time.

The theory that aliens created this landform is outragous compared to the facts given by NASA to prove that this is a landform.",3
35d6b4b,"Dear Senator,

If one could sum up the definition of the Electoral College in a few words, those words would be unessasary and room for error. The Electoral College was established by our fore fathers in the constution. Paragraph one in What is the Electoral College by the Office of the Federal Register states ""A compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" It is more than possible that a change in our voting system could better america in all kinds of ways.

I believe that the electoral College takes away the peoples opinion in a way just descreet enough to still call it a democracy. The people still vote and determine the overall outcome of the election, But with an electoral college, there is more then enough room for error. One argument aganist the Electoral College is in the very purpose of the system. The people votes go to an electors slate that share the same view as you, then they vote for a candidate. This is opposed to the peoples vote going directly to the candidate. This method of voting is if not purposeless then problematic. Electors can betrey your trust and vote for the opposite canadidate. A statement from Brandford Plumers' The Indefensible Electoral College says ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.""

In America our society is based off of freedom and the electoral college is not promoting it. Please keep in mind that the legislature is nearly compleatly responsable for choosing our electors. At any election they could defy the peoples choice. Excerp from The Indefensible Electoral states ""back in 1960, segregationists in the louisana legislature neary succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" Electors have occasinally been know for simply refusing to vote for their party's candidate. If this is freedom to vote then there undoubtingly needs to be a change in the near future.

Scandles like the one thay occured in 1960 rarely happen, but whos to say that it could not happen in the future. Our presidental election is practically based off of trust in our goverment. The Electoral college does reconize voters from each region of the county but due to the way the system is set up, it does a poor job interpreting the votes of the people.

A quote from In Defence of the Electoral College by Richard A. Posner states ""It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popluar vote"" This happened as recently as the election of 2000 Then ask yourself what would really be the harm of ingoring the Electoral College. It only would make the outcome clearer.

The American elections differ from most countrys in the way that we are a democrecy. we the people can vote. we the people have individual voices that are the composition of the country. The elector college does not oppose this. But rather is opening the doors for coruption. Taking away the Electoral College and replacing it with popular vote, is simply clarifying the peoples decisions, and the peoples decisions is nothing less then America itself.                                    ",4
dc7bb46,"Dear Senator, i am writing this letter in regaurds to the way we citizens vote. I feel as though we should vote using the popular vote. There are many different reasons i feel so strongly about this. So i will start telling you why i feel so strongly about this.

First,i think that the President and Vice President should be choose by our votes. The reason being is becasue we know what we want for our country. we look for the good and things like that in our president. I think it is only fair that we use the voting tecnique most votes because that means everyone gets a say on who runs our country.

Another reason i think we should go that route is beacuse people sometimes feel left out in all the things that have to do with our country. People want a president that keeps his/her word and one that can be the right person for the job. They want someone who knows who to be a leader because the person who gets chosen has this job for 4 years. I think that people have a right to vote for who they want to vote for not who the electors pick . I have no idea if this is aking any type of sense but i am writing this the best way i understand it.

That is how i feel about this whole thing i think people should have equal rights.  I also think that people should be able to pick who they want to be their leader. They should be able to view thier opitions and see what is best for not only the country but aslo their familes and themselfs.

Many people are always needing to travel from place to place and don't always want to drive. It's more convenient to just hitch a ride from someone such as a friend or a taxi. But sometimes those aren't always the most convenient options. Taxi drivers could take someone anywhere or your friend could be under the influence.

They are also more convenient because sometimes people could be impaired and unable drive, so they would just have a driverless car pick them up instead. This way, it is convenient for people to travel without worrying if they are going to be safe or not.

A main factor in people buying cars is if they are safe. According to the article on Driverless Cars Are Coming, these independent cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. People could be safer in a driverless car than with someone driving a car. Safety is a huge deal in our society and people buying cars want what's best for them and their families. If driverless cars are safer, companies will have good sales and produce better profit. This way, the economy is being benefitted and so is society.

In the world today, we try to conserve our resources as much as possible. Fuel is a major resource that is used to power a lot of things in everyday life. By using driverless cars, we would limit our use of fuel to half of what taxis use, and that is phenomenal. Inventions like the driverless car can lead to preserving resources. Conserving our resources is an important thing we need to do, and fundamental developments like the driverless car can help us achieve our goal in doing that.

The research on these cars is significant for people in the future. Many years ago we would have never known all the important things about technology that we know today. By researching and testing the technology of the driverless car, we have produced more efficient knowledge for the future. Driverless cars need sensors to operate similar to a human driving the car, which is important to creating cars. Without researching and inventing these important products, we wouldn't have half the knowledge on cars that we have today.

Driverless cars are beneficial to us because they are convenient, safe, fuel-saving, and important to our knowledge on cars. Driverless cars can help people in society and people in the future. The development of these cars can influence people to create even bigger things in the future and that is incredible. The future is brighter than it has ever been, and the development of such a product has made this possible. The future is bright and driverless cars have led us further down the road to creating newer, better inventions.            ",4
aeb20e5,"Mona Lisa is a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci. There is many theories of Mona Lisa being sad, or feeling many other emontion but no body knows the truth but Da Vinci.

Based on the text evidence,

"" Making Mona Liza Smile,""

a new software called Facial Action Coding System has been developed to try infenitfing Mona Lisa's facial expressions. She could have up to six different basic emontions.

First of all, Mona Lisa overall expressions use she is 83% happy.

Based on this article, "" the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). each expression is compared against neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This is saying that even that she shows no expressions, she is certainly happy but might be having mix feelings as well.

Another reason Mona Lisa can be feeling disgusted, fearful, or even angry but yet she's very mysterious. In the text it says, "" most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc.""

If humans have trouble figuring out if something is feeling happy or sad, how can a software be able to do such thing.

The software FACS is interesting becuase it's able to know your emotions with any movement you do. For example, in the text it says, "" even though individuals often show varying degress of expressions. Using a video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks thsee facial movements."" If a gental move can determine an emotion, this software will have a challenge on finding out Mona Lisa's emotions because it's just a painting.

Therefore, Mona Lisa will be mysterious until the software identifies her emotions. Mona Lisa is and will always be a unique peice of art. ",1
1732f3a,"Limiting car use can help us live better lives. The terrible smog that harms the environment called pollution is caused by the excessive use of vehicles in communities. I believe limiting car use can help us reduce pollution, more accessibility to public transportation, and helps you save money. Reducing the use of vehicles can help the environment. Join in and make the world a better place, literally.

With less cars being used in communities the risk of pollution can be decreased. When you don't use your car you help the environment. People use cars to go to places they can easily walk to, but they don't. Some people don't even care about the environment or if they harm it. By reducing the car use in many communities pollution can be greatly reduced.

Public transportation is cheap and quick. Using more public transportation helps you save money and helps the environment. Pollution can be reduced by just taking the bus instead of your own car. According to ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky more people tend to get the initiative to take public transportation. You don't have to do something extraordinary to help the environment, maybe all you need to do is take the bus.

People tend to buy less cars if you limit car usage. The less cars you buy means the more money you save. According to ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal a study found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. The people who drove less between that time must have saved alot of money on gasoline. When you don't use your car as much it ends up benefiting everybody.

By limiting the useage of cars the environment benefits a great deal. Pollution can be reduced to a point where it causes minimal harm if everybody decides to pitch in. Transportation will recieve more funding. You will be able to save plenty of money on gas and use it for whatever other purpose you may need it. In conclusion, car useage should be reduced so that everyone may benefit from it.    ",4
38aeea4,"Ever confused in the classroom? Some pieces of technology can detect emotions from people or even students. Having technology in the classroom is valuable to students because the computer can adjust to each students learning method, it can go at a pace that is comfortable for the student, and in the end the student learns more.

When doing assignments in the classroom, many methods can be found when doing numerous things, like figuring out a math problem or chemistry equation. In the passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the Dr. Huang says, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", this shows that the student does not understand the assignment or is not interested. The computer can easily adjust that by changing the method or make the learning more entertaining while the student is still learning. Some students have a harder time learning in the classroom because they don't understand how the answer is being found. With technology changing the method in which a student can learn, the student may be able to grasp the topic at hand better. The adjustment to the way in which the student learns may help, but the time it takes a student to learn is also another major factor why technology can benefit the classroom.

Students go at all different paces, some are slower than others and some are faster than others. However, technology can find the pace the student feels comfortable learning in just by the way they look at the computer. If the student is a slow learner, the computer would take it slow and teach the lesson at a slower pace. If the student is a quick learner, than the computer may speed through the lesson with no problem. This would allow the student to effectively learn.

The student can learn more just by making a facial expression towards a piece of technology such as a computer. By using facial recognition, the computer would know what to do and the student would feel more enthusiastic about learning in the classroom.

Technology in the classroom would open up new doors for students and the way they learn. Dr. Huang from the passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" says, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication'"", this means that the facial expressions a student makes is like a language and it can be understood by the advancements in technology. Having facial recognition on computers in the classroom would be valuable to students because it can teach the student a lesson that would fit in to how the student wants to learn, the amount of time it takes for a student to learn would be adjusted, and the student can effectively comprehend what is being taught in the classroom. Technology plays an important role in society today and later it can teach new things that many people don't know. ",4
6290382,"Dear,Mr Senator

My name is PROPER_NAME, and I am writing to you to say why we should keep the elctoral college. What do you think, should we keep the electoral college? wirte me back and tell me what you think. but any way these are my three reason on why we should keep the electoral college.

My first reason is on why we should keep the electoral college is because, there is a reason on why it is there in the first place. Im not that smart but im pretty sure the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they started the electoral college. it is there because it helps pick who is president and vice president. I mean sure we do help by voting but there job is to pick the best one, by compareing statistics.

My  second reason for why we should keep the electoral college is because the people arent always right. Yes i said that the people arent always right, take for instance the George Bush we messed up big time by electing him, look what happened to the economy, but that is what we get by letting the peple pick. Im not saying that we dont know how to make a right descion but can we please let the professionals do what they do best.

My third and final reason is that they do elect fairly  the bigger thye state you have the mor represenatives you recive, states like California,texas,wyoming,ect which means the bigger the state the more people sre going to live in that stae which would also mean that you would have more represenatives. i know that your saying how is that fair if just because you a bigger state you get more represenatives? well as i said in the last sentace it is because of population. because of population to even out the votes you would have to have more represenatives.

Those were my top three reasons on why we should keep the electoral college. I hop that you agree with my reasons on why we should keep the electoral college.

Yours truley

0649f8e,"I think that you should get rid of the electoral college because it makes the popular vote unfair. If you are saying we aren't voting for the president we want then we are just voting for the electoral voters we want without knowing that. The electoral college is unfair because if we vote who we want to then we will just get the votes of some electoral voter and if we vote for them they could vote for whoever they wanted to vote for.

If everyone voted for someone thew electoral voters could just vote for whoever they wanted to and we wouln't be able to stop them either. We should change it to popular vote because the electoral college is unfair to everyone who votes for someone. Its not fair because the eletoral vote can make a president lose even if he had the popular vote is on his side.

It should be changed because there is always the disaster factor. If their is a tie then they will just deny the will of the people. If they deny the will of the people it could have disasterous results. It should be changed because it is unfair and it always will have the chance of the disaster factor.      ",2

Even though these missions to Venus are dangerous, we still need to explore what we can. In ¨The Challenge of Exploring Venus,¨ the author states that studying Venus is a worthly persuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports this idea by describing how Venus might have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.

The author supports that Venus is worth exploring despite the dangers because it might have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In paragraph 4, the author describes how important it is that we explore Venus, and how similar Earth is to this planet. ¨Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" (4). This quote explains how similar Earth was to Venus and also describes the need for discovery. Venus is worthy to be explored despite the dangers because we need to see why Venus is no longer like Earth and why it doesn´t have forms of life on it anymore. Going to Venus would be a worthy persuit because we are very limited to the planets that we can explore and Venus is one of the only planets to visit right now with our current technology. This evidence proves the author suggesting how important it is to go on an exploration to Venus because it used to be similar to Earth, but it has vastly changed and we need to see how and why.

In conclusion, the author supports the idea thoroughly that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by describing how Venus might have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. The fact that Venus and Earth used to be so similar is important because scientists need to discover why Venus is so different and how this happened. Going through with this exploration would be extremely benificial and would open up new ideas on how we can save our planet today. ",3
74733b7,"Transpotation has been a key part of many socities around the world today; from getting to and from jobs, visiting familes, and running common everyday errands that life brings. But, in some areas, they are opting to go car-free, and in many ways, it is making positive impacts within these evolving areas. From lowering emissions and greenhouse gases, to providing a more stress-free way of living, opting out on cars can make huge positve effects that everyone should look into.

Cars, especially in the United States and other leading nations, have many suburban ideals that bring them to have one of ""the world's prime car cultures"". The U.S, for example, is the birthplace of the Model T, one of the first cars that was ever made. However, over the last decade, America's love for cars has gone down slightly, and is headed lower each year. Looking into the future, this shift could have great affects on today's socities; which includes letting off fewer carbon emissons into the enviornment. This decrease would happen because transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions into the atmosphere, just behind Power Plants. Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gases in  Lowering the amount of car emissions will additionally help achieve President Obama's goals of helping the enviornment and doing something good towards it during his time as President.

In addition, France is a prime example of how lowering the amount of cars on streets will have positive outcomes on the enviornment. Because of excessive amounts of smog in air in Paris, they came up with a clever system to reduce the amounts. An alternate day schedule is what was put in place, allowing motorists with even numbered license plates to drive one day, and odd-numbered drivers the next. Failure to leave their cars at home on the days that don't apply to them resulted in a 22-euro fine, which didn't stop some drivers. But, despite their reactions, the idea had many postive impacts and cleared the air of smog. Countries all around the world have seen the impressive facts come to life that reducing driving can lower the amount of emissions we put into the enviornment.

Limiting the amount of cars on the road also has other advantages other than the postive impacts it can make on the enviornment. Germany, for example, is experimenting by forbidding street drving, driveways, and home garages near the french and swiss borders (Vauban). As a result, 70% of Vauban's families do not even own cars and 57% sold a car to move there. One resident says ""When I had a car I always always tense. I'm much happier this way"". This idea shows how being car-free can lower stress levels               ",4

The driver has to stay aware of the other things around them. Even thought you still have to keep your hands on the wheel because of the touch sensors. The article states, ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" This statment shows there is still room for human error in these driverless cars.

Even though human error is still involved, these cars still can't go through construction areas or around wrecks but they still alert you when you come across it.

the prompt states, ""But all are designed when the road requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around acciedents. this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" People are still needed to drive these cars, but we still have to do the hard part the old fashion way.

Even with accident warning, these cars are still not legal in some states like California and Nevada. For example, ""As a result it is illegal even to test computer- driven cars.

In paragraph 3 the autor states one of the most significant reasons, it says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun... Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"", this the dangerous problem in this project. The planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than

what experience on our own planet.

Scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk. According to paragraph 6 it says "" Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaninfully to our knoledge of Venus"" this paragraph let us know that they are working to reach there and looking to survive more time.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick D'Alto goes into great depth about how a new computer system, Facial Action Coding Sytem, can revolutionize multiple industries. He began to describe the famous Mona Lisa drawing and how they were able to calculate her facial expressions with the new facial recognition system. He then broadens the topic by explaining how the computer system actually works. After going into even greater detail about the computer process, he begins to describe the many benefits that the Facial Action Coding System will bring. After reading this article, one can agree that the Facial Action Coding System should be implemented into classrooms to read student's emotional expressions for various reasons.

First of all, the use of Facial Action Coding System could enhance the education levels being taught in classrooms by individually designing lessons for students. At one point in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Prof. Thomas Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto 6). By modifying the lesson to the students' needs, this can improve testing scores in classrooms, ensuring that most students will easily learn more based on their facial expressions.

Secondly, the Facial Action Coding System can help with discipline areas among schools. In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Prof. Thomas Huang explains how muscles contribute to a large portion of reading facial expressions. At one point he claims, ""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity aren't being truthful"" (D'Alto, 8). By pointing the idea out of spotting false facial expressions, the Facial Action Coding System can be used in schools and other places to help detect people who may be lying or trying to hide the truth. Instead of adults trying to pry kids open and ""spill the beans"", they can simply use the computer system to recognize certain facial expressions and then start from there.

Overall, there are many benefits to the Facial Action Coding System, and although some may be more beneficial than others, they each take part in bettering academics and schools in general. By personalizing lessons and helping with disciplinary actions, schools can loosen their grips from a tight load of work on their shoulders and allow the Facial Action Coding System to ""lend a hand"". One can really see how incorporating this system will not only benefit the staff and faculty of schools, but also the many children striving for excellence in academics and character. ",4
9301582,"Five cities have been reported to have had a day to where they banned cars. They call these days, ""Car Free Days"". Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; Bogota, Colombia; Cali Colombia; and Valledupar Colombia. This day ended with positive results.

For starters, the residents in Vaulban, Germany have given up their cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbudden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg. Vauban's streets are completely ""car free""--except the main thoroughfare. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park--large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for forty thousand dollars, along with a home. As a result, seventy percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and fifty seven percent sold their cars just to move here. In the passage, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two, she quotes,"" When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""

Additionally, Cars are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai ten to make  their homes. Experts say that that is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emmissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

Futhermore, after days of near-record pollution, Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, states that congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France, after just five days of intensifying smog.

So, in summation, there are some advantages of limiting car usage. By limiting car usage, you're also limiting pollution, carbon emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, etc.    ",2
fcab2b2,"Technology has grown more and more over the years, and sometimes we're for sure lucky to have the technology we do have today. The use of this new technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because we should not always trust our eyes, it helps us to better understand what it is we're looking at, and knowing what others around you and what your looking at, can reflect on how you feel as a person.

When looking at a picture of someone smiling, you may think they're happy. Although they're smiling, that smile could surely be fake. What if they threw the smile on so people would think that they're okay? Maybe they just dont want to be bothered. You can't always trust what it is, that your eye is seeing. With this technology, you don't have to trust your eyes to tell how the person in this work of art is feeling. With a few simple steps, you can tell what the emotions in the paintings are. ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how mcuh this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad"".

This new technology helps us better understand what it is that we are looking at. This Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The Facial Action Coding System gathers what muscular action units are being used. The muscular action units is how the Coding System collects its data and registers what it is the person is feeling. ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"".

Whether it's a family picture you're looking at, or a painting by the greatest painter of all time, If it makes you happy, hinting a genuine smile, can reflect on how you feel. If you know that a painting of sunflowers, is something that you like to see, can cheer you up a little. Although you're not going to be the happiest person in the world because you looked at a picture/painting you enjoy seeing, you will for sure be more happy! ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"".

In all reality, technology has had a huge impact on our lives, and we would be lost if it was to be taken from us. This technology may have one of the biggest impacts on our life since smarthphones had first came out. Maybe this will soon be the ""style"". The use of this new technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because we should not always trust our eyes, it helps us to better understand what it is we're looking at, and knowing what others around you and what your looking at, can reflect on how you feel as a person.

7b1c1cd,"As time progresses, so do classroom education and the technological innovations applied to it. While teachers search for helpful methods to engage their pupils in education, the world of science develops more and more inventions, such as the Facial Action Coding System, to improve standards of living. Despite its putative effectiveness in other fields such as advertisement or marketing, Facial Action Coding System technology possesses no place of value in a classroom and would serve as a hinderence to a student's learning process.

Although this software may serve as an effective source of profit for online corporations, it has no valueable place in classrooms. In the sixth paragraph of the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author illuminates the possibilites of success human-emotion-recognizing computer software provides in terms the world of marketing, describing how analyzing the emotional response to a Web ad popping up on one's computer screen can mold the variety of its future ads to a more preferred selection (6). While this software may be helpfully applicable to marketing schemes, its analyzation of human emotions would only deter from a student's learning in the classroom due to its possible misinterpretations and miscalculations. Verbal human communication is relied upon to determine what about a lesson plan confuses a student, and although a computer might register a student's confused expression and recognize that the lesson pace might be too fast for this individual scholar, the computer would be unable to pinpoint what exactly the student fails to understand. Other events may be weighing down heavily on a student's mind, causing their face to contort and convey the emotions brought on from factors outside of the learning setting. A change in emotion not caused by a difficult lesson plan would cause the software to possibly alter the lesson pace when the student did not require any adjustment and ultimately generate frustration in the already distressed student.

Although each day, more and more opportunities to develop and improve technology and learning are created, sometimes these brilliant innovations do not mesh well with education. Despite the proposed effectiveness this software can serve for marketing companies, Facial Action Coding System would only produce obstacles to a student's learning process, ultimately diminishing any value it could potentially possess in a classroom.",5

I'am a scientist at NASA, and i am trying to explain that the face that everyone saw on the planet Mars was not created by aliens. It was created by naturel landform. There are many clues that the face was created by natural landform. Also many people can disagree with me, but I will prove to you that it was not created by aliens.

Many people thought that the face was created by aliens because at the time they did not have much eveadince of it was real or not. They thought that unusal shadows made it look like an Egyptin Pharaoh. We then showed people the pictures of the so what called face. It became a big hit everywhere, and people loved it. Some people thought it led to maybe living things being there. It then became an acient civlazation on mars.

In about April 5, 1998 they sent another ship out to take more adavnced pictures. These fine pictures would be much sharper, and they would capture more evedince. 1,000s of people waited to see what the fastinting pictures would bring a new. It revealed a natural landform and there came to be no alien monument after all. Many people were disapointed. They wanted to belive that it was real. Well, I am here to tell you that it is not real.

As you can tell there was a lot of dispute going on. Some people did not want to belive that it was not real. They wanted to keep trying. They then wanted to take a second look. The poeple wanted to make sure that we did not miss anything. We had an extraordinary photo that had pixel spans that were 1.56 meters. That was much better compared to1976 when the yfirst took the picturses.

What the picture actually showed was land forms that were common around the Amercian West.

Now do you see why the face was not created by aliens. Yes, maybe at one point in time it seemed like it could of been real, but all in the end it was not. It just took a little explaning and evidence over the photographs. In my opoion it would have been pretty amazing to of been that way. I guess some things just do not happen like that, and maybe some things happen for a reason. With my helpful eveidence and my clues I hope that you now understand why the face was not created by aliens, but why it was created by the natrual landforms. ",4

Because they would have resived the most information and attention there is from the candidates. They are likely to be the most thoughtful people when its comes down to voting. It says ""the most thoughtful voters should be the once to decide the election"". Do you agree with this statement yes, or no?. My answer would be no, because everybody is living in the country that wants a vote from everyone so why only accept the votes that are thoughtful. We are all one so we should all vote and choose who we would like as a President of the United State.                   ",2

But in a city that has no cars driving around, you don't have to worry about that at all. You can not worry about how much the gas prices are because you may be car pooling or taking the bus. In ""

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars""

by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she asked a citizen on what she thought of the no car law, she said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" (line 3), she saw how having no fast-moving hunks of metal can be a very stressless situation. A community that doesn't have this stress can worry about other things now.

It's often talked about in the news. Greenhouse gasses. Global warming. We hear about all the time and how it's affected by emissions of cars. How could we avoid it? Simple, we stop driving around so much. Cars in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and we in the United States make up 50 percent of it (Elisabeth Rosenthal, line 5). It's especially bad in Paris, where the gasses are so bad that there was 5 days of smog, only rivaled by Beijing, China the most polluted city in the world (Robert Duffer, line 14), which it's so bad in Beijing the citizens of the city have to wear masks covering their noses and mouths to protect themselves from the harmful gasses. It's horrible that people have to live in such horrible conditions.

If you gave up driving to everywhere you go, you wouldn't just help the world with greenhouse gasses, you'd also be helping yourself. People nowadays sit at home watching TV and snacking. But do you know how much walking and biking could do to help the health of people. This would be the case if there was a limitation on driving cars. Getting exersize is also a great stress-reliever. Also it helps with the nasty smog that's been mentioned. People wouldn't be breathing in harmful gasses if there was a limitation or ban to car usage in most contries. Air pollution effects all of us as human beings.

Most of us can't think of a society without cars, but it's very possible. We can, however, make a society exactly like that to some extent. Running around screaming about global warming won't do much unless you take action. Not only will it help the Earth to have better air, it can help lead a more stress-free, safe life and a healthier one that'll only need you to walk or bike to some places.    ",4
3ad3cd5,"Dear state senator.

I think that the electoral collage should be changed because it makes voting unfair, more people would vote,and it would be more effective.

The electoral voting system is unfair because your vote dosnt really count if the majority of the votes goes to the opposing party. It would be more even if your vote counted directly towards the party rather than voting for your states electors. I also feel that more people would vote because with the state electors your vote wont matter if the majority of is oppiste of who you voted for.

Also, other people would vote for other parties more rather than just the democratic or republican parties because the majority of the people are just gonna vote for those parties.

If the votes were not for the state electors and for the president than George W. Bush would not have been elected and the majority of the votes went towards John kerry so that wasnt fair for him.

Also every states number of electors is different, if they are going to have electors per state I think it should be the same amount for every state because if more of the states voted for the republicans but the democrats could have had the states with the larger amount of electors and won the election. The tinier states wouldnt do much for the election if they only have three electors. Also without electors voting, there would be a less chance of there being a tie in the election. It might make counting the votes easier but voting would be more effective if it was without state electors.

Those are the reasons why I think that the way voting is should be changed and hopfully someday it will be.    ",3
919ecf5,"The statement that has been gooing around stating ""the face on Mars was created by aliens."" The statement is false, the face you have seen on mars is a natural landform. The photos you have seen was a hill developing in the process over time. We have taken a photo of the strange spot on the planet Mars and it has been reported,that it is a natural landform.

We did not have the same technology as what we have had in the past. When we first took the picture we did not have the same technology so we had a blurry picture. But when we have our technology now, we have better cameras so that we can get a better image of the big red planet called Mars. We have no proof that aliens have built this face in the surface on mars. This face you see on the planet is just a landform.

The face you might see in the photograph is just a mind illusion that you might see a face. the face you see is a hill that has been formed by the ways of the planet its self. It might have been molding from the dust and the wind dragging the red sand and dirt off of the hill its self.

We have no way or knowledge to know that aliens have built this face on the hill. The face has been forming for probably thousands and thousands of years. We think the forming on mars, like craters and hole in the ground, plus the face is just a natural landform forming on the crust of mars its self. How would we know if other forms of life built this face?...We dont know because we do not have that much knowledge about the space. There are infifnity of space out their that we have not explored yet so how would we know if the aliens have built this.

The thought of this statement that aliens have built this face in the crust of mars is ludicris. The face on mars has been formed by natural landformings in the crust of Mars. The theory of aliens made the face is as dumb as a bump on a log.        ",3

05e6736,"A driverless car? Now that's ridiculous. How are you suppossed to get your licenses when you're older? People are going to depend on manufacturer cars. I think this is unnessesary because the future generation isn't going to learn how to drive an actual real car. Cars that humans can actually drive.

In most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. California, Nevada, Flordia, and even the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Yeah, it's okay to have driverless cars around, but only for certain emergencies. Driverless cars can even take over people's jobs! And what are those people going to do without a job?

If the technology fails and someone is injured, who's at fault the driver or the manufacturer? Probably the driver because he or she didn't took over when the emergency was occuring. And what if that certain person didn't have a license? Even though traffic laws change we are still not garunteed that we will be safe inside a driverless car. New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident.

In conclusion, we are still going to be in risk. I still think it's a ridiculous idea. I predict that they are going to be more accidents than they are in regular cars. The road to autonomous cars stretches on over the years. We are growing closer and closer to the destination every day. Do you think driverless cars will take over? ",3

Because the electoral college does have some things in it that are procieved as wrong and people want to change about it. And honestly i think i would be alot better if it was just the popular vote because then mre people would be satisfied with who their president is. Knowing that its someone they voted for ad not someone in which the electoral college votes for and decides to make the president. some presidents win the popular vote but still lose the presidency because they didnt get enough electoral votes. I would prefer a direct vote from popular votes.

I dont think it is that much fair if someone wins the popular vote but still dosent get picked to be the president because of the electoral college.

The Face is just a natural landform because it was a cloudy day on Mars when the spacecraft took the pictures, you would be able to see objects in the pictures if there were any, and the picture actually shows the Martian.

The Face is just a natural landform on the planet of Mars, not something created by alien life forms or evidence of life on Mars. For example, when the pictures were taken, it was a cloudy day on Mars. The clouds casted shadows on the landform to make it look like a face. There were no alien markings. If there were objects in the pictures you would be able to see them. You would be able to see the objects because you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. The picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. They are common around the American West.

c4949e2,"Every year, the residents of Bogota, Colombia celebrate a trending event known as Car-Free Day. This skyrocketing campaign has led to as many as 7 million people giving up cars for the day, which reduces air pollution, promotes exercise, and avoids traffic jams. This may seem like a strange phenomenon, but reduced driving is spreading all around the globe. Just to name an example, there are multiple towns who have also caught on; such as Vauban, Germany where only as many as 30 percent own cars.

There are multiple advantages to reducing cars from our lifestyles. A very large pro is how much we can reduce Greenhouse gasses. Not too long ago, there was a long span of near-record amounts of air pollution in Paris, France. In an attempt to fix this issue, they came up with a plan. The scheme was decided to order Even-numbered license plates to leave their cars behind for the day, or be fined $31 (22 Euros). Odd-numbered cars would be told the same would apply for them the following day. Unfortunately, approximately four thousand people were fined, with twenty seven others having their cars impounded. just after five days, the smog was so thick that it rivaled one of the most polluted areas in the world; Beijing, China. along with the weather, much of the smog was blamed by the massive amounts of diesel fuel that France uses. Many complained, but after accepting free public transit, and exceptions for hybrids and electric cars, the smog cleared enough for the French to take back the ban.

""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states,"" Claims Elisabeth Rosenthal, who wrote ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"". In response to some of these things, a recently finished city in Germany has completely car-free roads (with a few exceptions). This is because of a few reasons. Firstly, Vauban, Germany doesn't have any parking, driveways, or garages. the only place you can park is in either of the two large parking garages that you would buy a $40,000 parking space for, along with your home. This has resulted in seventy percent of the population of Vauban to be without cars, and about fifty seven selling theirs to move here. Suburbs like these have been trending all across Eurpope. In return, this has provied the community with less traffic, much less pollution, and the creation of denser cities so it's better for walking to and from the shops and resturuants on mainstreet. According to Heidrun Walter, who is a mother of two, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""

With more walking, and less sitting at the wheel, this can also provide more social interactions. Many people now ride bikes together to and from work, and there is less stress from traffic jams due to packed streets. This way, enviroments are more relaxed, open. Even for those who don't give up driving completely, now carpool and travel in groups to reduce gas use and air pollution.

This trend has even begun to spread to the United states, the car capital of the world. Although the Vehicle's immense popularity, the density of usage here has finally started to decline. Teens are getting their licenses later, and not even getting a car until much after. This is also a good thing for multiple reasons. There are less reckless teenagers roaming the streets, and much safer roads, along with the help of Carpooling, there is much less gas being used, and more excercise when people decide to ride their bikes or walk places.

There are numerous reasons we should reduce driving, Let it be reducing air pollution, promoting exercise, and avoiding traffic jams. even if we take small steps, we can create a much healthier lifestyle with just a small change.    ",5
1f3d9fd,"In the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"" two sides of whether there should or should not be driveless cars are given.

Through out the article both sides use experts from car companies and scientists to give their side, or opinion, of this argument.

Reasons such as drivless cars aren't completely driveless and still need the driver's attention are given which gives the reader a standpoint against this argument.

Driveless cars are expensive and dangerous.

In paragraph 6 of this article, it states that the make-up of a driveless car consists of sensors and other parts of the car add up to two hundred million dollars to manufacture.

Another fact given in paragraph 7 states that ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel.""

The quote just given shows how driveless cars aren't truly driveless and by using this point to back up the claim this kind of car would be a big waste of money because it doesn't fully serve it's purpose.

Last, but not least, if an accident were to happen would the blame go upon the manufacturer or the driver who was supposed to be assisting the wheel.

Although this idea of a driveless car is a good one and shoots for the sky, there is no way it could work out at the end of the day.

Too many points go into why driveless cars would not work rather than how they do.

Driveless cars are too expensive and dangerous to have exist, and people shouldn't rely on this kind of car because technology errors happen all the time while humans have the advantage of reaction time and common sense.

In conclusion, our roads would be safer if we kept human controlled cars.      ",3
a54cdd4,"The Facial Action Coding System, or better known as FACS, is a new technological advancement that can detect how a person is feeling. It holds promising applications for a variety of different things.

Prof. Thomas Huang collaborated with Prof. Nicu Sebe to innovate this technology. The Facial Action Coding System is a very complex.

It recognizes the muscles in the face and compares them to a neutral face; this is how the system can tell if you are feeling happy or sad. Eckman, the creator of FACS, organized six different emotions for the system to recognize. These feelings are, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The computer constructs a 3-D model of the face and identifies muscles such as, the orbicularis oris, which tightens your lips to show anger. This action is very similar to what we as humans do every day, except this is much more accurate.

I am for this technology becuase I think that it could help our students fully understand the material better. Every student learns differently, and that can make lessons more challenging for some more than others. The Facial Action Coding System could potentially modify the lesson to make it easier. I also think that this type of technology is important for students that have trouble focusing. The system could potentially make the lesson more exciting; this would possibly help the student focus better. It could also help the world of animation. Dr. Huang predicts that it could make computer-animated faces more expressive; this would be helpful for video surgery. FACS can do so much more for the technological world, making it useful in many different aspects.       ",3
c63d535,"The Facial Action Coding System can be helpful in many situations. However, a classroom setting would not be improved with this system. This system is an advanced technology that should be used in a more serious setting such as court trials and government activities. In a classroom setting, many children will not become interested in learning by changing the version of an online acitvity.

This software has many qualities that should be used in more complex situations. According to the article, this software can tell if someone is being honest and truthful. The software could be used to solve crimes between suspect instead of being persued in school work. This software will not change a child's opinion on a lesson because the software does not know the child's personal likings. Changing a virtual lesson does not change the fact that the student views it as work. If the software detects the student is becoming bored, changing the lesson may confuse the student.

Overall this software is extremely useful for certain situations, but a classroom setting is not in need of this software. Many students are tired throughout the school day and are attempting to finish a lesson. Changing the online lesson may become aggravating to an older student especially. The Facial Action Coding System may not be as accurate for a classroom setting. Many people show no emotion when attending class, which may allow the software to read the emotion as bored. Everyone has different facial expressions for each emotion. An intrigued student's lesson could be changed to a new version because the software found their facial expression to be bored.

Every student has a different outlook on school. Some come in ready to learn and others are trying to complete the day. If a student knew about this software and thought it could help them stay interested in their lesson, a teacher should allow them to experiment. Otherwise, if the student did not know about the software, this is an invasion of privacy. The Facial Action Coding System should be optional in a classroom setting, because many students would not be interested. A software can read the expression of a student, but can not change their perception of lessons or schooling. ",4
cd00112,"""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" article presents many aspects, both positive and negative, about these cars. Some of the positives are the cars are forseen to use half of the fuel today's cars use, offer more felxiblity than a bus, and people would not have to buy cars anymore. I personally believe that this is a bad and possibly dangerous idea. Driverless cars have no laws regarding them and are hard to decide who is liabe, and the cars are not very well devolped yet.

Firstly, the law aspect of Driverless Cars is majority of the time nonexistent. An exception to the pervious statement is that these cars are illegal even to test on roads in most state makeing it very obvious there has been little real-life testing. So no laws are in place to prepare for the new problems that will arise when these cars are actually in use and on the roads. If the technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault? Or if there is property damage? Should the car manufacturer or the driver be at blame for what happens? So many questions that will need to be answered and laws written for if these cars are ever use don the roads. But, I stand by the current laws which were written with the assumtpion that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.

Secondly, these cars have very little testing, and devolpment to become fully driverless. All of the current ""driverless"" cars still require a human for work zones, accidents, and even sometimes coplicated traffic. Sure, these cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves meaning they have the basics down. But, without an alert driver this could cause many accidents. Also since these cars are dependant on coding, computer chips, and sensors what if one of these systems fail will the car have a backup or human driving needed. Because the facts is so much can go wrong with technology why would someone want to put all of their trust into this technolgy. I think it is clear that human drivign should always be an option no matter how advance and well madee the car is it is not smart to put all of your trust into a machine without human assitance needed.

In the end despite all of the benifits and possiblities driverless cars provide it is not a good idea to put thes on the roads because of the lives these cars might put into danger. Even if they were fully safe their would be multiple questions concerning the law when these cars are concerned. It might be the conservative choice but, it is also the safe choice to say no to these new driverless cars. ",4
3a9bdb3,"Imagine being in a car, going to work, school, or out to eat, and not having to drive. Well many car manufacturing companies plan on releasing driverless cars in the future. While these cars are not completely driverless like they suggest, they rely on the driver only in certain situations. With these cars soon to be on the market, there are many benefits these have over regular, self-driven cars such as saved money, less reliance on the driver, and in-car entertainment systems.

A big part with any new technology, is the cost. With all these new sensors and gadgets placed on the cars, it is surely going to cost a good amount of money. However, in the long run, less accidents will be caused as these cars will know when to break and when to turn which can help save the money someone would need to repair their car.

These new cars will rely less on the driver altogether which will limit the amount of accidents as most of the accidents are due to human faults, not the car. With this new technology, the driver can sit back and let their car do most of the work, and then grab the wheel when alerted such as in a work zone or around other accidents. While the driver is waiting for their turn to drive they cannot simply just sit there and wait or they would get borded, so what would they do?

These smart cars are going to have in-car entertainment systems to keep the driver amused. When the driver needs to take over, these systems are simply turned off until it is the car's turn to drive again, something not available in phones while drivers are texting. So the driver could be watching there favorite movie or playing a game, when it is time for them to grab the wheel, it will temporarily shut off, and when they are done, they can continue watching or playing. So in a way these in-car systems are actually a safety feature in these new cars.

Some people will say that these new cars simply will not be possible due to the law. Most laws are written with the assumption that a car is being driven by a human and many states have it illegal to test computer-driven cars. However, if the states that do not have a ban on these cars test them, and they work, then other states will lift the ban and laws will be made to go along with the new cars.

New technology is produced everyday, and one day humans may not have to drive. If this is the case the benefits of this would include saved money, less reliance on a human, and in-car entertainment systems. So do not be surprised to go out on the road tomorrow and find people watching a movie and driving a car, as this new technology, is right around the corner.",4

Basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

390be02,"My position on driverless cars that there is a cause and effect to it. You can have postive effects and some bad effects such as having someone drunk in the car and they do something reckless in the car. But a good effect is that you can have someone avertise the car or use it in a good way. You have good reason that you can be having long dinstance driving and might take a nap if you get tired. then wake up and take control of the car. You might have the car for it's breaking system and not know that car that close to you and it can save someone life. But there somone bad effects like somone with out there driver liscense might get a smart car and get pulled over with them in it or have some thing bad happen to them.

Then you got the waitng on the law there might be some states that might not like the smart car and have people getting hurt and having it be the people that created the car problem. Such as california,Nevada,Florida,and the District of Columbia. they belive that you need somone with a licesnse to be driving the car so they baned it. They belive it be more reliably and safe.

I believe the use of tehcnology to read students expressions is valuable because as a studnt myslf i know how it feel to have to do a computer assignment and not get whats going on or its moving to fast so u get frustrated or angry .If they were able to put that in school computers i feel more kids will do better in school . Like if my facial exprassions are showing a teacher some they cant really get it because they are humans ad they cant really read faces s good as a computer could . Now on the other hand you have this computer that when i look confused it is willing to slow down or break things down more simplier for me and me only .

I feel sometimes thats all kids need is extra help because honestly im a student that needs extra help thats only a little bit of the reasons why i think that is valuable . Students facial expressions show everything you need to know you just have to get something to catch them . Of course they are going to have to make sure its spot on . What if i completely understanding everything and then they start to break it down then what ? Because tehcnology is not perfect .

That is a counter arguement someone can make . What if my facial expression is showing one thing but im feeling a different way . Technology always has a bug or something that nees to be fixed . So whoeer makes this needs to make sure that it is perfect .

These gases not only are warming the globe as a whole but are more locally effecting the quality of air in our cities. Efforts are being made to lower the amount of gases and improve air quality such as Car-free day in Colombia and bans on driving in Paris. For Colombia the city of Bogota has built bike roads and nice sidewalks to limit the need or want to drive and ultimitely reduce smog. During their last year millions of people walked on their car-free day even when it rained showing that people want to make a difference and positively help their enviroment.

In some areas like Paris where pollutants are at 147 micrograms per cubic meter drastic actions had to made during its peak on smog. The city of Paris put a partial ban on driving reducing the smog by 60 percent.

Some communities like Vauban, Germany have created car free suburbs and building lifestyle around that. Instead of large suburbs like we have here in the States they have focused on making shopping within walking distance. People of Vauban have been reported to being less stressed and more happy after living in a car free community. However; this is not the most practical here efforts can be made to redesign how we live such as making super markets easier to access on an everyday basis and only buying the groceries that you need for a couple of days instead of a week or two.

55be65c,"The limiting of usage a car has to stop because it destroy our country. How can cars destroy our country? Car can destroy our green house in many ways. one way if with all the components that the car have. For example, it can be destroy with the steam that the car throw out in the air(gas).Sometimes people can have  stress by having a car because they have to payed a lot, if a car doest'n work. They had to send the car to a place that can be fixed  and it can expand a lot of your money.

To begin with,sometimes car can be good for people that have there job far away of their home. But also car can cause you to have stress. for example in the source 3:car-free day is spinningn into  a big hit Bogota said that ""its a good opportunity to take away stress and lolwer air pollution"". This is true because if we not using a car, we don't have to worry to pay taxed, or to fixed the car. In my opinion if we just start to using car all the time, this is going to cause a big problem. Why cars can cause you a big problem on your daily life? Because cars can stop you to walk,can stop you to do a lot of things. You can get sick, one problem that United States has is the fat people. Why fat people? because they just start to use car and they doesn' t realize that if you use a lot the car, you forget that you have to do exersise or to walk. Well, is not just the car that can cause you to be fat, there are other stuff that can cause you to be fat. In the sources 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, said that ""that few  soccer moms or communiting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars"". They notice that cars can causing a lot of problems by paying a lot. Some people had to decide to gave up their car by walking to their jobs, or going to buy some food or just want to walk to be healthy.

Cars can be a limited for some people. If we just be a liltle thinker sometimes, we can notice that us, ""THE HUMAN"" we are destroyed our world with all the substances that the car hurl in the air. This world was make to protect us, but we just like to destroy the nature by the chemical that the car has, and other stuff that cause the world to be destroy. If you are an intelligent person you can stop this by don't having a car, and use your feet to get whatever you want to go.    ",3
3499b3e,"Driverless cars are one of the best ideas there could ever be for our future.

It would be a easier, more safe, and more reasonable for traveling in a car.

It has always been a want in sociaty. In paragraph two, ""Television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves."" People have been imagining this for years and have been pursuring the topic since the year 2009. Driverless cars may be a bit more to make and sell but they would save lots of money on gas, taxis, buses, ect. In paragraph three the passage talks about how people have been trying to do this for years, since the 1950's even!

Not only would it be what people want but it will eventually be what sociaty needs. For safer roads as the article says, we dont need safer drivers or safer cars but safer roads. With this being said, roads with only driverless cars would have very minium problems, accidents and what not.

This wouldn't be a so callled easy or quick prosses with getting these cars out on the road as soon as possile either, minor problems/faults with still occur. Monitoring these vehicles as they drives where ever is a smart thing because they can see how and why these errors happen, to be fixed.

In the article it talks about how people would still be able to drive these cars like normal if it is a desire. Here is where the idea wouldn't turn away people that like driving.

Driverless cars is again, one of the best ideas for our future. It is smart, safe, engery sufficiant, and logical way of transportation in the time ahead of us. Car manufactors have been and are pursuing this as it is, making it safer, smarter and better all around everyday. ",3
eee008f,"Cars are a very large help for transportation. Although they do have alot of defects to our environment, our laziness, and our safety.

The first reason we should limit car use is so our environment doesn't get ruined.  The fumes our vehicles are relasing into the air are creating a large addition to the greeenhouse gases.  For an example semis, diesel cars, diesel trucks and other vehicles when you rev the gas it pours out black smoke into the environment.  When you see a truck do this you think nothing of it, but overtime and with every single car and truck that does it, it adds up very quickley.

Another reason we should limit our car usuage is because it increases our laziness.  Instead of driving to school when it's only 2 minutes away, you could just walk.  If you walked you would lose a little weight and even saving your gas money.  If you are close to the place you want to go then you might as well just walk in benfits you in many ways.  Saving money, losing weight, and getting more fit.

One of the most important reasons we should limit our car usuage is for our own safety.  Deaths in car accidents is one of the most leading causes to death now a days. would you rather walk or ride a bike to the location you want to go or would you rather risk your life by driving and somebody teboning you and injuring or even killing you.  Not that you should but some people sometimes can get into a crash with you and then just drive off. Whether it was your fault or theirs now you have to pay for the damages done to your vehicle.

If you are going to drive because you live far away from everything.  Simply car pull, it's alot easier and if everyone throws down a little money then you aren't spending that much on gas or diesel.  Riding a bike is a great solution to limiting car usuage because it's a one time purchase, once you buy the bike you don't have to pay for fuel.  Also it's better than walking because it's by far faster.

In general driving has advantages and disadvantages.  Although if you are close to your location then riding a bike would be ideal to lower car usuage.    ",2
b9379d7,"Have you ever wanted a computer that can read your emotions ? Yes right? Me too. Its good to have a computer that can read your emotions because if its teaching a lesson in a boring way it can change it and make it a little more interesting. Second, it will detect your emotion and know what you like and what you don't like. Third, it will know when your happy or sad and it will know what to put on your screen.

First, it will change the mood of the lesson if you're getting bored. This is great because now the lessons won't be so boring and you will actually do them.

You will learn faster if you like the way they teach. In the text it say

"" ' A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, ' Dr. Huang predicts.' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor' ""

( paragraph 6, D'Alto). This states that if the student is getting confused or bored the computer can modify's the lesson and the lesson will be better.

Second, the computer will detect if you like or not like what you're watching. For example, if the video you're given isn't a good one and you really don't like it then the computer can change it and give you a better suggestion. Also, the computer will understand how some people only express with emotions. "" ' The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive - for video games or surgery. ' Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, ' notes Dr. Huang. ' So computers need to understand that, too "" (paragraph 6, D'Alto ). This explains how computer can undertand when you like something and also how they need to understand that most communication is used my emotios or expressions.

Third, it detects if you're happy or sad. If you're happy it will make sure to keep you like that but if you're sad it might play you something so you can cheer up and do your work. Its difficult to do your work when you're sad , when you're sad you don't even want to work. ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen,a similar add will follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different""(paragraph 6, D'Alto ). This supports my reason because it talks about how the computer knows when you're sad or happy.

In conlcusion, having a computer that can read your emotions wouldn't be bad to have in a classroom. I think they will make the classrooms a litltle bit better. First, because if the student is getting bored the computer can modify the lesson. Second, because it can detect what you do and don't like. Last, because it will detect when you're happy or sad. ",4
5976379,"Dear State Senator,

I disagree with the Electoral College and believe we, the voters, should be souly responsible for determining our President. The Electoral College is not fair to the citizens of our state. When we vote for something, we want our vote to determine our President, not determine who our electors will vote for.

When a member of their party votes, they may not always vote for that particular party's candidate. For instance, if the Democratic elect for 2016 had an aspect he planned to bring to Washington D.C., that a member of the Democratic party didn't agree with, they should be able to vote for whoever they please. Same goes for the electors, who may swing to the opposite party that particular year.

In the case of a tie, I do however agree that it should then be up to state senators to take into consideration both candidates and go over their key aspects. Then they can choice what will be most beneficial to our country and what will in the long run help our great state and country as well.

I do not think their should be swing states. I think that the exact votes of the citizens should be counted and go only on that. It should not matter the state or region the voter is in. Instead of voters supmitting a ballot at the local voting site, I think the voter should be able to vote online at a local voting center. In the past, voting has got miss-counted and I think that a more accurate means of voting would be to do it online. That way papers cannot get lost and a computer can count vote so human error does not occur.

I also highly agree with the statement from paragraph 23 that states, ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state..."" This is true with states particularly in the North who are made up of mostly Democratic and the South being mainly Republican. After the decisions made by the current president Obama, I think many Democratics will want to try something different after seeing all that has not been accomplished under Obama as of 2015.

I hope Senator, you will take into consideration my statement.

908dc9b,"Today I'm writing about The Challenge of Exploring Venus. Venus is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"". Its one of the brightest points of light in the sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from the sun. While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.

First, there's a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we expreinced on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liqefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather presnt additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

However, peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to out knowledge of Venus.

Last, NASA is working on other approches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important rolein the 1940s during World War 2. The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

Finally, I'm talking about all the things i talked about in my paragraphs. I talked about Venus and it's nickname, the amosphere percent, orbiting and hovering and then the NASA.",1
fffb49b,"In ""The Challenge of Exporing Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus is sometimes called the "" Evening Star"" this is in paragraph 1 the first sentence. Sometimes referred as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus because Venus is sometimes right around the the corner-in space terms-humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxixde blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the cloudds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and cloud have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit. this is why the author suggests that studying the ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",1
a635fc8,"Everyone has been faced with a challenge at least once in their lifetime.Whether it be a small or big challenge we always have to find a way arounf it.In the passge The Challenge of Exploring Venus scientists are curios at exploring venus despite being very dangerous for the information they can gain from earth´s twin.The author has a good claim on why they should continue to explore venus because we are going to have to face a challenge like venus in the future, it was just like earth, and it is the nearest planet for us to visit.

One of the many reasons we should continue to study venus it that it is the closet planet to earth in similarites.Venus was once inhabitated by oceans and all different lifeforms.¨Venus still has some features that are analogous to those of earth¨If scientists can understand how venus is what it is now from being filled with life forms to being dead and dangerous then we can use that to our advantage of earth and maybe stop it from happening to us.

Another good arguement that the author puts up is that scientists will most likely end up facing a challenge just like trying to explore venus.¨Also because human curiosity will likely to lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors¨.Despite venus being a hard challenge, scientists are coming up with new technology and have already made technology that can withstand the forces of venus.Venus is also a great lesson into what we know scientists can accomplish like if we were to get a full study of venus then if any other challenge just like it comes along we will be preprared in the sense that we already got experience.

One of the final really good arguements that the author uses is that we are in such a good position to explore another planet.¨Futhermore,recall that venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit¨The author is saying that we are lucky that we have such a close planet to study.Unlike saturn or neptune we do not have to spend so much money on fuel or time waiting for the satalites to get to the planet.We should take advantage of the fact that venus is so close to us even though it comes with more dangers.

Venus is like one big brick wall that if passed, can hold a lot of secreats that will help scients in the future understand how it was just like earth, how we can overcome even more challenges, and how we can study more planets using technology that we used on venus.",4

Now as you come to  mind this particular information is not only talking about coloubia is talking about the electoral collge also.According To Source Three ""And if an electoral tie seems unlikely,consider this:In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election;In 1976,a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way"".People should rethink about their desicions before they pick and choose.According to source three ""The Electoral Collge requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal.The  Electora is widely regarded as an anachronis, a non-democratic method of selecting a presiendt hat ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes.There are many diffent aspects of Electoral College.

Most importantly electoral college is that it can be understandable.It can be understandable by allowing people to knowing the method of electoral college.According to resource one ""Electoral College method is not democractic in a modern snese...it is the electors who elect the president not the president.

Source two states that Paris typically has more smog then other cities in Europe like Brussels and London. They're taking action by allowing even-numbered license plates to drive one day and have the odd-numbered license plates leave their cars at home and the same would apply to even-numbered plates the following day. Anyone against that restriction would be given a 22-euro fine or 31 dollar fine. That method decreased smog and congestion by 60 percent.

Source three talks about the country of Bogota, Columbia. This town or city has took a big step into reducing gas emisions where not only they participate but other local towns and cities as well. They contribute by leaving their cars home all day for one day to reduce the amount of carbon and smog in the air which helps the enviroment.

First, i say you should join this prgram because, you get to see people from different countries. You also get to expierence what its like to be on a cattle boat and meet new people that have joined the program as well. Maybe you might even get a special job on the cattle boat like being the look-out. You also get to be out on the beautiful sea.

Secondly, there are the opportunities of sight seeing, and exploring, you might also see ruins of places. Luke Bomberger got to go dight seeing a bit and see Venice,Italy while taking a gondola ride and the streets of the city were filled with water. You might even be able to go for a swim, now wont that be a splash.

It might be a long trip but it would be worth it. Its fun to explore and see new places so enjoy the opportunity while it lasts or just say yes and start your .

journey

Lastly, and most importantly, you would have to care for the animals. You would have to check on the animals every hour. You would aslo have to feed the animals, which are mostly horses and a few cattles. Tending to the animals is also an important job, you would hhave to care for them from one destination till the next, and it would be bad if they were sick since you didnt take care of them, but you should know it will be fun tho care for these animals, they are very gentle loving creatures.

9efb395,"Can you believe there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that can identify your emotion? I believe this system would be outstanding to use in a classroom because this system can look at a students face and determine their emotion. Just like any new system there are going to be advantages and disadvantages, so those need to be taken into consideration. In summary, I stongly believe that schools should begin using the Facial Action Coding System in school.

What is the Facial Action Coding Sysytem and how does it work? This system is a computer that builds a 3-D computer model of the face that you are testing. Then, the computer analyzes the face movement. For instance, when the muscle above the eye moves and

eyebrows are rasied the emotion is conveyed as suprised. Now, there are also many other emotions that the computer can read like happiness, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. In summary, this system is a process that works by analyzing a face and the face movements of a person to determine their emotion.

There are

many outstanding reasons why this program could be valuable for students in a classroom. First of all, this system can show how students are feeling. When a student is feeling sad or scared someone will know and they can help the student that is feeling those emotions. In addition, this program shows many emotions. For instance, a student will know when another student is happy, sad, suprised, angry, scared, or disgusted. Now, most of all classrooms have the shy students who are scared to talk, so by using this, the students teacher or other classmates can recognize the shy students emotion and help them through it. In wrap, students and teachers would be able to talk more easily about their emotions with one another by using this program.

Using the Facial Action Coding System could potentially be useless for students to use in schools. Many people aroud the world use different facial expressions for different emotions. By using this program, it could become inaccurate due to students not using similar expressions for each emotion. For example, some students don't smile as broadly as others so they may not be considered as happy as other students convey. Now, home PC's can't handle complex algorithms, so how is a teachers outdated PC going to handle this program? Many teachers still use PC's that are out of date and very ancient, so teachers won't be able to demonstrate how this emotion reading system opperates. In addition, students may also not be able to utilize this system becasue their PC might be unable to handle complicated algorthisms as well.

The Facial Action Coding System could become valuable to students in classrooms. Although the system has many disadvatages like reading an emotion inaccuratly; I strongly believe that this system could work wonders for students in classes everywhere. In summary, because of the ability to recognize many emotions, this program could become extremely valuable to students in classrooms all around the world.",4
f72239d,"Have you ever experienced a whirlwind of emotions during a dull class? It can truly be a difficult experience attempting to explain to your teacher that you need time out from class in order to orient your mind back onto the subject at hand. With a new technology developed called FACS, or Facial Action Coding System, conveying problems to a teacher isn't difficult when that teacher can already read their students' faces. This innovation, created by Prof. Thomas Huang, can detect the emotions of humans through psychology and 3D computer models that track all 44 major muslces in the human a human visage. In a classroom, The use of FACS is undeniably valuable because it can set apart a real smile from a fake smile, understand the basic human emotions need to be identified in a classroom setting, and it could provide an easier learning environment for students with social issues.

Setting apart a real smile versus a fake smile can provide value in the way a teacher interacts with their student. These feelings are understood with the help of psychology from Dr Paul Eckman. The FACS aparatus uses 6 basic human emotions that can inevitably seperate a real smile versus a fake smile. As it states in the article, ""These muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Therefore, in a classroom setting, differintiating real vs fake can be valuable when a student isn't being truthful about their dog eating their homework. It can also decrease the amount of anxiety a student recieves when asked if they understand a subject, in front of the class. If a teacher can understand their emotions, it would facilitate having to step aside with the student and talk about their difficulties on a particular subject. Understanding the difference between a faux emotion and a real one can make a difference in the realm of teaching, just as understanding the six basic emotions can too.

Using psychology, the teacher can also understand the six basic emotions needed to understand in a classroom setting. With the help of psychologist Dr Paul Eckman, the emotions read by FACS are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Happiness and surprise are emotions most of us can read, therefore its understanding through the FACS machine isn't vital to be understood. Other emotions like anger can be important though. Identifying anger on the face of a student can keep other students safe by isolating the student from the others, which in turn could keep everyone safe from a potential rage-induced tantrum. It can also help knowing berforehand if a student is sensing dangerous emotions such as anger, fear and/or sadness. According to paragraph 9, ""Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" If a teacher knows some of her students are feeling any of the three previous emotions, producing a happy environment could help keep the students happy or bring their emotions to a higher level of happiness. It therefore is valuable in that aspect and also to students thank can have issues with talking to their teacher.

Just as identifying dangerous emotions is important, so is identifying uncomfortable situations that can therefore be easier for socially anxious students. According to Dr. Huang, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" The former of those two emotions is vital to be identified because it can help teacher know when their students don't truly understand a lesson. Often, socially anxious students tend to keep their quesitons to themselves when they are confused about a topic out of fear of being juged as dumb or incompetent. They will go on without understanding which in turn can cause a decrease in their grades. If a teacher is able to read the true expression of their student, these type of situations can be avoided in order to create a better teaching experience for all the students.

In conclusion, FACS is without a doubt a valuable asset in a classroom environment because of its ability to identify real from fake, its understanding of the basic human emotions needed to be comprehended in a class, and because it facilitates learning for students with a fear of speaking.

In the future, seeing this innovation in a class setting would be an amazing feat for a step towards smarter teaching. With the help of Prof. Thomas Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman, a new future can be created. ",6
c1ed31f,"To all my fellow citizens, I must tell you about all the spectacular things cities are doing. They have started giving up their cars to decrease the congestion and pollution rate. The cities that have already tried it have seen a huge benifit.

A little community in  Vauban, Germany was the fist city to let go of their cars. Residents say they feel much less stress than when they had cars. What a suprise that not having to worry about traffic would reduce stress. It has also drastically reduced tailpipe emissions. They're have been rearangments by stores, they have been relocated along public sidewalks so that people no longer hae to drive across town to the mall or stores. They can simply walk or bike down the road to pick up whatever might interest them.

The next place that picked up this amazing wonderful idea was none other than the busiest city in France; Paris. Paris ordered its citizens to leave their car at home, and if they didn't comply would pay a 22-euro fine. 4000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to this fine, but if I was able to buy a car and not drive then I would be among those who would have their car impounded. On the bright side congestion went down 60% which is amazing for one of the busiest cities in the world.

The next place thats wanting to pick up this no car trend is none other than right here in the United States, and were supporting it. Each year that goes by recent studies have suggest that Americans aren't buying as many cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. If this pattern progresses it could solve our atomosphere problem. If huge cities and like Paris,Vauban,and The United States will give up cars. Than that alone could drastically change the path that our planet is headed for.

So citizens I hope this encourages you to cut back on your car usage. Take the bike out every once and a while or just walk. Whats the worst that could happen if you limited your automobile usage.    ",4

You could just bring the ""FACS"" Machinery and let that be the judge. We could also say that there are people who know how to hide emotions physically. So looking at them might let you think they are happy but really they are sad, lonely, depressed, ect. That would be another good momment for that to be there. To let you know how the person is really feeling.

There are both pros and cons to having this machine ill go over the pros first. Some pros are that you will be able to tell someones mood. Aswell as that you will be able to tell if someone is lying about there true feelings which could really be a problem when it comes to things like depression leading to suicides and things. Finally being able to know someones emotions could work to your favor as a teacher say someone is confused but to shy or scared to ask. Use the ""FACS"" machine to get them out of there. Some cons would be things like it could take priceless time out of your teaching to use the machine. They didnt give a estimate of how long it takes but i'd expect it to be a pretty long time. Also it could take a big price hit on the schools around the nation, I couldnt imagine this being a cheap device. Finally it could be useless. Some teachers wont take time out of their class to use it because frankly they just dont/wont care. Which would be a total bust seeing that the school would waste so much money just for it to go to waste.

I honestly think its amazing how someone can tell you how they are feeling at that moment. The diversity must be off the walls. it must be 1 in a million to get the same feeling. Its crazy the things we can do now a days with technology. People are coming up with more and more ways to initiate a more satisfactory lifestyle. Its always good to see someone take that inititive and start something like this. Seeing this I wonder what could be next. ",3

7f3ff0a,"There are many facts that lead me to believe why the ""Face on Mars"" is not an alien artifact and just a landform. There are many obvious facts that prove scientists at NASA right. According to the text, the face was found in an area where there are many landmasses, such as mesas. This led scientists to believe that the so called ""alien artifact"" is just another mesa, because of how common they are.

Another fact that led me to believe this, is that NASA would have no reason to lie to the public. If NASA had wanted to hide the fact that there are aliens, they wouldn't have released the photograph in the first place. NASA was made so that we could know more about space, why would they keep something important like aliens from us? NASA would actually benefit from having an ancient alien civilization on Mars.

According to the text, the first picture of the ""Face on Mars"" didn't have very good quality. Though most scientists didn't believe that it was some sort of artifact, many were curious. They took another picture, with better quality and released it to the public.

As they had suspected it was just another mesa, but of course, some people will always have doubts, even if the facts lead directly to the correct answer. These are some of the reasons why I believe that the ""Face on Mars"" is not an alien artifact, but a landform that coincidentally resembles a human face.       ",2
e0d01a8,"In this essay i will be explaining the difference and similarities and the pros and cons of the electoral college and opposing it. I personally like the idea of having the people themselves vote because the electors could change their mind and because it makes more sense to just vote for who you think should be president. As of right now i dont really care if it changes or not because i dont vote for another 4 years.

First, ""Whats wrong with electoral college"". one reason to pick electors is because its less people to keep count of. Having these electors is another step in the voting procces but it keeps things going easier. In conlusion, i dont agree with this, there is almost nothing i can think of that is good about this, unfortunutely.

Secondly, The great points of having the people themselves vote (which i agree with). One reason, is that electors can change their mind and vote for whoever they want and it could completely change the election. Secondly, This requires the president to go to all states exculding no one! This way all states feel equal and they feel like all of their votes matter. Another great reason is that they focus more on toss up states where people tend to pay more attention. Another good reason, is that bigger states get more attention. This is important because he can reach out to more people rather than a smaller state.

In conclusion, I think having people do the elections themselves is the better option. I hope you can come to agree with me.                                                       ",2

8138994,"Abolishing the Electoral College may be the best choice because the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the elecetoral college. Also at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.

If a tie occurs the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representating 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represents 35 million voters. Because of many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, The House's selection can hardly reflect the will of the people. For exapmple a tie would have occured in 1976 if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voter in Hawaii had voted the other way.

The electoral college can be unfair to voters because the winner-take-all syntem in each state, candidates fon't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning. For example during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

The elctoral college can have many good things but it still is not good enough for us to keep it. If the winner-tak-all systm didn't exist candidates would spend time in states even if they know they have no chance of winning, because they will not lose anything or maybe have at least a liitle chance of winning.

You can't believe anybody that has no real evidence. In paragraph five it says that ""evidence that NASA would rather have."" That shows that NASA doesn't want to say to anybody that is assuming that this is created by aliens because they really want this to be confidential. People thing the face is evidence of life on Mars and the Face is bona fide so they are saying there has to be life on Mars. In reality they don't know what they are saying so they are assuming that this was created by aliens just to start talk and give people something to talk about. This is evidence of why you can't believe anything without true evidence.

NASA won't even leak anything. Some people think that Face is bona fide and that shows there are aliens on Mars. Nobody knows is that is true because if you read the paragraph it says some people think and everyone is believing what people think. THe story has been around for about the Face on Mars and it's bween everywhere for about 25 years and after a while of the story people started to say things that are not real mixed in with real things and people have just been going around like that. This is evidence of why NASA won't leak anything so people do not know the truth.

If NASA won't leak anything then everyone is just assumimg. ""The Face on Mars has starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years."" It has been in movies okay and they change it up a little bit to make it interesting and people think that is the true story. NASA wishes there was ancient civilization background on Mars so they know the full details. NASA doesn't even know the full story of the The Face, so how can people be for sure about anything. These are examples of why people are just assuming.

People think it is a face that aliens put on there. So you are saying if I go out to the middle of the desert and see a face it camre from aliens. It is a natural landmark that came with the planet of Mars. NASA is not even telling people so no one even knows for sure anyways.

You can't believe anybody that has no evidence, NASA won't even leak anything, and if NASA will not tell anybody anything then everyone is just assuming. This is why this is just a landmark.

e76990c,"To start off, I think the technology to read emotional espressions of students is vulnerable because in todays society not a lot of people are great at socializing, their faces and actions speak louder than theirown words. Basically saying that students and teachers should know somethng is wrong with the person just by looking at their face and the expressions they're portraying.

In the article it states that the peoples faces don't lie and that this is a pro because it helps detect wheather a person is lying or not. On paragrapgh #8 it sites ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Clearly, right there it states that we could know wheather a big person we look up towards to like our president could be lying to us or not just by simply using this advance computer technology to recognize human facial expressions. This is also a gret opportunity for humans and computers to develop better ways to communiacte. It's a great big step forward in society too. If you're not great at expressing how you feel verbally maybe you're better just facialy expressing it without saying a single word. This amamzing technology can even identify mixed emotions. In the article it staes that ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery. Most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" says Dr. Huang. This means your computer could know how you feel without saying a single wrord. I also think this an advanatge to school consuelors because students sometime have trouble in school and don't really like to talk about their feelings.

To conclude, I think the technology to read emotionals expressions should be vulnerable to students and the teachers as well. Why? Becasuse a lot of people can struggle with anxiety/social problems and they just need somepone to talk to but just don't know how. This is why computer science is helpful to when it comes to situations like this. ",3
b9d893c,"Technology has advanced enough for a computer to recognize a person's emotions just by watching their facial features, one such invention is the Facial Action Coding System. If that is the only way to recognize a person's true feeling then one might as well use their own eyes. Of course, our eyes are not always inept to specific details, which a computer will help advance, but if recognizing a one's emotions in the classroom is important, one should just learn the specifics of reading emotions to surely understand what a student is feeling.

If one's emotions in the class room are plainly obvious to a computer, then they should be easily recognizable by the teacher. The passage states, ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even thorugh individuals ofter show varying degrees of expressions."" With that in mind, students should show a clear expression, such as when one is bored or confused, that is recognizeable to everyone around them, including the teacher, making the the Facial Action Coding System an irrelevance.

The Facial Action Coding system may also be flawed when recognizing emotionaless expressions. When analyzing a person's facial expression, ""each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" Which means that the computer will not be able to read a person's emotions if they hold a straight face. In this case, the recognization ablilities of a computer is unnecessary, for in order to recognize that individual's emotions, another person must know how that individual expresses their emotions such as their actions or words. However, the passage states that ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" In other words, the Facial Action Coding System is helpful when our eyes fail to decifer a stranger's emotions. On the contrary, in a classroom, a teacher should gradually and instincively, learn to recognize the emotions of his or her students without the use of a computer.

Recognizing a student's emotions cannot be solved due to the development of facial recognition systems, such as the Facial Action Coding System. In order to read a student's emotion, it is necessary to understand the student's personal expressions or actions that come from certain emotions. Although a computer can recognize these expressions, it cannot not always be useful if one's expression contradicts the normal facial expression, or an expression is not even shown on their face. Nevertheless, it is not necessary to use a computer to recognize a person's emotions, for it takes a person to know a person, even without a computer. ",4
fd08fc3,"The Facual Coding System enabling identification of human emotions.

I agree with an idea that it's valuable to use thi technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.""This means that when a student is not feeling well at all the classroom computer could let the teacher know and and the teacher can find solutions to the student. This can help both a teacher and a student because the teacher can know when the student(s) is ready to learn and can contribute to the academic performance.

""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""This means that the classroom computer is something very important becase students can understand the lesson which is benefitial.

""The classroom computer could also read when students are stressed/no concetrating."" The classroom computer can let the teacher help student get out of stressors. This is the moost important to students because can contribute to the future of student by identifying whoever needs help.

""Prolonged sadness for some students."" The Classroom computer can help student in many ways, some student can't identify their feelings or emotions. Depression is something that can harm people mentally and some students including me don't we don't want other people/teacher know what's going on in ours life. So the classroom computer can identify us and notify the teacher which can help us get help.

Therefore the classroom computer is something to consider in schools or classrooms. It's helpful to both teacher and a student. ",3

The author supports his idea of exploring venus by giving reasons on why it is good to explore it and by giving reasons on how hard it is to explore venus without good use of technology and understandment on the planet,in paragraph two the author explains on how no spacecraft has survived on venus for more then a few hours, on paragraph four the author explains that ""if our sister planet is inhospitable...why do scientists discuss further visits to its surface...Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it once have been the most earth like planet in our sloar system."" this is an explination on that exploring venus is dangerous but it may help us learn more about if there was another earth before us.

In the text the author claims that venus could have been a earth-like planet of the solar system long ago reaserchers or scientists and astronomers are fascinated by venus and wanting to explore venus do to the fact that it seems there was human life in venus long ago, in paragraph four the author explains that ""Long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life."" this is and example of what scientists would like to explore about venus to discover or learn that it could be possible that venus was once earth before ours.

Throughout the whole article the author explains and gives many reasons on why exploring venus is a good idea on the fact that we could learn from it, The author also states on how venus is dangerous to explore because we dont have the right technology to be save enough to land on it. even though venus is every dangerous to go to and explore with the right technology we could learn things we have not discovered about our planet, exploring a planet that could have been like ours a long time ago could give us many more things to learn about and discover.",4
f7d2207,"According to the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" companies have been working on cars that need less human control; earning these cars the moniker ""driverless."" In my opinion I am against the development and distribution of these vehicles. Having driverless cars would,promote the lazy characterists of drivers, be hazardous on the roads, and expensive to produce. These cars should not be at the top of companies developmental lists.

A driverless car isn't really new to the world, as the article states ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" If the idea of driverless cars isn't scary enough, add to the equation the idea that it is under ""specific conditions"". When would be the ideal time that someone would need to switch a car to autopilot? The production of these cars will make drivers lazy. Many car accidents are at the fault of a driver not paying attention, and add a person behind the wheel of a ""smart car,""

or a car that can drive itself and that number will multiply. We can't let people get comfortable with the idea that a car will prevent them from having accidents.

The production of smart cars could also be hazardous on the roads, the article states that "" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" These ""sensors,"" or danger detecting devices and other computerized appliances that help these cars function, may not always be reliable. What could happen if they weren't properly installed and malfunction? To many cars today that aren't smart cars get called back to factories for complications, adding more fancy attractions is a lousy idea.

Another reason why the production of these cars is a horrible idea is money. The very same reason why the production of the ""Smart- road systems,"" did not work out. How much of our tax dollars are going into this industry? This is money that we don't have to be waisting on an advancement that is not needed. This new breed of car is going to do nothing for the economic standing of the world. Companies are producing these cars at our expense and then not making them available to the average person. Companies like,"" Merceds-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" Then who are they going to market them to? The people of the upper class will be the only ones with smart cars in their possession.

In conclusion, I believe that the production and distribution of smart cars is an aweful idea. Having driverless cars would,promote the lazy characterists of drivers, be hazardous on the roads, and expensive to produce. The number of accidents would increase, technology is completely unpredictable, and we simply do not have a firm economical standing to be producing these vehicles. I believe that we should be using this money to improve other, more important things, like the educational systems.  ",5

I think that Electoral College is a great and fast way to gather up votes to pick on our new president but i think that it has some big issues and the neagtives overcome the positives. One of the great things Electoral College brings that it is widely regarded as anarchronism with means that the votes wont be ""overruled"" it would acutally be the maguraty of the people voting on the president. If not it would be the elctors who elect the president, not the people. Also the party the people select is highly trusted and rarely betrayed. There have been a lot of cases in the past that go against Electoral College. One of the things that i am against the electoral college is that the voters dont actually vote on the presidental runner up they are actually voting on the state electors that who in turn elect the president. Also most worrying is in the case of a tie in the electrical vote. In that special case the elctection would actually have to go to the House of Representatives which means that state delegations vote on the president and The Senate would choose the vice-president. Basically the Electoral College is unfair to voters cause of the winner takes it all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning so they only focus on the tight ""swing"" states. Its official in my opinion that the Electoral College  is unfair , outdated , lack of democratic pedigree and irrational. It has lack of reasons in favor. I think we should just get over with this and go old school and get done with all this confusing matter and change to election to popular votes it took more of time but it was more accurate and caused less problems.

In German Susburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , writen by Elisabeth Rosental, She tells her readers that a suburb in Germany, Vauban, has street parking, driveways, and home garages generally forbidden. Rosenthal states that not having a car can actually bring happiness. ""'When I had a car I was always tence. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walker.""

In the second article,

Paris bans dring do to smog , by Robert duffer, he tells the reader about the struggles Paris faced with polution in the air. He states that they made a system where one day they would have even licence plate number stay home one day and the odds would stay home the next. After trial and error, They came up with a solution, And it helped the smog go away. If cars were banned completly the air we breathe would be so much cleaner, and less foggy. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescrind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.""

In the third passage

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , by Andrew Selsky, It talks about a car free day that takes place once a year in the town on Bogota. The passage also states that people hiked, biked, skated, and took buses to work during the car free day. Selsky states that the goal of the day is to promote alternative transportation and reduse smog, Which brings back the fact that not using cars reduses polution in the ait. The other reson banning cars is a good idea is because it redused stess, because you dont have to deal with traffic, find a parking spot, or worry about being late to work because you have to stop to fill up your tank in the morning. ""'It's a good oppotunity to take away stress...' said buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza""

The last article the End of Care Culture , written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, talks about how ""americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". i beleive people are finally coming to the state of mind where public transportation is the faster, easier, and more afisiant way. Another reason it is better than having your own cars is that it is safer. ""'...public transpotation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resousrces, lower emissions and improve safety.""

The main advantages of limiting car usages are happiness, lower in polution, lower in stress, and increase in safety.    ",3
84b0be6,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage.  A few of these examples are that it is better for the environment because it reduces greenhouse gasses and causes less polution and smog.  Another advantage is car traveling is becoming less nessasary because of citys like New York and new and improved telecommuting methods.  Also, car usage is becoming less popular, this is because of ""no car days"" and people just not bothering to get a car or a license.

To begin with, when you limit car usage, it is better for the environment because off all the greenhouse gas reduction caused by not using as many cars and other gas producing vehicles as much.  For example, in source 1, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states that "" And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes....passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"".  50 percent is a large number to be taken up by cars alone, if we can reduce car reduction, we can reduce greenhouse gasses.  Another example of why car reduction is an advantage is because of the pollution and smog areas.  You can clearly see this being stated in source 2, by Robert Duffer, ""[The smog] rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.""  If Bejing, were to do what Paris did, they too could reduce smog and pollution by car reduction.  Also, in Bogota, Columbia, they have no car days, to limit the amount of smog.  However, limiting car usage to better the environment is not the only reason of why it is an advantage.

Secondly, one other advantage of car reduction is because it is becoming less nessasary to own a car.  For example, as stated in source 4, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, New York, is starting several programs to use cars less, including car-sharing, skyrocket bridge, tunnel tolls, and bike sharing programs.  In that source, it also says that when someone stops using a car, for whatever reason, they find it unnesasary to continue using cars, mostly because some citys are becoming more centralized again, and it's becoming easier to walk to stores.  However, thats not the only reason that it's being less nessasary to own a car. Another reason is because of improved telecommuting methods.  In source 4, Mimi sheller is quoted while talking about how people don't feel the need to drive to see their friend, instead they use their phone or computer to communicate.  Another reason for limiting car usage is because it is becoming less popular.

Thirdly, a lot of citys are starting to have car free days, this is shown in source 3, by Andrew Selsky.  In cities like Bogota, Cali, and Valledupar, all in Columbia, they have ""Day without cars"" this is one example of cars becoming less popular because, even though it was raining, tons of people still participated.  Another example is in source 4, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she says that her children, both of age to get a license and living where one might want a license, still have not gotten there license because they do not think it is nessasary, and they simply stay where they can walk, or ride bikes, or take the bus, or the subway.  Mr. Sivak has shown that the number of 16 to 39 year olds that have a license has significantly reduced.

In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car usage including it is better for the environment, it is becoming less nessasary, and it is also becoming less popular.    ",3

But like I said in the previous paragraph they would feel more safe if they where able to control on their own as well as wanting to take breaks here and there.

""Within 10 years sensors have become more advanced to detect ands respond to danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. the sensors can apply breakes on individual wheels and reduce power from an engine allowing far better response and control than a human drive ever could."" quoted Google Cofounder Sergey. There could be serious monfunctions, we cant predict that cant happen. So i think it would be safer if we had the ability to choose to drive or not.

But in a way this could really help us out in the future, say that a driver is not paying attention to the road and they are about to hit a deer.. a sensor could very well come in handy to keeping anyone in the car safe and it also can prevent damage to the car. In other wods this could go either way it could be good but also have some concerns.

So in conclusion i belive that if we keep working at the technology we could very well have a success at driverless cars, but untill then i think we should really think out the pros and cons of this situation before we advance to the next step. This could very well be and amazing break through but also could lead us in to some complications, so in other words i belive that we should have thwe choice to drive and be able to have this advantage to be able to have this as an easy safe thing.

d5d0945,"I think driverless cars could be very helpful and useful at times. There is many different positives and negatives on this subject and they are worth looking in to. I honestly dont think this is the safest way to go because computers can easily malfunction.

In paragraph 7, they mention that the driver needs to stay alert in traffic jams and scenerios that need human skill. I feel like people wouldn't be as alert if the car was doing all of the work. If people were in full control at all times, then i think there would never be a need to slack.

Driverless cars could be easier but I just can't see it being safe anytime soon. I personally feel like this invention would be more fun than safe and a part of me feels like way more accidents will occur with driverless vehicles. If they do release this car, I will just stick to a regular honda or something simple.",2
e123359,"Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers? The author of the ''The Challenge for Exploring Venus''

supporting his idea very detail and well by descriping and comparing with others planet and how challenging it is.

First,he talked about how the Venus looks interesting and challenging, in the text its state that, ""Venus is simple to see from the distance but safe vantage point on Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely"", also said its not an easy condition but survivable for human and also Venus is the closest planet to earth. But even though he said that he also state how, is state '' NASA is working and finding the best machanical and computer for to last longer in Venus and helpful to use.

Second, the author also state which is very well to support his idea it said, '' A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more Challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venuss atmosphere''. which means that the Venus temperature and atmospheric is grater compare to our planet. He even state '' beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its suface"".

And

at the third, the author questioning to support his suggestion; ''why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?'' also he answer '' Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system''.

The statement prove that,he support his idea with details and well. The challenge must be not easy but as he said there's some people who is finding the solution and how to get better to prevent our world.             ",3
63f5f7f,"limiting how much the car is used could reduce the green house gas emissions, smog would reduce, and in germany, it will save money.

to begin with, green house gas emissions are produced by cars being used and the carbon dioxide is not leaving the atmosphere. when the sun shines light into earth's atmosphere, the heat from the light rays can not escape the atmosphere because of all the carbon dioxide. this causes problems in the polar regions. due to the increasing temoatures, the ice is melting more and quicker. this causes sea levels to rise and in teh antartica region, animals can not cross the ice fast enough to get to where their food is leaving them stranded to starve. if the usage of cars was reduced, the green house effect wouldn't affect people or animals as much.

In paris , cars are being banned due to too much smog in the area. ""after five-days of intensiving smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, chins, which is known as the most polluted cities in the world. cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions."" it can also make it difficult to breathe.

the sorce ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" talks about how in Vauban, Germany 70 percent of families do not own cars. the cause of this is because of how much it cost to own a car. One has to pay $40,000 with the cost of their house to park in a parking garage. it is cheaper to just pay for public transportation or walk. not only is it cheaper, but it reduces the green house effect.

7655f0b,"In the atricle, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it addresses the idea of driverless cars. I believe that humans should stay in control of the road, it has worked this far, why can't it continue working? For one, it is not equipped with the common since of a human, it cannot fuction with tough traffic mishaps. Secondly, the computers may malfuction, and they could cause a lot of damage.

There are a lot of issues with this car, firstly it has trouble dealing with complicated traffic issues, as seen in paragraph two. What if someone was driving on the interstate and fell asleep because the car was driving and the driver wasn't alerted going through roadwork? If someone died the driver would be responsible for the death. Or what if there was an accident? The car would keep going and bust through it, and it would be the drivers fault.

Another reason why it shouldn't be open to the public is because no computer is one hundred percent perfect. Computers always malfunction, they need to reboot sometimes, and othertimes they just quit working. I have been working on projects for English 10 before and my computer just shut off and I lost my whole project. It could happen with this, the car could reboot, or the computers could shut off and the driver could be asleep, and it shuts off. Causing a huge accident. How is this a good idea?

All in all, I would say that this isn't such a great idea. In the examples of not being able to deal with complicated traffic issues, and the computers malfuctioning, it just isn't a great idea. I believe humans should stay in control of the roads, it has worked this far, why can't it continue working?       ",3
2515e4d,"In the excerpt the author talks about how even though going to venus will be a challenging journey it will aslo be a meaningful one. Through paragraphs 1-8 he paints a perfect picture of what NASA's has tried to do and what they are currently doing. He starts by explaining that yes, the living conditons on Venus are not ideal but they are survivable. Through the previous voyages to Venus, they have been able to establish that Venus is not a stable enough planet for them to completely land advanced technology there yet. The author tells us that in the past NASA has sent rovers and stuff up to the surface of Venus to get us a better view of our galaxies ""evening star''.

But within hours the space craft was lost and in a way killed due to the harsh conditions on Venus. Taking all that into consideration, NASA is planning on devising a better plan to rediscover and reexplore Venus. They are brainstorming on a way to make a device that can hover 30 or so miles above the surface of Venus. That distance will be the equivalant to jets and commercial airplanes flying over storms here on earth. The author succesfully persuaded me to believe Venus is worth exploring after reading this excerpt.

He did so by descriptively creating a scene in my head of Venus being Earth's equal. He talks about there being valleys, hills, and craters on Venus's surface just like they are here on Earth. He also goes into detail about how there is a strong possability that long ago Venus could have been covered in water that could have supported various life. There is also a strong possibility that if Venus can support our earth needs, then it could possibly be supporting someone elses. With further research and explorations we could find out if there truly is other life forms other than us.

In conclusion, Venus is worth going back to and doing a deeper investigation of what the planet really can do. I do believe that if anything would happen to earth it would be in our best bet to be able to flee to Venus. The author did a amazing job of supporting the idea of conducting better research on Venus by painting a vivid image into my head. Through his use of words and use of back story, he helps show that with enough motivation and dedication. We can transform Venus and its rough planetary conditons into another Earth.",4

7e06b0b,"To the senator of our state,

The electoral college makes a big impact on our voting system. However, it needs to be changed or even abolished. The manner in which the eletoral college funtions is not fair to the public. By the time you've finished this letter I hope you'll have taken my suggestion to mind.

For one the electoral college makes voting feel unvalidated. It should be the public themselves that choose the president, not a signifigantly smaller group of people. This was the case in the 2000 election, when Al Gore was not elected even though he had a popular vote of 60 percent. This gives many people the mindset that if their votes will be overuled by the electoral college, then that gives them less of a motivation to vote.

This brings us to my next point. If the electoral college is abolished, than more people will want to vote. Now, the public's opinion is just as important as the college's in our current system, but there would most deffinately be a increase in the number of votes if this system was deystroyed. What drives people to vote in the first place is that they want their opinion to be heard, so the electoral college is preventing their opinions from being heard.

Another reason to abolish the electoral college is that I don't think that many people know it exists in the first place or at the very least know how it works. If more people were given the explanation from these articles, they would probably feel the same way; that their votes no longer mean anything by the time election day comes.

To conclude, the electoral college is an outdated concept in our federal system. It should be abolished so that the public will have a greater sense of purpose when they vote. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read my suggestion.    ",3
cc2453a,"my postion on this is that its honestly the stupidest thing i have ever heard of.I mean honestly in todays world you literally have a computer to do everything for you wich is called lazyness. Me personally i think we should keep it the same with cars just make them safer because not one time in this article did i hear anything about the safety rating or their capability of not having a malfunction while driving.

I think that if we have driverless cars we would be focused on the wrong things while the car is driving like putting our nose right in to social media and when those sensors go off we wont be able to react in time. In this part of the story paragraph 9 it clearly states that their is laws in some states and if you ask me i say it should stay that way because these ""cars of the future"" are stupid and it honestly makes me livid that they could be so dumb as to come up with this idea.

these manufactures have no file or proof that these will be the safest choice honestly i think people need to stop being little babies and grow a pair and take life by the nads and get the ball rolling on learning how to drive they need to know how to appreciate the car before they say they want driverless cars america is about tradition you dont change tradition.

Honestly me myself i OTHER_PII for a living and i love nothing more than going fast and being free and in control how do you think someone like me would feel if you took that freedom away by having a car limit its self to 25mph thats like a smack in the face to me because when i drive on the road i want to be incontrol of my actions and what i do point blank.

Also did they even take into consideration some of our income we get by the time i would by a driverless car i could have had my dream car and then some i mean these people are just assuming that we have 60,000-1,000,000 dollars just laying around.",3

Even though the Electoral College is a good way of selecting a president. This meathot has his flaws, under the electoral college system the people that vote are not voating for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. And I think that the people that vote shude vote directly for the candidate they have chousen.

This makes more sense that voting for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledge to the candidate.

I think at the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. Since the voter are not voting directly for their candidate of choise, I personaly dont think this is the best way to go. The popula elections provide a better way of voting for president. Since it means that the people that vote a voating directly to the candidarte and not the electors. The popular elections is a safer an more fair way to vote. By thid we could evate the disaster factor, for example the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century and the system allows for much worse.

83f3a78,"In this article, the author talks abut driverless car and the benfits and problems with them. The author says his veiw and the veiw others may have on the driverless car. I am going to point out some of the aadvantages and disadvantages of owning a driverless car.

The benfits of a driverless car is that you dont have to drive as much only on certain things I mean thats obvious. You can text or call when driving and not have to worry about wrecking because your car by the hit of a button will drive for you, then when your done texting you hit the button and now your in contorl of the car. This is also a good advantage for people who cant see very well but still well enough to drive but it really strains their eyes.

You might be thinking okay those are ther advantages so what are the disadvantages well I'll tell you. A disavantage of a driverless car is that they cant do everything there is still things the operator has to do like back out of driveways or pull out of driveways or drive in traffic. Also the car could mess up go haywire or something and cause a wreck, and that wouldnt look good on the business. While a driverless car isn't fully a bad idea and is worth a shot at trying, some dont agree and some states even banded it, they wont even test a driverless car. You see that there are alot of good advantages and some disadvantages but sometimes you just have to try take the risk and see what happens. My opinion on driverless car is that they are good idea but i think they still need alot of work to fix bugs and work out all the ckinks in them.

Overall, I believe driverless cars are not a bad thing once properly fixed and everything is near perfect, and they work out the ckinks they are worth a try. Its going to take them awhile to fix everything on a driverless car before they are ever sold, if they are ever sold. it could take 10 to 20 years before they are ever on the market. But when they do start to sale people should definetly give them a try.",2

Cars use up a lot of gas, which means more money you have to spend. There are a lot of people that hate to spend so much money on gas, and it is their choice to drive all around town. It's their money that they're spending. Paris baned driving due to smog. If they catch you driving with an even numbered license plate, then you have to suffer a 22-euro fine.

afe183e,"Making new discoveries can be hard at times. Especially if there are a lot of obsticles that are in the way, it can be quite difficult. We have an entire universe to discover, such as planets that can be further looked into. The planet Earth has two planets that are very close at times. One of which we already have looked far into so why not look into the second planet that is closest, Venus.

Venus is a planet that we are able to see from Earth, even if some of us aren't professional stargazers. This planet is very close to us at times and is why it can be somewhat easy for us to see. From what we have been able to see from this planet, is that Venus is a, ""cloud draped world."" As we have looked father into it, NASA can tell that there are mountains, valleys, craters, and also has rocky sediment. The look of Venus has similar things as Earth does. The way that Venus looks, it seems that it would a cool and different place to live.

With every good thing comes a bad thing. Venus looks like it would be a good place to live but also has some flaws. The spacecrafts that have gone have been unmaned. It's good that they were because Venus gets very hot. Although Mercury is closer to the sun, Venus still gets hotter. The reasoning for this is because of all the gasses that are surrounding it.

Having another planet that we could be able to go to would be extrordinary. With technology always evolving, I have no doubt that we will be able to visit Venus one of these days. Since we are always evolving, we could find ways of being able to go to Venus despite the dangers. If NASA has been able to go to Mars, then in a matter of no time we should be able to go to Venus. Venus could be the second Earth, we are twins in terms of density and size.

I think that what the author was stating in the passage could really be put to use. Even though there might be a few flaws along the way, I think that we would be able to go to Venus if we kept persuing it. If NASA is always looking into new ways of spacecrafts going to Venus, they could find a way for the spacecraft to safely go there. After that then they could look into more things on Venus and make new discoveries. Venus would be a great idea to keep persuing.",3

27065ce,"The Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, could be useful for school purposes, and may help students and teachers tremendously. On the otherhand, however, it is not perfect and may cause more issues than it solves.

For school purposes, the FACS can be used to alter an online course, assessment, or even just a simple knowledge check, using facial expressions to determine if the students are confused, bored, or if they understand it. If they are confused, it may be altered to help them understand whatever it is they're working on. For someone who is bored, it may try to make an online course more interesting to grasp their attention.

However, the FACS is not perfect. It may mistake a facial expression for the wrong emotion. This could result in issues involving altering an online assessment, or course. Some students may feign emotions, and make faces to do the easier course that's meant for students who require additional help. Also, students who take an online course may be confused about something else, not the course they're taking. The FACS will still read that expression as confusion and alter it because of that confusion.

Altogether, I feel that these cons outweigh the pros too much, and I believe that the FACS should not be used for purposes such as an online course or assessment. Too much may go wrong too easily with the use of FACS.",3

The ability for a machine to stay intact in this condition would result in the capability of exploring the bottom of the ocean.

The author also conveys that learning about Venus' Earth-like features could give man a better estimate of how Venus' change came about. In paragraph 4,""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported carious forms of life, just like Earth."" Having this knowledge supplies scientists with knowing what lived on Venus or what happened to the life. in paragraph 6,"" More imortantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" The fact that researchers can't easily take materials from the planet shows that if we can collect things from this dangerous planet we can do to the rest of the planets.

Finally, studying our ""twin"" planet would be one of the greatest challenges for mankind. In paragraph 4,""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"" There are risks with going back to Venus, but the chance of information

widely outweighs the risks. In paragraph 8,""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally imtimidating endeavors."" The task of studying a very dangerous planet could lead to itch of science to do even greater tougher tasks.

The author strongly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author gave evidence to support that studying the present Venus could help understand past Venus and furture Earth. the evidence also strengthens that overcoming this challenge will aid further exploration of Earth and space.",4
832611d,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy can be very hard, but it can also be super fun I enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy, and there are lots of reasons why. I think it is a great idea to participate in this program. Here are a few reasons why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

One of the best parts of participating in this program is visiting lots of new places. I was a small town boy and it was very interesting to get to go to all of these places. One of the places I went was Venice, Italy. I also got the opportunity to go to Greece and see the Acropolis.

Another great part of participating in the program is that you can make lots of new friends. On the return trips I played lots of games with the other cowboys. This helped me make lots of friends. Some of the games we played were baseball, volleyball, and table-tennis.

A very important part on participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program was helping countries that needed help. Lots of countries were tring to recover from World War 2. It was very rewarding to know that this is helping lots of people. It is also good to know that you are the ones helping and you know that these countries are getting what they need.

I think it is a very good idea to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. It is rewarding, fun, and takes you places you would never think you could go to. Joining this program is a very great thing to do.          ",3
27295aa,"Driverless cars and how I feel about them. Well I think they would be helpful and dangerous. The help would come from providing parents access to attend to their child while getting to where they need to go. Also for people who handle a lot of business, and students. The danger is not all things are promised o function correctly, anything could happen.

Parents: sometimes while driving with kids can be a handfull. Babies cry and scream needing a bottle or a change of a diaper, or sometimes comfort. With driverless cars that could help. Parents wuld be able to attend their child while still going wherever that it is their going. Sometimes driving with kids you have to be careful with the speed you're going because when you have to stop abruptly its possible for the car to jerk and your kids will fly out the windshield. With driverless cars they have better brakes and sensors for the car to stop when they detect something is coming or if you go without it being your turn.

People who have businesses can have a hassle trying to have meetings with clients or board meetings with shareholders over the phone while driving. That can not only lead to a dangerous accident but can result in you having a ticket. Driverless cars would improve that because not only could people get on the phone and look around for papers and send emails but they can still be in motion in their cars.

As for the students, they have homework almost everyday, and trying to get to school everyday knowing that you didnt finish some of that homework is definitely something to make you cranky. With driverless cars you will be able to finish up the exra work you forgot and also be on your way to school. I know that would love to invest in this car for that very reason.

The dangerous part is not every machiene operates correctly. there's something that can always go wrong relying on technology, especially new technology. So in conclusion this why im both with and against driverless cars. I believe over time my opinion would change to being completely for driverless cars.",3
b0ee7b5,"I think that the face on mars was made simply by nature and I think that it couldn't have been made by aliens. The reason that the face was made is just by lava that has made it into that form. The shape it is in is just a coincidince and it is truly one of a kind.

The alien's markings were not there we proved that when Michael Malin and his ""Mars Orbiter Camera"" snapped a photo 10 times sharper and it was proven that the face was not an alien made feature but instead a landform beautifully to be there from nature.

Aliens couldn't have made this landform or we would've seen them in a camera that we set in space to take pictures of planets like Space Orbiters. When we saw the landform we immediatley took a picture of it. We had to roll the space craft 25 degrees to center the face in the feild of view. We took a photo as soon as we could get a good shot at it.

In conclusion, this landform couldn't have been made by aliens because there is no alien's markings and there isn't even any proof that it could have been alien's makings. This landform is made completely by nature and it is a very neat attraction and we should admire it but remember that it wasn't made by aliens.    ",3
153aa37,"Well first if i go back to paragraph 3 Nasa states that they thought from sending the pictures to the pubic it be a good way to atract public attention to fund mar's missions.

""The face"" became very popular when Nasa first sent it to the public. Also on paragraph 7 the author states that when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia ,they found out that ""the face"" was just a regular natural landform. In the year of 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor was able to snap a picture of the landform, as said by Garvin

""the picture actually showed the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa- landforms common around the American West"". I don't think the landform is an ancient artifact or any alian artifact i just think its a normal landform that happens to look like a human or alian face. Even if Nasa was lying to us the landform benefits Nasa. When they first snapped the photograph and shared it with the public it received alot of public attention. Many people funded the missions to snap more photographs of the landform to get a better look at it. It was basically was a waste of time and money because it ended up being just a regular landform and not an alian artifact as the world believed it was at the time.   ",2

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you get to see tons of new places. I got to see places like Europe and China. I also met and created a bond with new people, While I was there I saw new cultures. This program allowed me to be aware of other countries and there needs by not hearing about them, but actually witnessing it. I also had some fun on board with the other members of the Seagoing Cowboys club. We played games like fencing, boxing, and even table tennis.

Now if I told you that the Seagoing Cowboys program was all fun and games, I would be lying. There is a lot of work to do. One time I fell down a slippery ladder. I didn't die,(because if I did I couldn't have wrote this.)but I did get hurt badly and I cracked my ribs. There are many responsibilities while on board. I had to work with animals. I had to load and unload them off the ship. Also on my second trip I was the night watchman, and my job was to check on the animals every hour.

Even though there is is work to be done the Seagoing Cowboys program was a great opritunity for me, and it could also be a great opritunity for you.Helping out at my aunt Katie's farm prepared me, and maybe you have some preperation too.This trip taught me more than i could have ever learned at home.The Seagoing Cowboys program really opened my eyes.I hope I go again,and I hope I see you there.",3

c69b9c3,"Driverless cars are coming in the near future. There is debate for whether or not we should allow them on the public roads. People say that driverless cars are perfectly safe and that it can save the amouont of gas used currently by a lot. I think that we should allow driverless cars because they can reduce the amount of driving related accidents, car companies are already planning to release them to public consumers on specific times, and we can reduce the amount of gas used.

Driverless cars can reduce the amount of car accidents and reckless drivers. The driverless cars use sensors so it makes it safe for the drivers. Sensors are already being used on cars, for example, the Toyota Prius uses sensors on the left rear wheel,a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, and more sensors. The sensors are very advanced so they can detect and respond to danger faster than a human. The sensors can tell the car to apply brakes with a better response time and control than a human could possibly do. Sensors are only getting more advanced so it can only get safer in the future, and it is perfectly safe to use them on driverless cars. Some people may say that it is possible that a sensor fails to work or technology can get messed up, but the chance is rare and it would cause far less car accidents than if a human had full control over the wheel. The smart cars still allow control from the human and the car alerts the human if they and the car are in danger, so if something were to happen, the human could take control and try to stop it. The car still allows people to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. The Google car announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. GM made driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. Google has been testing driverless cars since 2009. Some companies are also considering using cameras to watch the drivers to make sure that they are alert and paying attention in case something happens where the human would need to take control. There has been over half a million miles on them and no crashes so far so it is perfectly safe to the consumer to use.

The driverless cars can also be used to reduce the amount of gas used today by a lot. Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, said that the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. People spend a lot of money on gas and it is expensive so if we can reduce that amount by half, then people can use that money they're saving on more important things and can possibly improve our economy.

Companies are already planning for the future. Car companies are making driverless cars and have set dates to when they will be available to consumers. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan for the release of driverless cars by 2020.

Driverless cars are in the future and companies have already planned for them, they are perfectly safe, and they can reduce the amount of spending money on gas. Driverless cars can do way more than they can do bad, and the bad is no worse than what is going on now so we should get ready for driverless cars in the future. ",4
1d197f5,"This country is built on democracy, the idea that all of its citezens have rights and a say in how the country is run. The Electoral College takes away the peoples vote, because in an election, the eligable citezens vote for a candidate, but in reality they are voting for a group of electors who will then vote for the candidate. I believe this is unfair and that the Electoral College should be removed from the country's government.

The first flaw with the Electoral College is that voters cannot directly vote for their favorite candidate. In

Source #2 paragraph 10 , it says; ""

... voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

"" If citezens of the United States can't vote for thir own president directly then it takes some of the democracy out of the country. It rarely happens but the electors don't always vote for the candidate with the most popular vote, they can vote for whoever they want, if they really wanted to. This is just one reason I think the Electoral College should be removed, and replaced by a popular vote.

My next reason for replacing the Electoral College with a popular vote is that a tie in the Electoral College is possible. In

Source #3 paragraph 18 , it says; ""

A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538-is an even number...

"" If a tie occurs then the vote goes to the House of Representatives, but how will they know the feelings of voters if they vote one party for Congress, and another party for president?

My final reason to get rid of the Electoral College is that a candidate can win the popular vote, but lose the election. In

Source #2 paragraph 9 , it says; ""...

Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the poular vote but lost the presidency...

"" If the people's favorite candidate wins the popular vote, a vote representing the country's citezens, but loses the election because of the Electoral College then the system is unfair to voters.

People supporting the Electoral College may say like in

Source #3 paragraph 19 , ""

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to select a president.

"" But this country should be about how the people vote, a popular vote would be the same, no region would have enough eligeable voters to elect a president, so a candidate would have to campaign all over the country.

In conclusion I think the Electoral College should be replaced with a popular vote. Voters cannot directly vote for thier choice candidate, ties can occur in the Electoral College, and a candidate can win the popular vote, but somehow still lose the election. The system is unfair to voters, and this country is based on fairness and rights to all of its citezens, so why should the Electoral College get to take away people's rights?    ",4

Another detail from paragraph 2 they state only because it had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh.

In the Paragraph 3 it states ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose, and mouth."" Which means that it's just a illusion it wasn't acutually seen or proven to be a human head.

Greenhouse gases are good, but too much isnt as it pollutes the air and makes it hard to breathe that air.

In short, an advantage of limiting car usage is that it is extremely beneficial for the environment as it stops some air pollution.

It will all be worth it to see the smiles on the peoples faces! We could really use your help. The following shows all the important and awsome things you need to know about it.

One of the amazing pros of joining is you can help others. As Luke says,""It was an opportunity of a life time."" Helping people get back all the food supplies, animals, and more leaves a good feeling. It could make you more aware of people of other countries and their needs, like Luke.

The only complain that you might have is a few ingerys. Like when Luke cracked his ribs on one rainy night. You may get knocked over bord but that is very unlikly. All those times you helped people will surely make up for that. It could really be fun if you just try it. If you did not like your fist trip, you could always quit. At least you helped a few people out.

A few more exiting things woulg be the chance to sight see on your free time. Luke said,""Besides helping people, their is a benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, son was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy."" You may get the pleasure of seeing one, or both of those. Would that be awsome or what?

You can also have fun on the trip back. Like how Luke got to baseball and volleyball games after the animals got droped off. Table-tennis tornaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time of being at see. That way you are not bored out of your mind on the way back.

It can also be hard work to. You have to feed and water the animals two or three times a day. Sometimes you might have to take night watchman. That is were you have to get up every hour to check out the animals and report back to the captain. Just be careful or you might get hurt, like Luke did. Helping out with the animals can be fun, too. Even if it is exstrimly hard work.

Even if it is hard work you can still have fun. Sight seeing and the trip home is amazing. So come on! Join the Seagoing Cowboys program! It can be dangderous and hard, but in the end there are more great things to do than all the small dangers. Hard work is the price to pay if you do want to join. All the sights to see, helping people in tmes of needs, and the awsome trips will be fun!

Because since you have a driverless car you are capable of practically doing anything you have to do within the time period you have from your starting destination the your final destination.

3fb4405,"Dear Mr. Senator:

Lately there's been a problem regarding electoral colleges. Some people are in favor of them; others not so much. I agree with the latter; electoral colleges are anachronistic and should no longer be used in this day and age.

In this modern era, people are being more aware or more educated about the going-ons in government. As a result, it is becoming no longer necessary to have others vote in place of the people's choices. Instead, people should be able to vote directly for their chosen leaders and not have to worry about an elector making a last minute decision to vote for another.

Those who are in favor of electoral colleges are wrong about keeping them. In only half-way allowing people to vote for president, it could also be viewed that the people were never really given a choice. Their votes are at the mercy of the electors.

If you are wise Mr. Senator, you'll choose to do away with electoral colleges. By doing so, you give people more choice and control over their decisions. I hope you'll put your foot down on this matter and refuse to have anything to do with electoral colleges because they're not helping the future of our country,

Sincerely,

aa1175f,"Dear state senator,

I believe that keeping the Electoral College is a good idea but I also think that changing to the popular vote is also a great idea. I think we should stick with the Electoral College because you vote for your president, vice president, electors, and where the electors meet all at the same time. I don't think we should change it to the popular vote because then it wouldn't be fair on the people thats running for president or electors, we also wouldn't be able to vote for everything all at once so it would make things very difficult.

Sticking with the Electoral College would be the best fit in my opinon. I believe its best to stick with because everybody knows how to use it, its been aroud for many years and it has always worked perfectly fine and has been fair. Under the 23rd Amendement of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allowed to have three electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. The eletoral college consists of 538 electors. The majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. If we switched to the popular vote, it would be nothing like how the Electoral College works. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice pressident, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. I personally like the way the Electoral College is ran/worked and thats why I feel like its best to keep it the way it has been for many, many years.

If we are to switch to the popular vote, people would b fighting and arguing constantly, there would be no piece. I dont believe anybody would be happy because thats not a fair way to choose how our President, Vice president and the Representatives should be picked. We pick a new president every four years so why don't we just keep it the way it been for a long time so we don't mess everybody up on their decisions. Another reaosn why I don't care to switch is because what if we run into a run-off election. If we run into one of those it would be hard to get out of it just because we wouldn't know what to do. Popular vote would also run us into "" swing votes. "" If we were to get stuck in a swing vote, everybody would have to re vote and then pray it dosen't happen again.

Now that I have explained myself in much detail on why I think the Electoral College should stay the same, and why the Popular vote should be thrown in the garbage, please take what I said into concideration. I'm sure I could be wrong on a lot of things but I hope I got my point out and accros on why other people and myself think it should stay the same.

4e2974e,"The author suggests that studying Venus would be scientifically productive despite the dangers the planet has. This is because Venus was once a planet like ours that could sustain life and had oceans. Knowing why it became what it is today would help our understanding of taking care of the Earth. It is also a worthy pursuit because the distance is not very far and time consuming. Exploring Venus despite its intimidating aspect would also be the start of many dangerous explorations the human race will complete.

Even though at present time Venus is nothing compared to Earth, astronomers believe that Venus had similar attributes to Earth. The planet contained features that represented Venus was ""covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth"" (Paragraph 4). Since there is a possibility that Venus had ""oceans"", water ""could have supported various forms of life"". At present time, many of the planets we study do not show attributes that are similar to Earth or were similar to Earth before until we noticed Venus. If we are able to study Venus despite the dangers it holds, we could grasp more information on why it lost its life sustaining resources. Knowing this information could be used as a fundamental source of how to keep the life sustaining resources in Earth alive.

SInce Venus is close to Earth, it would be very beneficial for our planet to consume little resources and still be able to reach Venus for scientific productivity in a short time.

Astronomers realize that if they want to visit a planet, ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit"" (Paragraph 4). Astronomers know that far space travel requires too much time, so if we are looking for information of a planet, Venus can ""be our nearest option for a planetary visit"". If we were to make machines that are durable for the conditions in Venus, the resources we need from earth will be less than compared to journeys we would have taken far away to other planets. This would be becuase Venus would only require a certain amount of energy to get there and get safely back. Another advantage to visiting a planet that is close to the Earth would be the short time that it takes. The information could be recorded when making scientific experiments and the information would come back to Earth to classify faster than compared to getting information from long journeys in deep space.

The author also supports the idea that we should explore Venus despite its dangers because as life progresses, we will encounter many explorations just as dangerous as Venus. The author believes ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors [and they] should not be limited by dangers and doubts"" (Paragraph 8). Since we will encounter ""many equally intimidating endeavors"", it is only resourceful that we start now with the exploration in Venus. In order to get a basis understanding of what is around us, our fear cannot be influenced by the ""dangers and doubts"" that many claim. The author suggests it is our responsibility to do whatever is necessary to improve our knowledge of the planets despite the dangers that influence us to stop.

Although the author does describe the challanges that we would face if we were to visit Venus, the information we would obtain from the visit would be more important. The author suggests this because Venus has a close distance to Earth and we should take advantage of that. Once there, we would gain information about how a planet that was once similar to ours became inhabitable. With that information, we would become aware of the dangers that Venus experienced and help Earth not reach such a magnitude to where it would also become inhabitable. Also, taking a step forward into explorations that are deemed too dangerous for us will break our limitations of danger and doubt. We would be able to explore anything that fascinates us.",4
6f70a6c,"The ""Face on Mars"" was a popular pop icon, it starred in Hollywood film, appearing in books, magazines,even in radio talk shows. In the article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" there are many points in the article that would support that the face is just a natural landform. But, anyway conspiracy theorists think it could be created by aliens even though there is all of this evidence to prove that wrong. In the article there are many key points to prove the conspiracy theorists' theories are wrong and that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform.

To support the idea that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform you can look into the essay. In the article, the text states,"" NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2,when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" This part of the passage starts the argument because twenty five years ago their spacecraft cameras weren't as good as the ones that were in 2001. So, the picture that came out of the spacecraft was not as clear as it could have been with a 2001 camera and with the shadows forming the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth, people thought it could have been created by alien lifeforms. To disapproved of this idea though, the text states,"" on April 8,2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enought for a second look."" Also the text says,"" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56meter compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. 'As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,' he added 'So, if there were objects in this picture like airplsnes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This evidence form the ending of the paragraph ten to the end of paragraph eleven shows how much of better quality the picture would be in when taken. The final supporting detail in the passage to prove the Face on Mars is not created by is the text states,""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or messa-landforms common around the American West"" This clearly states that its just a landform called a butte or mesa that is commonly found around the American West. This evidence clearly disapproves of the ""Face on Mars"" is not created by aliens because we have these on Earth as well.

To conclude, the ""Face on Mars"" is not created by aliens and to support the text shows evidence such as high-quality pictures and comparisons to the landform to the landforms we have on Earth.                      ",4
ee1b3c9,"Dear, State Senator I would for you to change the way presidents get elected to the United States of America. The reason for this is becuase, it would be much easier for the president, it would be easier on the states who have racial problems, and states who might cheat.

To back up my arguement, It would be much easier to abolish the electoral college. If the college was to be abolished then presidents themselves would be easily elected. Instead of electing 34 democratic electors. It would be fair to do that so that everything goes smoothly and better for everyone especially for presidents.

Next, it would go easier on states who have a bit of a racial issues. On some states it is diffcult to get elected because of racial issues. For instance, in Arizona there is a huge racial problem there and it would be difficult to elect different types of democractic electors. Thus making it difficult for Arizona to elect a president. In other staes it would also be the samething, just voting for the president would be easier.

My last reason, to abolish the electoral college is because of some states who might cheat. During election it is a diffiucult time because of every state wanting their president to one. That mabe the state would cheat the votes into elect those 34 democratic electors that will do anything to cheat. Another example, is in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose popular John F. Kennedy.

In Conclusion, the Electoral college needs to be abolish because it would be easier to vote for presidents, also it would be easier for states who have racial issues, and for states who are unfaithful.                    ",3
f474b95,"Challenge of exploring Venus wouldn't it be fun? Like many other challenges in the world today that are dangerous, the challenge of exploring Venus is also dangerous but exploring Venus is worth it unlike the other challenges in the world now. If we actually wanted to explore Venus than we have to get up close to Venus cause we cannot just merely look at it from afar. Challenge of exploring Venus could also help us expand our imagination to the extented. Our innovation could meet the very edges of our already have innovation.

First, wanting to acually know the planet itself. We must be able to get close to the planet if we want to get a samples of anything from there since getting it from afar is not gonna help. The author stated that "" More importanly, reseachers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" This shows that we have to get up close to the planet to know about the planet. Therefore some scientists are now conducting away to get up close to the planet, even though there are much risk to it.

Secondly, our imagination of we know more about Venus. Our imagination are limited, but if we know more about Venus our imagination could go wild. The article stated "" imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" The author is basically telling us to imagine the impossible that could happen if we know about Venus. Therefore knowing more about Venus might even be a good thing.

Lastly, our innovation could be at its very edge. Our innovation right now are very amazing but imagine the new ones we could build if we know about Venus. The author stated in the article saying ""Our travel on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expended to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

Our innovation right now are limited to do simple things as of now. If we know more about Venus we would have no limits to our innovation we would even have more access to a lot of things.

In conclusion, taking the challenge of exploring Venus would be dangerous, but would also benefit us. In many different ways we could have a better innovation. We could imagine the impossible that we can't right now. So taking the challenge is not a bad thing, we just need to have a safe conduction so that we could know more about the planet itself.",4
03d8fe8,"Imagen being in a regular classroom. Imagen yourself not understing the topic. Imagen not being able to tell the teacher you don't get it because you're afraid to be made fun of. This is what the Facial Action Coding System prevents student from experiencingwhen taught a new topic. This helps student by having the system already knowing they don't understand to topic they had just learned. Although Facial Action Coding System watches your face is wierd, it'll help out teachers and students because it'll help our classroom be more understanding, helpful, and communicate better.

The Facial Action Coding System can help classrooms be more understanding.

In the article, it states, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feelling simply by the look on her face (paragraph 5)."" It also states,""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears in you screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be differnet (paragraph 6)."" These quotes show that classrooms can be more understanding with this system. Because if you frown, the teacher will be notified and will ask if you understand yet or need help. And this system will help teachers to more ""calculated"" of what their class needs more work on. And understand the topic they have learned.

The Facial Action Coding System can help classrooms be helpful. In the article it states,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor (paragraph 6) ."" This means that this system can be helpful by providing information to the teacher. And so the teacher can have an effective teaching plan to help out the class in learning the topic better. So they don't get lost and confused on the topic.

The Facial Action Coding System can help classrooms communicate better. In the article it said,""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. ""Most humans communication in nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to undersatnd that, too(paragraph 6)."" This all means that this sysytem will help us communicate better. And because most of human communication happens nonverbally. It won't be too diffcult to do. This system will help the students and the teacher to communicate with each other effectivly without saying a word.

In concluion, better communication, more helpful, and more understanding are some of the pros of having the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom. Although having the Facial Action Coding System watch your face is pretty weird. Other than that, it's pretty cool that it can help the student(s) and the teacher. The students get a chance to work together to help the teacher understand them better. This system helps them communicate better overall. And helps the teacher to create a better and effective teaching plan overall, too. This Facial Action Coding System helps the student and the teacher to understand, comunicate and help each other.

""Hey, Luke,"" says Mort and Jake.

They say,""Uh, we have something to tell you. We aren't joining the UNRRA.""

I say,""What? How come you don't want to join the UNRRA?""

Jake says,""Well, I'm sort of afraid of oceans or lands of water.""

""No need to worry about that,"" I say,""You would be distracted by all the amazing places we get to see such as how I got to see Crete and I got to see the Panama Canal.""

""Oh really?"" says Jake,""I've never knew that, thanks for telling me. I might join the UNRRA, now.

""Would't you be on the ship all the time? I want to have some sort of fun while i'm on the ship,"" says Mort.

I say,""No need to worry about that, Mort. We do a lot of things to past time on the boat.""

Mort says,""Really? What do you guys do?""

I say,""Well, there's Table-Tennis, Fencing, Boxing, Reading, Whittiling, and games to pass up the time.""

""Oh, that's all I wanted to know,"" Mort says.

I say,""Now, are all of you convinced to join the UNRRA?""

Both Mort and Jake say,""oh, yes we are!""

So, as you can see, convincing friends to do something can be hard at times. Sometimes, you just have to have the facts to come with you. I'm very glad I signed up for the UNRRA in the past because is I didnt, I problaby wouldn't have been able to convince them to come. ",3
cd9f561,"I believe the author supports his claim that studying Venus is a worthy cause despite the dangers it presents by stating ways it could benefit the human race. I see the author use many examples of how exploring Venus will help the human race now and in the future. I think the author really believes that exploring Venus is a worthy cause.

The author states that ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This is one of his many reasons why we should explore Venus, because in the future it could possibly be our new home. The author also states that ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various types of life."" This is yet another example the author presents to show why Venus is so worthwhile. So one of the main reasons the author believes Venus is a worthy cause despite its dangers, is because in the future it could possibly be our new home.

The author also states that

""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author means if we can get past the challenges of Venus it will allow us to face other challenges in the future. The author tells us that we should ""not be limited by dangers and doubts,"" and that we should explore into the ""very edges of imagination and innovation."" The author wants Venus to just be a stepping stone in our long journey of challenges. The author wants it to be something we overcome and get past so we can explore and learn new things.

Even with the many dangers the auhtor stated we can all see exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit. Dangers such as: 800 degree weather, the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than Earths, and the sulfuric acid clouds are some of the many challenges preventing us from exploring Venus close up. To overcome these the author hints at a need for stronger materials and a way to survive the temperatures and pressures in such an environment . But the author has hope that we will figure all of this out. The author even states that a material called silicon carbide has been tested in conditions such as Venus's and have shown to last up to three weeks. He also states that we are thinking of using old mechanical computers to send to Venus because they can be made more durable. So the authors hope for exploring Venus close up may be made into a reality.

So in conclusion the authors support of his belief that studying Venus is a worthy cause despite the dangers it presents are strong and have many benefits. The author believes it will benfit us now and in future endeavors. There are many promising technologies being developed for this specific reason. There may be hope for exploring Venus afterall.",4
2036c27,"This author really wants to explor venus despite all the dangers there are. I feel like the author did have his own opinion of still exploring Venus, but he makes the danger sound so huge but tells it to us like it is not a big deal, and also came up with the idea of using technology to find out more about Venus.

Although Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system we have to understand more about it and the consequences and danger of going there. If for example the astronaut really did want to explore the place he would have to know the safety of how it's like over there first or else his family member might not see him back home and would never see his discoveries. I personally feel like they should of said we will learn more about the safety and build things to protect the people going there and exploring instead of saying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author did catch my attention when they said they were going to create a machine, and I strongly like that idea but afterwards he was saying the explorer still had to be around thirty-plus miles above the ground making me feel like it is still dangerous with or without the machine. Like in this quote, ""Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.""

In conclusion that is why I think the author did not really support his ideas, but overall I liked how he came up with different ideas during his research of how we are going to achieve the idea of reaching to Venus. ",2

The Seagoing Cowboys go from country to country helping them restore their crops and animals. And while your on the boat, you get to look after animals such as horses, cows, and even mules!

You should join their program because, you would learn how to cope with hard labor, AND you would be helping your country. Being a part of this group is a once-in-a-life-time experience, and you don't want to pass it up.

The pros of being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you would get to see fascinating places you probably wouldn't see otherwise. Such as Greese, New Orleans,and even oceans like the Atlantic or the Pacific. And you could also make a lot of friends on the way.

The cons of being a part of this would be that you might not be able to see your family very often. You might miss the family holidays, like Christmas and Thanksgiving, but you can still talk to them over the phone and communicate with letters.

While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examin more closely. And it says that venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. In space terms humans have sent mumerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world.

I think that Venus is the most populer planet that every one talks about and it seams that is is the closest planet to the sun. Venus and Mars our other planetary neighbor that are closer to the sun.

451c458,"Driverless Cars

Should driverless cars be developed? Google cofounder Sergey Brin has envisions of the future with a public transporation systems where fleets of driverless cars form public transport taxi system. Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Driverless cars should be developed.

One reason why driverless cars should be developed is because it's safer than a human driver. In the passage the author states,""In the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes"". These sensors are advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels reducing power from the engine, allowing better response and control than a human driver could manage.

Another reason why driverless cars should be developed is because it's not completly driverless. In the passage the author says,"" The car can handle driving functions at speeds up tp 25 mph, but special touch sensors make the driver keep hold of the wheel. The car also notifys the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.

Some people might say driverless cars should no be created, their wrong. Not only is it safer, it's also half the fuel of today's taxi system. Also driving in a fun way. In addition it offers more flexibility than a bus.

In conclusion driverless cars should be developed for many reasons. For one it's safer, cheaper on gas and it mimics the skill of a human at the wheel. ",3

Take a minute and compare this new piece of technology to a quiz given on the internet to see what celebrity I would be. Moral of the story if the person can fake it, they can make it.

A student may come in looking grumpy does not mean they are grumpy, maybe just maybe have you ever thought. "" WOW, that just might be their natural facial expression.""

I feel that a computer shouldnt be able to tell wether or not a human being is sad or mad, it shouldnt be able to tell our emotions. Our emotions is for us to handle. Yes, us humans can tell when people we know are sad or down, but computers should not. People would use the computer for somthing else, like to see others emotions. Peoples emotions should keep to their self. It isnt for a computer or other humans to now, because its your emotion.

Yes, this could be valuable for some things, like movies, and video games. THis is not something we could use everyday in a classroom. We could use the computer to see whats wrong with a student. Once we figure out whats wrong with the student, for instance lets say the child is sad. The child is so sad, he cant work or do anything, and us humans cant notice it because he is hiding it. We could use the computer to see what emotions he is having. Once we figure that out we could help him, by doing somthing that makes him happy.

This computer couldnt be valuable in a classroom. If a teacher assigned their students to make a project over the expressions of a human.

cb01da9,"Driverless cars are coming to us in the near future. These cars are capable of driving themelves. For now, they still need human interaction or assistance and human skill in order to safely navigate through work zones, or around accidents. This means that the driver would have to remain alert at all times when the car is driving itself. Driverless cars can cause a lot of problems, but have some features that could really help us on the road.

Driverless cars should not be further developed or put on the market because it is too unsafe to have technology do something as dangerous as driving. There are endless situations, which means that you cannot program a computer to do all of them for you. Especially when it comes to driving through a contruction site, on back roads that are not marked on a map, or up a driveway where precise steering is required. The only reason that this whole push for driverless cars was created, is because people found it too much of a chore to pay attention at all times when driving. Driving should be something that people take very seriously, which people in this day and age seem to miss. Drivers should want to drive safely, which is why the push for driverless cars makes no sense. There is no way that a computer can do everything that a human can do when it comes to driving. However, some of the features of the driverless cars could be helpful, like the cameras on the rear of the car, and on the rearview mirror to help with backing. This could come into play when using precise backing, where you need an extra set of eyes to look behind you in order to see all angles. Also, the GPS reciever would be very helpful if you were ever lost and needed assistance on directions to find your way.

We should put the idea of further development of driverless cars away, and focus on some of the features that would go into a driverless car, that could better improve our cars right now. Driverless cars would just be too unsafe when it comes to the needed actions, like human skill. Drivers would not feel safe enough to drive them, and in the future when we finally get used to driving them, drivers would not pay enough attention to make the actions that actually require human skill. Driverless cars can cause a lot of problems, but have some features that could really help us on the road.   ",3

What if the student wasn't even paying attention to the lesson and it causes it to register there mood but there mood isnt based off the lesson because there not paying attention so it would be invaild infomation.

It also poses a security threat to the students or surrounding family because if it can see faces what else would it see or even not mean to capture but does.

Well i think otherwise. Electoral College is a process, not a place , which the election of the President is by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College do consists of choosing the electors, reasons to keep the Electoral College method of choosing the president.

The start of the Electoral College is well handingly choosing the electors, which consists of 538 electors each of course must be qualified. Most of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. The number of members in its Congressional delegation is equal to the entitled allotment of electors in your state, one is for each member in the house of Representatives plus two for the Senators. For the purposes of Electoral College, Columbia District is allowed 3 electors and is treat like a state. and when i say ""state"" for this topic i mean the District of Columbia.

Well backed up reasons to keep the Electoral College method of choosing the president, A outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, just look back at the year 2000 it was less likely then a come over the popular vote the Reason for that is the winning candidate's share of the Electioral College expanded his share of the popular vote. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.

""Electoral College is a process, not a place "" each and every step of the Electoral college method comes out to be a well handed system. Its more then enough fairness included when choosing the Presisent and Vice President. Popular vote is more based on ""winner-take-all"" System thats awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate, unlike the Electoral College which is a process that consists of choosing the electors, reasons to keep the Electoral College method of choosing the president.

First , Venus is the closest planet to Earth int terms of density and size,and occasionally the closest in distance too. Probaby there is life in Venus because is close to Earth,for being close to the Earth it could share Oxygen, in some places of Venus. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit"".

Second,if something happens to Earth we could go to Venus. Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various form of life,just like Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar such as valleys,mountains, and craters.""On planet's surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our owm planet"".

Finally,NASA must go to Venus to test if humans can live there,or if there is a good place to live. No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any palnet in our solar system,even though Mercury is closer to our sun"". Venus having the hottest temperature may cause diseas in humans, but if NASA proves that these can cause diseas ,they will find a cure or they will do something ,to help humans,and to create a new place to live.

In conclusion ,we should study more about Venus,maybe we can find new places there to live. Or we can get to know all the similar things that we have on our own planet. We can discovere things that we haven't seen. There is many things that we have to know that are around us. We have to learn more about ,living in other planet besides Earth. Venus can also be the second planet whre humans can live.                                    ",4
aba1c2e,"Landform or alien? The face on Mars looks pretty cool right. This face of Mars made it to hollywood and radio talks and books. People were egar to see this face, once they saw it then there was alien talk. We all know its cool to think there might be life out there, but it's just a natural landform.

Even though this face is so detailed with the mouth and the eyes and nose, it's just a natural landform. NASA even said it for themselves. "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was NO alien monument after all."" So, If a professional NASA team says it's a landform, i'm not going to argue on the debate.

However if your still not conviced I have more to prove. I haven't heard any information about aliens being true or alive. So, why would we still believe and hold on to the fact that there may not be life out there. NASA hasn't said anything about aliens but they have said that things happen. Such as the face on mars.

Although there are many, many facts about the face on Mars, I would get if you came up to me and said ""Aliens did this to Mras because its so detail and how could that be if no one has been to Mars, so there are aliens."" Only because we don't actually know if there are aliens ,but in the end its just lava that created this dome like face. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

In conclusion there are no aliens and its just a landform. NASA said it's just a landform and there isn't really information about aliens so im going to say that it just happened to be a lucky landform that just happened to show up as a face. ",3
64292c0,"Ever since the dawn of the space age, humans have been dreaming of traveling to our nieghbors in the solar system, Venus and Mars. Great strides have been made in the exploration of Mars. It is quite possible that within the next few years, astronauts will be visiting Mars and and studying the Red Planet in person. Such advances hve not been made in the exploration of Venus however. The environmental conditions of Venus have made it impossible for humans to make on the ground exploation of Venus a reality.

The third paragraph of the article gives a great host of reasons why we should not explore Venus. On the other hand, the reasons to visit Venus are, dare I say, lacking. The author points out the highly corrosive atmosphere, the extreme tempuratures, and the sky high pressure on the surface of Venus. They aslo point out that because of these difficult conditions, noone has ever been able to land even an unmanned spaceship on the planet without it being melted within a few hours.

The evidence to support going to Venus is average at best. The strongest argument given by the author is in paragraph 4 where they say, "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This may be true, but I think the author has still given insufficient evidence for why it would be benificial to explore Venus. It may be possible in the future that new technologies allow us to explore Venus, but for now I think we should wait.

In closing, sometime in the forseeable future, it may be more possible and logical to visit Venus. In our current situation, I think it would be much more benefical to advance our technologies enough to where we can land on the surface and get a close look around. Though we may not have the materials today to withstand the harsh climate of Venus, we should still be inventing and advancing our technologies. Who knows, maybe we could make a discovey on Mars that could help us finally reach the ""Evening Star"", Venus.      ",4

Others may agree to have driverless cars but I don't think it is a good idea to have driverless cars it may be safe to other but it is not safe to me because I wouldn't want to have a wreck driving in a driverless car. It is good to have motion sensored cameras on the back and front of some vehicles but it is not good to have a car that parks itself because you could maybe put the car in to driverless mode it may cause a wreck or crash while the car is parking or driving on it's own. it is not good to have antilock brakes either bc you could be on your way to work and your coming to a yellow light that is turning red you may not be paying attention and not have your seatbelt on and the car just brakes on it's own it could cause serious and major injuries to you or anyone else who may be in the car with you.,2

Luke got to go to cool places he never been to. He got to visit Europe, China, Greece, and Italy. There is also help for countries to recover what they lost like food supplies, animals, and more.

One time it was raining and a there was a small strip of metal and he slid from keepinhg him from falling of the ship.

Then if there was ever something like this technoligy i dont think it will work very well considering that every one is in school and mostly when anybody is in school they are usually bummed out about being in school and i think the machine will read mixed emotions and the computer or the device will read everyones emotions wrongs because like they say id in the first paragragh how she had mixed emotions I think that that is pretty crazy to have for just one person because

I dnt think just one person can ever hve that many emotions even if was a cartoon or a painting

Lastly i dont think that everybody in my school will allow the emotion reader decide there amotions because like me I will not feel comfortable with one of those readers lie many other people in my classroom will be comfortable with that reader to decde or find out there emotions because the reader might get the wrong emotion and people might start making fun of other peoples emotions and there might be a big argument with the reader and somebody might get mad because that is not how they are feeling and people might get mad because the reader might say something about somebodys buisness and people might get embarassed about what other people might think about ther hidden emotions.

4b0dcc9,"I have been working with Nasa now for three years and not one have I heard some crazy things like this. How can people possibly think they are being reached out by aliens that is just so crazy I cant stress that enough. I think if aliens were real why would they want to be found if they are smart like people think they are because they can fly a spaceship then why would they leave that face there for us to find it.

If I was a alien I would not want to be found because who knows what they would do to me I would be so so frighten its not even funny. The other reason why I dont think it has anything to do with an alien is because where is that face from? Is it from an alien or human? How to we know if its even a face it can simply just be a rock that looks like face we do not know sure. For all we know this picture can actually be fake. They might just have wanted people to start thinking its a face and that we are living under aliens. I think my team in Nasa is just crazy straight up crazy.

So this is what I think about the whole alien thing this is not alien related stuff at all. It was never anything about alien stuff or egyption goddess stuff either its jusyt simply a rock that look like a face nothing more notrhig less.      ",2
8569767,"The author does not support their idea of Venus being a planet worth exploring despite the risk and dangers very well. There are examples or facts that the author provides to the reader that are sometimes insignifigant to the point. The author also provides information that is very detrimental to their claim and only makes their aruement weaker. The reason why the information is detrimental is because the author fails to give any counter arguement that would be convincing enough to to at least have the reader understand their side.

To start, in the third paragraph the author list many reasons why Venus is difficult to explore and ather information on. Later in the fourth paragraph the author talks about how enthusiastic scientist are to explore the planet and how it may have been like Earth at some point. If the author were to reorganize the fourth paragraph giving the teorey that Venus was once like Earth and then going on to give the inputs of scientist it would have made more sense going into the fifth paragraph. In paragraph five the author writes about how NASA has ideas on how scientist can observe Venus without entering its toxic and dangerous enviornment. The author also explains the conditions the scientist would be under if they were to make this idea a reality and said conditions would make any who oppose this idea less open to the thought than they already are, which is not the point of the article. In paragraph six the author talks about how while scientist could observe Venus if they were to go through with the plan NASA has it would ultimatly be for nothing as scientist would have no way to gather information worth sending back.

The author does have points that support the claim but said points were either useless to the overall idea or were organized in a poor manner. The author also provides arguements that counter their claim and says nothing to counter those arguements back. The author also talks about human exploratiom in the article but it essientially amounts to nothing. The reason why is because the author later goes on to talk about machines on the planet itself making most of the information provided before hand obselete. If the author left most of the article out the claim may have actually been supported well although the information provided woul have been lackluster.     ",3
a1d87ab,"Driverless cars sound like an exciting concept. In paragraph two it even says how people have been fasinating with cars that could driver themselves for ages now. But, in my opinion I believe driverless cars wouldn't be a good idea.

The passage gives many reasons why driverless cars would be good and why they'd also be bad. In my opinion they'd just cause more trouble than regular cars already do. In the passage it says how they have a lot of sensors, and gadgets to make them ""safe,"" but what happens when one or a two of those sensors go out? And then the owner of the car doesn't have the money to go out and buy a new one. They're going to be driving a car that not only is putting themselves in danger, but also the people around them.

Another reason why I believe that driverless cars wouldn't be a good idea is because of what was stated in paragraph 9. What's going to happen when the car gets in an accident and causes damage to another driverless car? We already have laws that go along with regular cars, and to whom is at fault when an accident happens. These cars are going to cause so much more drama than there already is! There are going to be accidents, there is no way we can avoid it. There are going to be malfuntions in the driverless car. There are still malfunctions in the cars we drive today and you see how long we've been dribing them around! Driverless cars are only going to cause more problems that we don't need.

Let's say driverless cars become a reality, and they're everywhere. What's going to happen to the cars we drive today? I absolutly love cars, and the reason I love cars is because as a teenager that just got her license not too long ago; this is what I've been looking forward to since age seven! If manually driven cars get taken away from us how are we going to know who's worthy of driving on the street? Driverless cars are going to be everywhere. They're going to be the cars teens take their drivers test in. How exactly are people going to be able to determine whether or not they're going to be safe on the roads if a car is doing all of the work for them? I just don't see how people expect this all to work out, but then again this is probably what people were thinking when they were transitioning over from hourse and buggies to automobiles.

I believe driverless cars are a bad idea. There are dozens of details in this article to back me up on this. I've always believed why change something that's already good? It's like your mom making your favorite apple pie. It's the best apple pie you've ever had in your life. And one day your mom decides she wants to change it up a bit, and that change just completly ruins it for you. It'll never be the same again because of that one time that she decided to change it up. And that's how I see driverless cars. I see them as something that'll just ruin it for everyone. Manually driving a car gives you such a rush, it's the first thing in your life that makes you feel independent. It makes in feel like you're finally in control of your life for the first time. I feel as though it would be a shame to take that away from the people who haven't experienced it for themselves.",4

e9701ba,"The people have a right to say what they want to happen in their community, state, and even as far as the country they live in. They should be able to decide whether they want a park built in their city or whether they want a specific up and coming President. Yes, popular vote at the moment seems favorable for the people, but it does not mean that the people don't vote in the the process of the Electoral College. They truly do vote for their president, just not in a way that they would like. Nonetheless, they do. That being said, the system of election should be kept to the Electoral College.

To begin with, the Electoral College, in a sense, is not democratic, as seen in modern times but it does not mean that it is not equal. Yes, they are voting for an elector in their state, trusting that they would vote for their chosen candidate. ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)...,"" as shown by Richard A. Posner in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"". This means that, even though the people are voting for an elector to pass on their message, they are still voting to make sure that the president they want to take the seat will get it. The electors so rarely betray the trust of the voters; it has happened one time in 2000, but again that was the first time since 1888. The most thoughtful voters will listen closely to the campaign, then choose which president they feel is fit. Which again, leads to the voters deciding, in the end. Furthermore, the larger states get more attention than the smaller states making it equal amongst those that have more population. For the most part, the Electoral College is equal.

However, others can argue against the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always,"" said Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong."" That being said, sure they can't control that but the elector rarely betrays the trust of the voters, only happening twice in recorded history. The Electoral College is still less likely to cause a problem than popular vote would. If popular vote were to play in hand as a system of choosing the president, then things outside of even politics such as, riots, would get out of hand. ""...in the Constitution as  comprimise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens,""as said by the Office of the Federal Register in ""What Is the Electoral College?"" Either way, voters do get popular vote, and vote for their elector to vote for their chosen President. It is a balanced idea of both a government and citizen based vote for the leader of the country.

Overall, the Electoral College by far is a balanced system than popular vote is. It is fair, in the sense, that everybody gets a vote and in total, their votes go to what they think is best for their country. Which in turn, does allow for them to decide.                    ",5

When driverless cars are made, people might start texting while the car is driving thinking they're still safe when they could still be in danger. Driverless cars is a good and bad idea, its cool but it could still be dangerous. I think they should not make driverless cars because we don't need them when we can drive on our own. Since it is computer what if hackers hijacked it? Or maybe it messed up because its computer made and the driver has no control? There are many things that could possibly happen since its ""computer driven"". There was something on the news before about people hijacking cars and other things, think about how easy it could be to get control of a computer driven vehicle, it would probably be more easy. If they are gonna bring them I think they should add security or something, maybe do a whole bunch of tests with devices to make sure that it's safe. This vehicle doesn't just put the driver in danger, but it also can put other peoples life in danger. If a person crashed into another person they could die. I know for sure that when I get older and start driving, I probably wont get a driverless car if they come out because in my opinion I think that these sound pretty dangerous and I don't wanna get hurt or something to happen. This actually probably could help people who are hurt/injured who can't drive get to places possibly. So I think maybe they could add them aslong as they make sure its as safe as possible.",2
2823ac5,"Dear state senator,

The way that we vote our next president has to change. Election by popular vote is more reasonable and smarter than using the Electoral College. As stated in The Indefensible Electoral College it is stated that ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor."" The Electoral College  is not a smart way to vote the president because voters are not voting for him, they are voting for the electors of his or her state who could turn around and elect the opposite candinate than what the voter wanted.

Although I think that the Electoral College is useless others think it is. One of these people is Richard A. Posner who states in his article that it is entirely possible that the  winner of the national popular vote will not win the election but this happens rarely. He also states that ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president,not the people."" This is proof that even thouh people defend the Electoral College, the popular vote system is the more democratic and right way to elect the president.

Electing the president by popular vote is the best way to solve the problems in the presidential voting process. With this the people who are the voters will be the ones who elect the president. Unlike the Electoral College there will be no slate of electors who choose the president based off of the people's vote. Popular vote makes every voters choice matter with the elction of the president.            ",3
392298c,"Many of us are used to getting somewher by simply using a car, but should we always use a car. If we limit car usage we can solve most of our problems. We can save ecomically and collect less polution

In source one the German Suburbs are car free, where street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbiden generally. Car ownership is allowed, however where a car-owner buys space for their car has to pay near $40,000, along with a home. As a result according to source one 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars , and 57 percent sold a car to move here. Many citizens complain when the gas prices go up, but if we limit our car ussage we wont have to complain anymore. We will save money, because when we decrease the usage of cars we wont use as much gas or deisel. Heidrun Walter told Elisabeth Rosenthal that he now lives happier this way. Not only do we save money but we also relieve tension through out our bodies.

However we may not enjoy this new idea of limiting car usage some of us actually enjoy driving but, there are days where after a long day of working the last thing you want to be in is in traffic jams.""It's a good opporunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman named, Carlos Arturo Plaza who rides a two seat bicycle with his wife.

In other ways that limiting car usage could help us is by eliminating pollution, of course everyone enjoys breathing in fresh air. By limiting car usage we can help lower polution. According to source two,"" After days ofe near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city,"" the usage of car produced so much smog that they had to ban driving. Many of use drive to so many places that are near by that in reality we dont really have to use our car not only will we reduce pollution, but we will also maintain ourselves fit by using different alternatives like, walking, running, ridding our bikes. Although some may say, "" what if its an emergency,"" its fine we're only limitting car usage, we aren't goining to ban it forever.

If we limit car usage we can not only save money, but we can also reduce polution, and have a better lifestyle. Although these aren't the only ways limiting car usage can benefit us.    ",4
095d62a,"Technology is becoming a bigger part of our lives. As time goes on, we develop new technology for different purposes. One such purpose is to read emotions. This technology will benefit our society in different ways, like in education. The technology to read students emotions is valuable to our schools.

The first way in which this technology is vaulable to schools is by improving lessons. Often times, many students of different calibers are thrust into the same classroom. While some grow bored others become confused by the content of the lesson. In the article, Dr. Huang is quoted saying, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" and then ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. If we implemented this emotion recognition technology, we could help students of all levels grow and reach their potential.

Another reason why technology that can recognize emotions is vaulable in schools is because of fighting and bullying. In paragraphs three and four of the article, it discusses how the technology works and what it can do. It claims that it can dectect mixed emotions and even, in paragraph 8, detect fake smiling. This technology could be used to detect when students are angry and wanting to fight or even sad from being bullied. Teachers cannot always detect these things from students, especially if they are trying to hide them.

In addition to stopping fights and helping bullied students, this emotion recognition technology could assist in identifying students who have problematic home lives and need help. Although this would not always be 100% accurate, it could help faculty see those students who might be depressed or angry, and need help. This would aid in making schools a happier place. It could also negate problems that they could have later in life. Installing this technology in our schools would be highly beneficial.

Schools need the technology to read students emotions. It would fit in with other technological advancements that have improved our education system. Advances in technology helped to improve not just our education, but our overall lives. Numerous people in our world cannot live without technology. Technology is important to our society.

929142b,"I highly suggested that the Electoral college should be changed to the election by popular vote for the president of the Untied States instead. With the electoral college system voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. The problem with this is that when the electors go to vote for the presient, who are the electors? They could be anybody, so how would we know if our president that got choose had it fairly? Well, we dont. Instead of having the electoral college system we should change it to the popular vote of the people. By doing so, we can know that the president that got choose had it fair with all the other presidents that decided to run for the position to. Instead of when voting it being called a natural disaster which is what is known for as the electoral college we can know we voted fair by voting with the election by popular vote.

The people in the community should have the right in this because of the fact that , each and everyday we are going to have to live by the rules of the president, so we should have the right to vote for the president, and the outcome for whoever wins would be fair because thats who most the people think should run our country. At the basic level, the electoral college is unfair to the voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, only focusing on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. It is officaial the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

With that being said i hope that the decision of changing the voting system from the electoral college system to the election by popular vote, and the outcome be very potitive.            ",3

Along with having the highest temperature recorded, Venus also has an atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than the atmospheric pressure on Earth. Clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid also coat Venus's atmosphere, making it difficult to even make it through the outer layers of Venus's atmosphere. So why would Earth's scientists still want to vist Venus?

According to the article, Venus is the planet that is most similar to Earth, well at least it used to be. The author tells the reader about how Venus was probably covered in oceans that could have supported life, similar to Earth. The planet also has many other land forms that are similar to the ones we have here on Earth, such as, valleys, rocks, and craters. The author proceeds to say that ""the value of returning to Venus is indisputable."" Although there are many dangers of sending vessels back to Venus, the author states that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, otherwise known as NASA, is working on ways to send astronauts to Venus. The author also tells the reader that solar power on Venus would be abundant, and that radiation levels would be similar to those on Earth. He goes on to say that the temperature would be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, not an ideal temperature for astronauts traveling to Venus, but it is survivable.

While traveling to Venus may take Earths scientists years to figure out, and be very costly, the information we could learn would be invaluable. Although Earth's scientists may be faced with many problems while trying to get astronauts to Venus, from the information provided in the article you could infer that he strongly believes that it is possible, and not only believes that we could travel to Venus but encourages it.",3
b0f2bb9,"Driverless cars have good and bad things that would go along with them. From my perspective though I believe that we could go without them. Cars that can drive themselves not only puts the one driving in danger but anyone around the car. Having driverless cars just makes us lazy,if we can not drive a car. Driverless cars should not be something we should invest our money into.

Cars that can drive themselves is a very dangerous and scary idea. A big machince that is operating itselve around others that are doing the exact thing is not a good idea. Very many mechanical mishaps could happen easily to cause the car to do things it wasnt made to do. If an animal or a person would happen to jump in the street would the car be able to detect that and stop the car before something very bad was to happen?

Having driverless cars puts a bad message on us. Having driverless cars would mean we dont want to drive or are too tried to drive or just to lazy. I think that this would make the United states look bad if we were to happen to get driverless cars.

Driverless cars may save us money individualy but over all as a coutry I think we could lose money. Driverless cars have so many sensors and devices that would need to be installed and would have to be manufactured which causes a lot of money. ""These smart road systems worked suprisingly well,but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.""

c4f9b90,They should do the program because in the program you will learn how to be a cowboy. Also you will learn how to travel the seas and survive in cold wheather. So being in the program could be fun because you will learn how to be a cowboy. Luke wants to be a segoing cowboy because he likes to travel the seas and he also likes to be a cowboy. Another reason is because he wants to have fun as a cowboy and he really wants to go travel the seas. He wants to have fun because he never has fun at his house so that is why he wants to have some fun. His house is probably boring so that is also why he wants to go outside and have some fun at the program because he wants to get out of his house and have fun. He wants to go outside and do the program so he can be a cowboy and have fun. To train to be a cowboy you have go through obstacles and overcome your fears so you can travel the seas. You also want to be able to ride the waves so you be brave and save people from your enemies. You also defenitely need to be strong so you can overcome your fears and fight bad guys so you can take them down so that is why you need to be strong. You also need to be brave so if you get put in a bad situation you will know how to get out of the bad situation so you won't get hurt while you are in the bad situation so that is why need to learn how to get out of a bad situation. You also need to learn how to stay calm in a bad situation if you do not stay calm then you will get hurt so that is why you need to learn how to stay calm in a bad situation. You need to watch out for the terrible situations in the terrible situations then you will get hurt. In the bad situations you usually will not get hurt or injured. So if you are a cowboy you need to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations because you will get hurt. So that is why you have to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations. So you have to at least tryout for the seagoing cowboys program because you never know what could happen at the program. You could have fun or you could get hurt or injured. So you have to watch out for that so you do not get hurt or injured. If you want to be a cowboy you have guns to protect yourself and when enemies try to shoot you then you can shoot them instead. So you might not get hurt if you carry guns on you for protection. ,2
808ef10,"The way I think about this articale is that I dont think that it will be a good idea for use. because what if you where puting on a face. If we put this technology into are computers it would mess with people that look like they are struguling for a person that is just boted and does not want to do it. So they would wast there time if it would go throw a deminstration about how to do it. Even if was a thing that was just for your computer it would not be fun. Do to the fact that it mite mess with what you are trying to do.

One the part with people puting on a face what if you where smiling but was acutually sad just for the fact that you had to. Many times when you see a picture it may look like he/she are acting like that but are actualy not so it could through it off and mabey get you confused on the way.

On the other hand it could help you like if some one was thinking of some thing and you could not help them or dont know if to do somthing or not. Mabey you could make it into something small like a app on a phone. People would use it to have fun with while walking or try to make it a game among friends that are around you and see if you can tell one anothers expreshons.",2
10db454,"Dear State Senator,

Honestly sir/ma'm i think that it would be way better if we just changed our election on popular vote instead of having it as an electoral college. Me personally i think that the whole electoral college thing is kinda dumb mainly because what it stated. That paragraph mainly talked about how the electoral college consist of 538 electors, and 270 votes are required to elect the president. Honestly it probably wouldnt be as difficult if you just voted on most popular. For example the ""disaster factor"" was named the single best argument and that was about how americans should be lucky that that 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. Im not gunna lie there was a little bit of some negatives effect. For example if we would of did popular votes when president John F. Kennedy ran, he would of lost the election and had not became our prsident. Lucily we didnt change the system then, am i right. Although it has some negatives there is way more positive effects. Im not saying using the electoral college way is bad because they do have some good cause; for example there is atleast 5 good reasons. Hopefully you know all 5 but ill tel you my top 3 reasons on how the electoral college has some good effects. On good positive effect is how hey say it, ""Everyone's President"". What they mean by that is like how no region would have enough votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorie like Romeny was in the south had no incentive to campian heavily in those states. another good reason was named ""Big States"". They meant like every big state like Texas lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. One last reason was known as ""Swing States"". By that they meant like what had happened with Nixon and Clinton. They both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a major in the electoral college. But like i said there is still some negatives about it and my opinion like i said was to vote on popularity. So Mr/Mrs State Senator you got my opion, you should use it.

Sincerely,

c4b5c88,"The Face of Mars was discovered by one of NASA's Viking spacecraft in 1976. It has been discused that it was created by living organims, called aliens, or that it is just a natural landform of the planet. Although both answer could be true, the reasonable one is the fact that the Face of Mars is just a landform.

In 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took a picture of what is called the Face of Mars. According to the text, ""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Later on in the text it is stated that, ""When the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"". This passage shows that when the first picture was taken, the technology was not as develloped as it is now. The scientific world has taken a big step toward technology and this new science has given scientists more information toward the solar system that were unknown before.

Nevertheless, after this research people were still not satiesfied with the fact that the Face of Mars is just a landform. They believed that the picture was not taken at the right place.

Scientists were determied to prove them wrong. So, they engage into a new study. It is stated that on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Suveyor took another look to the planet Mars. According to the text, ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the Field of view,"" said Garvin. ""Malin's team captured an extraorinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Each pixels in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."", this quote shows that the scientists of this research took careful attention to their research to make sure they would obtain correct facts. Later on in the texts, it is explain that what came out of the picture was just a landform like the ones we can find on Earth. For instance, the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

In conclusion, even though it might be hard for some people to believe the Face of Mars is just a landforms, all the studies scientists have done shows that it is just a landform.        ",4

This new software,the Facial Action Coding system,has promising applications for a variety of industries.""

This new""software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Hung of a advanced science University and how he thinkes people and computers can communicate.

46d3d41,"according to the passage there is somthing call Facial Action Coding Smile . Can this be useful to school's ? Yes the reason why I say yes it's because some studets can understand some thing . And if they can understand it the computer could be able to under stand the assingment well . Also this can help see where is it the student struggles . And it can be a game changer for alot of school .

Some good things about the software are that know's if you force a smile by detecting the muscle in the face. For example if a student gets stuck on a question or the teacher is busy with the another student or if you dont feel like bothering the teacher the software could help . This program can help or notify the teacher if a student is stuggling and with what they each struggle . Because in some schools teachers can't find out what is wrong with some student . This can really become somthing great for the future generations by modfing the lesson for each student . For example if a student doesnt like the subject the program can detect that and make it funner . The reason why is because some students think some teachers teach boring things and with this program it can make the lesson funner .

In conclusion this software could really help out schools . By making students like school because some complaints I hear from some of my friends is that a certan teacher is boring or they can't make the lesson fun . So if the lesson is boring the camara can check the face the individual is making and modify the lesson . This program may also raise a generation of smart students if this where ever to happen . In the end I think this program could also make some teacher smile .",3
e128b78,"I whole-heartedly believe the United States should keep the electoral College because the people voting are more legit, the voters are more educated in government topics than most, and citizens still have a say in the vote. Some citizens need to realize that electing a president is a big deal. Electors have more knowledge than most citizens about those government choices and which is best for The United States. Just because it says a citizen is qualified to vote does not always mean that person is making the correct decision. The electoral college electors uses their votes on legit reasons and what can benefit their country.

Electoral College is the way to go because the people voting are more legit. These Electors see what the people who are running for president and vice president have to offer. If they feel it is more benefical than what the other president/vice president has to offer, they will vote for that president. Most citizens understand what the president and vice president is trying to do for their country but the other citizens who are only voting because they can, do not. These citizens still effect the elect of the president and vice president and that's why the electoral college is a must have.

Electors are usually more educated in government topics than most citizens. The electors are people from the House of Representatives and Senators also. For those Representatives and those Senators to get there, they study about the United States and it's government. When Presidents and Vice presidents state what they are willing to do for the country, those electors know if it is appropriate and necessary and which one makes more sense or benefits the country more than the other. Not that Citizens would understand the best choice for the country but more likely than not an electors would make a more educated choice than a citizen would.

Even though the electors are voting, Citizens vote still count and matter. Citizens vote for the elector who is voting for the president that the citizens wants to vote for. A citizen can vote for a certain amount of electors who pledged to vote for the desired President and Vice President. If those electors won the statewide election, that desired President and Vice president would get those certain amount of electoral votes. It all depends on the citizens to choose the electors and whoever gets the majority vote, gets the electoral votes.

In Conclusion, the electoral college definitely should stay and help choose the better President and Vice President. The electors have a more legit reason to their choice than most citizens voting, since the electors are based on Representatives and Senators, they are more educated in that government matter, and even though it is electoral votes, the citizens vote count and matter. Without the electoral college, citizens who voted for a president can lose because the people who voted for the other president didn't think about the advantage and disadvantage of that president. Even if it was the better choice, the president can have ideas that don't benefit the voter. Electoral college who be kept and help all citizens choice the more reliable President and Vice President.            ",4
5d78a33,"I agree that using the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom is valuable. New software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. This new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has promising applications for a variety of industries. First of all, it can reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored. It could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.

Secondly, The facial expressin for each emotion are universal. Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions.

Finally, Dr. Huang observes that artist such as da Vinci studied human anatomy help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

As you can see, the Facial Acton Coding System helps in the classroom.      ",1
c7a66e5,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author, starts by talking about how Venus is part of our solar system and some facts about the planet. They try to support thier ideas on studying Venus as a worthy pursuit and dangers by first listing the similarities it has with our earth and then transitions toward thier topic. The author explains very well, many times by using examples and facts to support their idea about how Venus is a worthy pursuit in the scinece field, but at the same time they also counter with the many dangers that are eminent.

First, the author describes the dangers with facts and statistics about Venus and the amosphere and how dangerous and harmful it is. Like in paragraph three, they stated ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide"" Which readers know is impossible for humans to survive under. Then they talk about the temperatures which is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The author does a really good job at then comparing the temperature on Venus with the temperature on earth by telling us that is is over 90 times greater than what is experienced on earth. Comparing is an effect way of making readers understand the difference and especially when it shows the numbers written all out. Then, they continue to support thier cause by talking about frequent natural disaster that cause havoc which some already excist on earth. This makes Venus looks so much more harmful and uninhabitable than it already did.

Later in the passage, they transition to the benefits of studying about Venus and it is a somewhat smooth transition since the aurthor has already set up thier claim in paragraph two by stating plenty of similarities between the earth and Venus so readers can get and understanding of Venus. So in paragraph four, when the author entered, it was very smooth with a question on why the scientists even bothered and they countered by answering the question which helped support the authors overall claim. Another thing that shows how well the author has supported the idea of Venus worth studying is they list more similarities like in paragraph four they talk about how Venus had similar features like ""valleys, mountains, and craters."" This gave readers a sense of imagery and later supports the imagery and landscape by giving a reason of why that is important like it is out nearest option for travel. This make the author sound much more credible.

Finally, in the article, the author supports both of thier ideas by talking about NASA and thier ideas on the space travel. Paragraph five and six help explain why traveling to Venus is so hard, but still so worthwhile. They state, that it is diffcult by listing the extreme conditions even if they were to get close and still survive. Then in paragraph six they list the risks and the sample and different pictures they could have taken but the dangers were too high. This helps show readers the real limit and possiblity at the same time.

Therfore, the author throughly explains thier idea and supported it very well with different techniques and different ways of explanation. The author has already done very well in adressing how traveling to Venus had its advantages but getting there and actually surviving the dangers is very hard. They did very well in explaining the dangers with facts and statistics. Then later also explained throughly with claims and backup information. This shows that this author was very prepared and supported thier idea exquisitely. ",5
94ea768,"Driverless cars are a new and upcoming thing in our world today. Drivers having to constantly steer and brake is a thing of the past. Now, cars drive themselves and humans are no more required to be the drivers, but the passengers. But many people don't believe that this is the road we should go down. Could going completely driverless put humans in even more danger than we are today? After reading the article, development of driverless cars should be stopped because they cause more crashes, prove technology is unreliable, and show that who to put at blame is unknown and will cause problems.

Development of driverless cars need to be stopped. These cars not only seem to not need human drivers, but means that we're in trusting these cars with our lives. Today, car accidents are a variety of reckless driving, simple mistakes, etc. But what they have in common is they're all accidents that humans have committed. In the article, paragraph 7, it says humans will be notified by the car when a situation gets too complicated or diffcult for it to handle. But by the time the car notifies the passenger, won't it be too late for the human to react and take over? Driverless cars putting us humans in situations like this will only cause panic for us, when we aren't even suppose to be driving, but passengers,

and cause even more crashes. Driverless cars don't need to be developed because they'll just put us in more danger than we're already in.

Technology is the main component these driverless cars utilize to actually be able to drive by themselves. In paragraph 5 it says, ""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on the individual wheels and reduce power from the engine..."" In our world today, technology and manufactured devices malfunction all the time. It's just what happens because humans don't know everything there is to know about everything. What if to say this happened to the sensors in the driverless cars. If the sensors just stop working, causing the car to stop, putting the passenger in a great amount of danger. Technology isn't reliable, so why should we have to rely on technology to drive our cars? It's just more danger being caused instead of being prevented if we develop these cars. We should rely on ourselves to drive our cars instead of technology because it can just malfunction at anytime, without a warning.

Directly in the article, in paragraph 9, it posed the question: ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a very important question because it's basically asking who's taking the blame if someone is injured by these driverless cars? This could all be avoided if we stop the development of those cars. Forsay, if someone's injured, would the guilt lie on the passenger who's suppose to be watching the driverless car drive or the manufacturers who made the car in the first place? Chaos and problems will arise if this situation takes place. Both people should be at fault though because they're giving technology the wheel and the path to do what it want, even if it's programmed to do one thing. But like I said before, these accidents and questioning who's at fault can be avoided if we take away what causing this all: technology. Stopping production of these cars will take the blame away and make accidents more clearer as who's to blame.

The idea of having driverless cars in our world today isn't not going to go away anytime soon, but proving why it shouldn't be develop and not even being an idea anymore can keep them from being a thing in our world to come. Driverless cars not only take the control out of the driver, but take control of the fate of the passengers' lives too. Development of driverless cars should be stopped because they cause more accidents, prove technology is unreliable, and cause questions of who's at fault for crashes. Taking driverless cars out of our streets and sticking to man-driven cars will make the world a safer place not only now, but for our future too. ",5
1fc46cb,"Why would scientist want to travel to one of the most hostile planets in the solar system? The author of ""The Challenge of Exporing Venus"" explains by listing the reasons why we should, listing the challenges, and saying possible solutions to those challenges.

So, why should we explore one of the solar systems most hostile planet? Well, the author explains that, at times, Venus is the closest planet to Earth. It is considered to be Earth's twin, because both planets have similar density and size. It also could have been the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. It has similar features geography such as valleys, mountains, and craters; scientists believe that, long ago, Venus was covered in huge oceans and could possibly support life.

This planet, that used to support life, is now hostile. The author tells the reader that the atmosphere of Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide, has sulfiric acid, and has an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's. The surface also has it's problems. The surface averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. There are also erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning striking the surface.

The best solution for these problems is a blimp-like vehicle. This vehicle would orbit 30 miles above Venus. It would avoid all of the surface's challenges. It would be cooler at about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure would be equal to Earth's sea level. This blimp would be solar powered and could possibly have simplified electronics made of silicone carbide. The author adds that simplified electronis will not be the only technology onboard, there is a chance that mechanical computers could make a comeback, as they are more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

The challenges scientists face have solutions, and the solutions can help scientists make new discoveries of a planet that remains unexplored. The author has explained why we should explore Venus, despite how dangerous the mission would be. They give the reader reasons why we should, such as possible life forms, and the author has more pros than cons. They also says solutions to the cons that scientists face.",3
f7b2044,"Do you think that you can tell people face expressions? Well if you can't right now i'm going to help you figure it out by the end of the essay. I think that it is good to use the technology to read the emotoinal expressioins on someones face. The reason i think this is beacuse maybe one student is sad and no one call tell that but maybe you can make them go from sad to happy just by talking to them. I can sometimes tell if someone is not felling happy or sad or just having a bad day.

In the start of paragraph four it says that we huamns perform this impressive ""calulation"" every day. I think that is very true about what it says. I think also that maby not everone can think that it is true but i belive it. The Mona Lisa demonstration it did bring a small smile on my face. Another good reason to have this is like what Huang said that it would recoginze someones face and it should tell the teacher if they are confused about that question.

I think that every thing that we use in this world that uses technology should be able to read your face emotional expression. In paragraph seven I think that its true that my home computer shouldn't be able to handle it. Also in paragraph seven it tell you to do face expressions and when i did it worked i was mad and then i was happy.

Everyone should try doing that and see if they like doing that.

So do you fell like you could tell someones emotions by me explanning it? I know that i fell like I can tell someones emotions right of the bat. I hope at least some of you know how to tell someone face expressions but if not its fine. did you have fun reading this. That is my support with doing it.   ",2
902eca4,"Although venus is referred to as the evening star, it is still a planet. Venus is one of the brightest planets and, you can easily see it on a dark knight. Researchers say thet venus is hard to examine because oh how bright it is and, how close it is to the sun.

The author states than venus is the closest plant to earth because of the density and size of it. Many people say that it's the closest planet to us however, every planet spins around at a different speed so one might appear closer than another. NASA has sent several spacecrafts to venus and its referred to as the most difficult planet to land on. Every spacecraft that's ever landed there has never made it back due to the enviroment and, the rough surface.

The author says that venus is almost all carbon dioxide and, its covered with corrosive sulfuric acid. He also states that venus is almost 800 degrees and, its extreme to what we experience on our own world. Venus is the hottest planet in solor system although, mercury is closer to the sun. Astronomers find venus so fascinating because it's the closest earth like planet in the solar system.

Astronomers also say that venus could have well been filled with large oceans and, could have supported many forms of life. Venus is very similar to earth because, it has rock textures such as valleys, mountains, and craters as to earth. NASA is eager to go back to venus to study the earth like planet. The author says that they are planing to have an aircraft that will hover 30 miles over the surface that will make it safe. Allowing them to do this will lower the temperature to around 170 degrees, but also the air preasure would be about the same to sea level on earth.

Although, hovering over venus would be safe, they would still find many challenges. Without them being on the ground they won't be able to take samples of rock, minerals, and gasses. NASA is wondering its they can make there equipment better to take on the challenge, and to see what venus is compared to earth. NASA will also have to come up with a way to make their equipment lighter, and also be able to last for the time period they are on venus. Modern technology is rather delicate than to the mechanical computers they used in world war 2.

Although its a struggle to experience venus, it also has a big impact on earth. Being able to see what venus is allows us to find new materials and gases that we have never heard of before. This could be a big impact to us. It could help us find new ways to create materials, and to better our everyday lives. ",2

With that in mind, there are several ways into limiting car usage. Some envole not getting a drivers license. some evolve banning car usage on specific days.

In the first source it talked about how german residennts given up there car's. And this new district forbides the idea of street parking and home garages and driveways. So what this community is showing is that there starting a new trend to get other countries envolved in this idea to start limiting car usage and green house gasses. Car ownership is allowed in that community, but you would have buy a space in a large garage's for $40,000 along with a house.

In the third source, in Bogota Colombia millions of columbians started to hike bike skate and or take the bus to avoid traffic jams. Bogota has been continuing the ban of NO cars excluding buses and taxis for three years. The reason why they did this is to promote an alternative for transportation and to reduce smog. People who don't follow this will pay a fine for $25.

In conclusion the idea on limiting car usage will benifit you in a good way. You won't have to spend thousands of dollars on a car. It will help preventing more green house gases. And it will help reduce the number of people who drive a car. So who knows when the world will change their minds of driving and owning a car we will not until we incounter something that would change the environment's or even the world.                   ",3

The theorists wanted to know proof that it wasn't alien made. So April 5,1998 the Global Surveyor flew over the face and took a picture ten times shaper than the first picture. Thus you could see that the face was formed not by aliens but by natrual formation.

The theorists where still not happy about the photo take. On the that day mars had a dust strom that day so the picture kinda had a haze to it. So the mission controllers had to prepare to take another picture. So they did and on April 8, 2001 on a cloudless day on mars the picture was took.

Once agian the picture showed that there were no alien houses or monuments. The picture was taken with absolute maximum resolition. So you could see every little detail on mars. Scientists concluded that the formation was made by lava coming to the surface and making a formation that just happend to look like a face mage by aliens.",3

Unmasking the Face on Mars is talking about how some people discused how it was created by aliens and other scientist just say it is a natural landform and i agree.

May 24 2001 tenty five years ago NASAs space craft found a shadowy likeness of a human face . Scientist believe that it is a natural based lanform called a Martian messa common enough around Cydonia . A few days later NASA unveiled it for all to see. Now few scientist think their is an alien artifact, but they are wrong.

As soon as word got out on April 5th 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time.

They snaped a picture ten times sharper than the originak viking photo . Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for the JPL website to show the picture scientist revealed the picture as a natural landform there was no alien monument after all , stated in paragraph 7 .

There was no evidence of there ever being an alien just a historical landform that was a familiar to a humans face . But people were still not satisfied about the research . What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or messa lanform not an alien or artifact .",2

4e5ee4a,"Imagine being in a driverless car and the car turing against you and crashing. That is the exact reason why I am aganist driverless cars. I feel like driverless cars are dangerous, unreliable, and not affordable. This article made me feel like it is even more unsafe than I orginally thought. I feel like it is unsafe for people to be in a car that does not have a driver, because of it's limited abilities and how little technology there is for it.

I think that having a driverless car is dangerous because of its limited abilities. The article said that driverless cars can not navigate through work zones and around accidents or pull in and out the driveway. If the person in the driver seat were to fall asleep at the wheel or be completely distracted how would vibrating their chair and flashing light get their attention. The technology could malfunction and that is extremely dangerous. Imagine being in the passenger seat going 60 MPH on a highway and you have a gaming device or are watching TV in your car, and then out of no where you wrecked into something else. You had no warning or no advisery that you were in a dangerous situation because that technology failed you and just caused a crash. The only solution that could possibly work is for manufactures to have cameras in the car watching the driver that is a positive. It could also be a negative based off of how it is a invasion of privacy. The smart roads would help in these situations but would cost to much money so it's practially eliminated.

Having a driverless car is plain out unreliable. If everyone has a driverless car the roads would be filled with computers and technology controlling every move and turn on the roads. Just one thing could go wrong and there could be a serveral car accidet or someones life could just have been taken. What if the steering starts acting up and it can stay in the right lane and another car has a driver who isn't paying attention then they collide. All that happened just because a car steering started messing up. Something even worse could happen for example the brakes stop working. Imagine going the speed limit down the street but someone was speeding and just got in a accident right in front of you. The seats start vibrating so you wake up and see the situation in time and try to hit the brakes and it didn't work. That would've caused another accident based off of it's unreliability with its technology. The coordination system could mess up and you end up somewhere completely off target then what you were expecting to be. All the unpredictable factors that make driverless cars unpredictable just overweight the postives of a car driving you because you don't feel like driving.

It could be to expensive for everyone to get a self driving car. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have self driving cars by 2020. The question is will be able to afford the car or be able to pay the insurance. Most cars are expensive but afforadble over a course of years because you pay a monthly payment. Imagine buying this brand new self driving car and then crashing it even though it wasn't your fault and you already went broke trying to pay for it. How would you even be able to pay for it to get fix, the thing is you would not be able too. It might be to expensive for the average person.

I think it just is not smart to have self driving cars on the roads. It is to hazardest for people to mainly rely off of it when anything could go wrong. They are trying to make it more safe by putting in cameras, or vibrating seats, and entertainment to keep you away. That's all positive stuff but that doesn't mean it is realistic. There is no promise that any of that could do what it is expected to do. I think we should just stick to people driving cars for a better and safer driving experience on the road. It's to dangerous, and unreliable, and potenially to expensive for the average person. Let's let humans do the driving and stop having technology run our lifes. ",5
354da5c,"America would be a better place if there were no vehicles. Americans could walk wherever they go, instead of sitting down and riding/driving there. With much extra walking time, we would probably lose a lot of weight and get healthy or healthier than some already are. America has the largest percentage of obese citizens, more than any other country in our world. With the loss of vehicles we could change that.

Not many people realize this, but vehicles and any kind of chair is a lot of the reason why Americans are so obese. We sit down for every thing that we do. We sit in the car, at school, at work, at home, etc. If everyone walked to their destination they would burn calories and fat. Just getting rid of vehicles would make a dramatic change in the amount of obese people. Researchers suggest that obesity is caused mainly by laziness, and vehicles bring that suggestion to life.

All I'm tryin to say is that if we get rid of vehicles then Americans would not be so fat because they would actually have to get up off of their lazy butts and walk to a restaurant or grocery store to go get their food.    ",2
e9712e9,"I am against driverless cars because if you dont want to have the responsibility to drive a car you shouldnt have one. Im also against it because the car could do something you dont want it to. the main point is you shouldnt have a car if you dont want to control it in that case you might as well ride a bus or airplane.

Also it would cost alot of money you would have to buy certain types of streets anfd that would mess up other cars. You would have to upgrade the roads frequently. But most importantly I wouldnt want smart cars because they maybe would cause alot of accidents they could run red lights stop signs. Driverless cars are also not good because you could be on your cellphone and accidently take control and you dont know. It is also bad because that means the people in cars won't wear seatbelts and if they get in a car crash the are going to get hurt.     ",1
09e4fce,"Dear Senator,

The Electoral College is the best proven method for electing the president and produces great results, so it should be kept. It does have its mistakes, and faults, but who or what in the world does not? Many people do not favor this method of election, and argue that:""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."",these people may be right, but for the many past presidents that it has successfully elected, either for the good or bad, we the people are the main power for it. The electoral college does not just elect the president by itself, it works on what the people elect.

The reason that many people do not favor the electoral college is that they feel insecure knowing that they aren't voting for the president directly, just for electors who are voting for their chosen presidential candidate. It is all a phsycological insecurity for those who haven't gotten used to the fact that they don't have a direct power over what they want for the well-being of the government and the citizens. Also the fact that their are flaws in this method of election gets people nervous about a disaster happening, mainly because a mistake has happened before. ""In 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, recieving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266."" Bradford Plumer is very against the electoral college because of its past misgivings, or mistakes, and does not trust what it might do in the future.

The electoral college may possess many past mistakes and close runs, but it works unlike any other system of election that has been thought of. It produces very certain outcomes and results, the college selects all of the votes,sorts them, and releases the correct amount of votes for the president voted for. It is the least stressful, clearest, and fairest procedure for electing the president while at the same time being fair to all of the average people voting for their desired president. Because of all of the benefits that it promises, and the outcome for every voter, this fantastic method of election should be continued at least until a better method for choosing the president of the United States is discovered, and confirmed to be superior to our current system now.    ",3
59244d5,"I believe that the election for our president of the United States should be chosen by popular vote and not by some random people we don't know. If I wanted to have someone to be in charge of what goes on where I live I would want to have a say on who should be in charge. I think that if a popular vote wasn't the determining factor in whom won the election; then that person didn't really win the election.

in the election of 2012 Barack Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Mitt Romney. the amount of electoral votes should not determine which of the nominees will win the election i should be whomever receives the majority of popular votes. in the election of 2000 Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, he received 271 electoral vote compared to Gore's 266 electoral votes.

There are many people who travel to vote for our president and it would not be fair to them if their votes didn't really matter because someone else made the final decision. If our president isn't chosen by the citizens of the united states then the person that was chosen by unfair terms and bias choices isn't really the president of the united states; but is truly the president of the men and/or women in the electoral college who chose he or she.

The president should be chosen fairly by a just and unbiased vote cast by the people of the united states. Only then is it truly fair and right to the citizens of the United States to call that man or woman our president!            ",2
ac0b9fe,"Electoral college should go away. electoral college is unfair. each party picks a slate of electors,although it only takes trust to pick that elector it is unfair because it is what the people want. there are 4 reaons why electoral college shouldnt be used today. one may be that votes arent from people and votes are only elected by the electors,and the polular vote most likley always win. which means that people vote for the elector and the highest votes from one state to the elector,the president now has that state and now has votes from it. this is why ecltoral college shouldnt be used today. it is unfair that we cant vote for our own president and the electors get to choose.

one reason why electoral college is bad for the people is because of the thing called disastor factor. this is a bad affect to the voting. this happen in 1960 and was with John F. kennedy. what happen was the state legislatures are technically responsible for the electors and that the electors could always tell the people what they want. this was a key factorbut,what to fiasco did he helped changed everything. and here to today we still use electoral college. although we still use fiasco method it is getting better but still is a disastor and i think we should just make something that the people want. this woild be better and maybe an easier way to choose a president.

another unfair subject that electoral college does for voting is the prospect of tie ,this is a method in which only states with a certain amount of people allowed to vite. this is an unfair method because, for example hawaii has only a little amount of people and cant vote. also many other states cannot vote because of there population. this is very unfair and should be stopped. every state should be able vote. and again there is only one vote for each state and this method should be voted by state but by people to get a better examnation of what people want. since each state only cast one vote it is the senates job to pretty much vote for the elector. we should let the people vote the people vote themsleves so there is a more accurate vote,than just a single vote for the whole state.

another reason why the electoral college is unfair is because of the winner takes it all method in each state. this is a very unfair method because i do agree that every state should be able to vote. it doesnt matter if the state only has a population of twenty. every state should be able to vote for preseident, esspecially if you are old enough to vote. it is only fair. there are states such as rhode island and south carolina that are too small and other 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to vote. this is unfair . the system should start letting at least every state vote.

these are reasons why electoral college shouldnt be used today,this is a very unfair way of voting. forget the electoral college method and just start letting the people vote. yes it might hard to keep track but this way, if you let the people vote they will know what the people want and it would be much more accurate than saying one vote for each state . they should really take time thinking of ways to make this better and fair. because electoral college isnt fair at all. they should abolish electoral college from the united states. go back to directed elections. bob dole was someone who said that they shouldnt allow this, and i certainly agree that electoral college shouldnt be allowed.

cb7e33d,"My Opinion on Facial Action Coding System

I would have to disagree with what the article is saying. Ok i get that technology is everything nowadays but this is a little to far. You might program it to have emotions,but its hard for the software to know what the person is feeling and understand how they feel. Its easy for a person to connect with another person because thats how they feel. Humans can usually give one another help and advice because they most likely have been through it themselves.

Its easy for a person to help and understand it because they understand the emotion that is happening to them. But when you just program something to have emotions its not the same. These people are writing emotional things and want people who understand that. It is very hard for a piece of software to understand that. If I had to write something very personal i would want someone who can relate to read it.

But it could be a good thing for the school because it could help the school know if the kid was upset or bad. The school could help the kid and figure out whats wrong. In paragraph 9 they gave you examples on good ways to tell if someone means the smile on there face. It has some pros but there are alot ot cons to it.

This article has alot of good points in it but I still dont agree with what it is saying. Science can be a good thing but I dont think science can be used and be helpful in this situation. Plus it uses the schools money and it can be used for better things. We can use our time and think of things and that would be useful.

In conclusion i think that this is useless. I totally disagree with what there saying and doing. Technology is soon going to be everything and we dont want that. Its like soon we are going to be run by robots. I just think we can use our time worrying about other things. I dont think this will help us at all in the future. ",3
17eb73a,"The Facial Action Coding System or FACS, in my opinion could be very helpful and useful in the future. The reason I say this is because, there are many students that get very bored, very unamused, confused and irritated with school work. And if we were able to have The Facial Action Coding System, it could possibly help students get back on track very easily.

In the text I read about how The Facial Action Coding System was able to, ""calculate emotions"". And like I said I think this could be very beneficial to students and adults in the Educational Field and the Work Field. For example, in the text it says, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This shows that the FACS is following your mood, so whatever mood you have the following ad will appear. This could be the beginning of participation. In addition, they also say that a classroom computer could detect or recognize when a student is becoming bored, confused, or unamused, according to Dr. Huangs prediction. They also say, ""It could be an effective human instructor."". This could be very effective on students and teachers. I say this because, if a student is bored or confused an ad that pops up could help them realize some things and help put them on track and hopefully get interested.

""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too."" according to Dr. Huang. This not only is efficient for students or teachers but, it is also beneficial to Surgeons. This technology is valuable and very useful it seems. The Facial Action Coding System is, a human emotion identifier or detector and this would be very useful to a classroom of students. And others.   ",3

415f088,"The world of technology is rapidly increasing. Along with this comes new inventions. One invention in particular is the driverless car. This car has both positive and negative affects on society. However, the driverless car is not safe and could be bad idea.

The driverless car could potentionally be a great thing. For example, this would be a fun or new way to drive and you could have in-car enterntainment. These cars can brake, accelerate, and even steer by themselves. Many people see this as a dream, but in reality it's a lot of pointless work.

At this point, driverless cars are not fully driverless. These cars need a human operator to get in and out of driveways, navigate through traffic and construction, and to go around accidents. The driver never really gets a break from driving like they would expect. The driver must remain alert while sitting in the car because the car is uncapable of doing everything itself. Some companies even stated that they would place cameras in the car to ensure that a driver is paying attention to the road. Not only is this an invasion of privacy, but it is unethical and strange. Another reason as to why this would not be a good idea is because all traffic laws would have to change regarding the use of driverless cars, and new laws would have to be written and enforced. An issue with this is figuring out who would be responsible in the case of an accident. This would either be the driver, or the manufacturer of the vehicle.

All in all, the driverless car would have to be a lot more updated if it was ever in full use. There are many problems with this idea, involving accidents, new laws, privacy, and the idea of still having to pay full attention. Many people would expect a whole new way of driving, but really the only thing a person would change is not steering and braking the entire time. ",4

If the student was at their family doctor and the docor wanted to cheak for anxiety or depression that tool would be perfect in that line of work but do you really think that the schools should have acees to this, i don't.

First off it takes the fun out of driving. Secondly its dangerous.

To begin with driverless cars take the fun out of driving. No one wants to sit inside of a car and do nothing. Getting your driving liscense is like a new found freedom, how would you feel if immediatley after getting your liscense instead of driving yourself you were getting drove around? no one would want that. which is why i am against driverless cars

Also driverless cars are dangerous. They are ran by computers which from time to time do malfunction. Companys are putting entertaintment features in the car which distarcts the driver if he needs to take over the wheel. Another point brought up in the essay is that whos to blame when the driverless car runs into another car. An incident of that nature would cause the blame game. manufacture wouldn't take credit and neither would the driver or should i say copilot. Also computers can be hacked. Say the president was in a driverless car and someone wanted him dead it would be very easy for them to hack his car and send him off a cliff.

They could use it to see if the suspect is lying by if his face shows worry, fear, surprise, anger or discust. All of those feelings and emothions could be helpful and valuable to figure out a case.

In a classroom, it would be a lot less useful. It would be cool tool to show students and things like that. They could learn how to use it and understnad how it was put together in science class.

dc2143b,"Throught the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. The developement for these cars would not be such a great idea to make. Producing vehicles with such improvements can cause many bad problems to surface in court and society as a whole. The reasoning behind these improvements being negative is safety of people. Peoole should to look at the things that might go wrong before they support something that sounds good.

Technology is a major factor in todays society and we use it everyday in life, but if the technology we have sold to us has issues then it should not be sold to the people until the issue is completely resolved. If the driverless cars are manufactured and sold to people and there is a problem within the cars which causes them to make mistakes and have technical issues. The manufacturers are not just putting the people riding the car at risk, they are putting the lives innocent pedestrians at risk also. There is a point made in the article where it states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or manufacture?"". The point being made from this specific sentence is that if the cars are opperating by themselves and if something happens to anyone the only person to blame is the creator of the vehicle, the manufacturer. In most states it is illegal to test computer driven cars because of the dangers that are most likely to occur. In the article we are introduce to a statement which says,""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human in control at all times"". This statement is saying that if a human has control then everything should be fine. These are overall reasonings and explinations for why driverless cars should not be manufactured.

Manufacturing driverless cars would not be a great idea to make for peoples overall safety. The cars would be unsafe to people as a whole and cause major issues in court as for lawsuits. As of making new and better improvements to vehicles would be a good idea. People should just stick to driving themselves places its the safest way to get there.",3
eea7ec8,"To agree, or to not agree. I am all for the idea of driverless cars. Just knowing I would be safe in a car can manage itself and not worry about being in a wreck makes me feel better about the idea. There are a lot of people who tend to be reckless drivers in the world and we can not be having that knowing there are people with families and children risking their life to drive around. I know how often recks happen in the world and plenty of people die due to examples like drunk driving. To have a car that can drive itself would be a great idea.

There are already cars that, somewhat, control themselves. For example, the vibrating of the seat to let us know if we will run into something while backing out of a parked area. Or the automatic breaking when it senses a wreck in motion. Over time, creaters are becoming more advanced in coming up with ideas for the cars they are developing. They plan on making driverless cars already but they still have to gradually get to that point.       ",2
5cdea24,"The use of technology indicated in a classroom of students is valuable. It'd be very useful to a teacher. Their job would be easier since they'd comprehend their students better.They'd know more well how to explain everything they need to.

First, what if a student was mad because they got irritated that they didn't understand anything...but they also don't want to ask for help? If the teacher realizes, he/szhe would be more patient/flexible and try to help. Not yell and embarass them or anything. The student wouln't get such a low score because of the effort that was given.

Then, a student's grandma, etc. could've died, or that person could be the victim olf a bully. That person would be extremely sad.It just plainly wouldn't be their day. Also, they would'nt like to get bugged in their feelings moments. A teacher noticing could prevent terrible things like suicide.

Next, a student can also be a little too hype. They could get seperated from their friends for focus. Plus the teacher could even blame someone else for them being talkative. Less conflict would evolve. In paragraph 1 for example, it gave us the exact percentage of each emotion felt by the Mona Lisa.

Finally, I conclude this technology can help us read others better. We'd save all the questions w'd make. Time is valuable, and so are our peers.   ",3
8b1dddc,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" talks about Venus a lot and how it's very alike to planet, and Venus has the hottest temperature, and lastly how the NASA is setting up ideas to send humans to learn more about Venus. It is also trying to persuade us to learn more about Venus and how interesting it is. The author's tone is very curous and is very into it.

Venus has similarites to earth that are even called ""twins"" and even in the text it says ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of denisty and size, and occasionally the closet in distance too.""

which means that they may not be the same hight which is the same size but they still have some similarties that they share. Venus as well share the same similarites by how Venus has ""erupting volvanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes"" it has powerful storms just like Earth. Another reason for how Venus and Earth are alike is by how Venus also the surface of ""rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" it's amazing how they both have so may alikes. Lastly Venus has also been covered with oceans and supported varius forms of life just like earth. Earth has been through that as well. How it was covered with water that happened years ago not not and i'm talking about Venus.

Venus has one of the hottest surface temperature than any of our solar system like how the text says. It also says how the temperature is different here in Earth than in Venus. It says "" temeperatures avarage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" which means is bad for us to breath in Venus. Therefore the oxygen from Venus is highly different from Earth. Lastly the temeperature is extremely bad that it can crush a ""submarnine accustomed to diving to the deeepest parts of out oceans and would liqefy many metals."" which means that it is very horrible for us.

My last reason is NASA is giving out ideas to send humans to Venus. In paragrapgh 5 it talks about they are trying to send humans to Venus but also there's bad things can happen. Like in the last sentence it says ""Not easy conditictons, but survivable for humans."" throughout that whole paragrapgh it is saying that tempatures would still be 170 degrees Fahrenheit and how the sea level is close to earth. In paragrapgh 6 in the middle it is talking about how researches can't take rocks or anyhting from Venus because it is a risk. That's why it's a challenge.

These are my reasons for how Earth and Venus has a lot of commen things and Venus doesnt have a lot of dangers. Also Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.          ",4
99ae33c,"The united states has this ellection system called the electoral collage. The electoral collage is a system of voting for verious comities. When the founding fathers of The united states made the constitution the electoral collage was a part of it.

Why would any one want to change the electoral collage because i would like to know. In my oppinion in is the best thing i know of for a working government. Over the years there has been a larg number of amendments to the constitution, but that was to adjust it to the chang in todays tecnology. Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is theated like a state for purposes of the Electoral collage.

The electoral collage consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorsvotes is required to elect the President. Most states have a ""winner-take -all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. So another words whoever gets the most votes wins but the odds are which ever side has the larger amount of people voting republican or democrat is normaly who wins. because if your a republican your most likly to vote democrat.

Everything that is rong with the electoral collage. Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you'd vote for slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry.    ",1
26983cf,"In this article, ""The Challene of Exploring Venus"", the author is explaining the difficulties of researching Venus closer, and why it is near impossible due to the challenges the planet provides. The author states what challenges the planet poses, and how scientists are trying to overcome those challenges. The author also says why the planet is worth the risk of exploration. The author supports the claim that Venus is a worthy persuit for exploration, disregarding the dangers, because Venus has many similar geological structures and could have once supported life due to the planet's simularities to Earth, but the author doesn't provide much more evidence as to why it is a worthy persuit.

In the same paragraph, a few lines down, the author gives examples of the similar features of terrain that the two planets share. The author says that, ""Venus has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" The author means to that the planet has simlar geological features, in the next line the author expands upon what those are. The author states, ""The planet has a surface of sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Through these two sentences from the article the author is contributing to reasons why exploration on the planet Venus is worth it, despite the natural dangers that the planet poses. The fact the two planets share similar physical characterists appeals the claim the author made about Venus being Earth's sister planet.

In the fourth paragraph the author gives a few reasons as to why scientists are further discussing the exploration of the planet Venus. The author says that Venus is the most Earth-like planet in the solar system, and it may have housed life at one point. In the second line of the paragraph, the author states, ""Austronomers are facinated by Venus because it may once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This peice from the article shows that researchers, or astronomers, are intrigued by Venus because of it's simularities with Earth. Then the author goes into more detail about what those simularites are, in the same paragraph he states, ""Venus was probably convered largely with oceans and could have supported varius forms of life, just like Earth."" In this sentence the author expands upon what those simularites are, and how the planets are similar because of their attributes, such as the support of different life forms. The detail the author inserted into the article about the resemblance of oceans is significant because life is not possible without oceans, and Venus had them.

Both peices of evidence that support what claims the author made as to why research into Venus was a good idea came from the same paragraph. The other seven paragraphs of the article expand upon why exploration isn't possible, how scientists and researchers are trying to overcome the difficulties that the planet provides them with, and what dangers there are. Only one paragraph from the article supports why exploration is intriguing to scientists. In this paragraph, the author supports why exploration towards Venus is being chased, such the similar physical characterists and the possiblity of life. The author doesn't support that idea of further exploration to Venus adequetly because they don't provide enough claims. There are two statements supporting why scientists are facinated by Venus. Why studying Venus is a worthy persuit is a minor detail in the article, the author does not do a well enough job in supporting the motivations behind the scientists.         ",5
f0fbb9f,"Is the Electoral College fair or not, thats is was many people are trying to figure out. The Electoral College is a process of votes that allows people to choose a president, but some contries get to vote and some dont even see a campaign ad. I believe the Electoral College is not a fair process because under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president, also the winner-takes-all system doesn't rely on the states that have no chance of winning but relies on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

There are many things wrong with the Electoral College that can ruin the vote system for a long time. According to Source 2, under the Electoral College the voters dont even get to vote for the candidate they want, but have to vote to a slate of electors which is unfair. Voters sometimes cannot contol who they vote for so voters sometimes get confused and vote for the wrong candidate. It depends on the state to pick the slate of electors on state conventions, or even by presidential candidates themselves.

The winner-takes-all syestem can be very unfair to some states who want to vote for a candidate. The winner-takes-all system is unfair because the candidates dont spend time on those states that have no chance of winning, but relies on the states that can win. 17 states including  Rhode Island and North Carolina dont even get to see the candidate because they are states that have no chance of winning. Also 25 large media markets dont even get to see a campaign ad because the candidates dont bother to but one up. The fate of the presidency is in the hands of a few voters in ohio which is just unfair to other states.

I believe that the Electoral College is unfair because they have done many wrong things that can effect other states and the vote system for a very long time.              ",3

e603fea,"Do you think it would be easier for technology to do the work for the teachers and identifying their face expressions during lessons? Some think it would be better ways for humans and computers to communicate. This could be a big step for the future.

In my attention getter or introduction, Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming comfused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" This shows that someone somewhere can be inventing something like this to help students in the future and can also upgrade technology into a better cause.

Facial Action Coding System also knows as FACS has been invented by Dr. Paul Eckmen, ""The process begins with the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"" (D'Alto paragraph 6). This just shows the way it works and how it has to be human muscle movements, Eckman has also classified six basic emotions which are happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

Overall, the value of technology should be for a better cause and can help many people in different ways such as students by looking at their facial expressions on a teacher's lessons if they don't understand the topic. This is another way it can change to computers and humans to communitcate.",2
4d6c690,"Facial action coding system is a system that is able to tell emotions on the faces of anyone who gets scanned by it. They're classified by: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

For a student, a facial action coding system, to be able to tell your emotions is probably something that most students do not want. It would probably make most students uncomfortable for a machine to watch their faces to be able to tell what they're feeling. But in a teachers way of seeing this. It can prove valueable to help him or her out with the student and teach them in a certain way that makes the student feel happier or they figure out whats wrong with the student.

Some evidence for this is. ""A classroom coputer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" They could then modify the lesson for the student and provide more focus in a certain area. Say the studnt was confused and the teacher never knew he was confused because he never really showed it to the teacher. Well this system can do that and be able to tell the teacher that he needs help.

In the end Facial Action Coding System is a great way to help out teachers and make their job a little easier to be able to improve their lessons and make the student smarter. But students like my self wouldn't want a machine to watch them, while im doing their work, and tell the teacher what they're feeling. It would make the student want to hide their emotions even more. Plus you wouldn't want the teacher to know what you're feeling because you could get in trouble if its something bad.          ",3
195769a,"Dear Senator,

I am writing this letter to discuss the Electoral College. I have read some interesting facts about the Electoral College and I believe changes need to be made. The people of the United States of America should be in control of who is elected. It should not just be a group of people from each state that is allowed to pick.

I am not the only one that feels this way. In the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College:

Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it says, ""According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortley after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""

It is wrong to have the people vote for people to vote for the president. If someone wants a certain president to be elected, but they don't know who the electors are going to vote for then how do they know which elector to vote for? In the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" under the ""What's wrong with the electoral college column"" it says, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.""

In conclusion, I say abolsih the electoral college! I am not the first person to say that either.

Bob Dole also said""Abolish the electoral college!"" It is not a fair system to use. There is plenty of evidence to show that the majority of the American people are against the electoral college.                     ",3
5440f90,"On May 24,2001, something very interesting happened on Mars. About twenty five years ago a space craft took a photo of the land, that looked like a human face. This picutre was take by NASA's Viking one spaceship. It happened to be taking these photos to find places for the Viking two spacecraft to safely land. When it came arcross this uncommon sight it snapped a picture.

When the image appeared on the monitor most of NASA were surprised at the image that lied before them. Scientist soon figured out that it was just a Matian mesa. Which happened to be very common around Cydonia. Most people argue saying that this could be a sign that there use to be life on Mars.

When NASA revealed the image for everyone to see, people started to think it wasn't just another rock or land marking. People saw the face and thought aliens were found on Mars. Although, that wasn't the case. Only a few scientist thought the Face was an alien artifact. The other scientist thought it was just something like a rock that happened to look like a face, because of the shadows.

After a lot of research another spacecraft was sent to Mars on September ninteen ninty-seven. Eighteen years after the photo of the Face was taken by the Viking one. The Face was then photograph again, so that it could be examined more closely. ""On April 5,1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time,Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture tentimes sharper that the original Viking photos.""

Thousands of excited people were waiting for the image. ""It first appeared on the JPL wedsite,revealing... a natural landform."" There was no sign of anything Alien about the photo. Therefore, it was not an alien aftifact after all.

Many people were unsatisfied. They claimed that since the picture of the Face was taken in a cloudy area it might explain why no one saw life in the first place. Scientist took this theory into thought. Mission controllers stated another spacecraft to send again.

On April 8,2001, it happened to be a cloudless day in Cydonia. Scientist took action. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. What the picture actually showed ""is the Martian equivalant of a butte or mesa- landforms common aroung the American West. Garvin a man who was leading this expedition says, ""'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated messa about the smae height as the Face on Mars."" There fore the face on Mars was not a sign of Alien life. ",3

After reading this story/argument i think we should remove the Electoral college, why? Because i think we shoud be able to have the final vote, not the electoral voters. It states in paragraph 15 that ""it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" ""when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" (paragraph 15) the reason why is cause they vote on the more who has the responsibility on taking part as president.

The electoral college has 538 electors and about 270 electoral vote are required to elect president. There is one member of the house in your state of representatives also 2 for your senate. But in the district of columbia therenis allocated 3 electors that are treated like a state. This election is held every four yearson the Tuesday after the first Monday of November. So when you vote, you dont vote for the whivh presidnt your actualy voting for the candidtes electors.

""It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win national popular vote. But in the year 2000, Gore had more popular votes then Bush,and Bush had less fewer electoral votes.

That only happened cause the elctoral votes made it happen. some informstion i put up there is to inform you what they do and how many votes are required to elect president compared to the thousands of people voting for the president.

But on the other hand, we will get in our car and drive just to go to the store within a mile from our home. We should just walk. Limiting cars just might be the right idea.

Car accidents, Hit-and-runs and all types of other indcidents with cars are a big stresser. Walking is much safer if you take the right precautions. You can get the exercise you need without the hassle of going on Weight Watcher or Jenny Craig. Just put the keys down for a day and walk!

""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""(Source 3) Limit cars, limit stress and limit the pollution that is hurting our eco system.

However, there still is a question unanswered: how will we get to the place we need to go thats not in walking distance? Limiting cars may save our ecosystem, but some people have to get to and from work or the doctor that is not in walking distance. For example, each day, my mom has to get to work in Tampa,FL. She has to take the expressway to get to where she is going. So what is she suppose to do? Walk? No. But on the better side of things, she can always take the bus or car-pool with her co-workers. Theres alway a better way to stop the pollution and save the ecosystem.

This shows that we can all come together and do something positive for our fellow Americans and Mother Earth.

Limiting cars have more good advantages than disadvantages. We have to save the world from harmful thing. Limiting cars limits the time and money of people. Thats why when you limit cars, you limit stress. So take a walk and save the world!            ",3

For a classroom i think it is very valuable. I think it is valuable, because teachers and other staff members can use the information to change the way they teach. They could also use it as a way to change the way they behave to students. For example if there is a teacher doing his/hers usual lesson, and the students find this teachers way of instructing/teaching very boring. The instructor could use this information, and change the way they do things in the classroom. Maybe the teacher is not very energetic and very bland at talking. Maybe their assignments are too difficult and/or confusing. The information will let the teacher know that the students are bored and aren't paying attention or confused, and then he could use that information as an advantage to spice up the lesson, or change the assignment. As it says in paragraph 6, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Not only could we use the technology for learning purposes only, but for a student/teachers mental well-being also.

This technology could also used by detecting if a student is going through tough times. The technology can pick it up with the students facial expressions, and it could take note and inform the staff at the school. If the emotions are constant (I say constant because everyone has their bad days) maybe the student is depressed, or having problems at home or school even, and the technology can pick it up and inform the school. From there the school could get help for the student, or talk with them.

All in all I think that there are a lot of benefits to computers reading emotional expressions at school. It could benefit the learning environment, and also a student/teachers mental stability. Also im sure that there are many more reasons than that. I think that this can be something to look more for in the future and expand and improve more upon it.",4

Telling whats their emotions is good for us because we can be there for them when they feeling down.

Each expression is compared against a neutral face that shows no emotion. You can tell how someone is feeling simply by looking at their face. Most of us have trouble at describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried,etc. Human anatomy is to help the painting to facial muscles precisely to convey specific emotions. A classroom computer could recongize when somebody is becoming bored or confused.

They could indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but can even help to produce them.

Now according to the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is says that a NASA is going to have to send a person and in a type of ship that would flot above the Venus. however; Venus has a blanket type layer on its atmosphere which would only limit the researchers. ""Researchs cannot take samples of rock, gas or anything from a distance. therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorouh mission to understand Venus would need a up close and personal despite the risk."" What this piece of evidence is saying is that from a far view nothing can be really done, this would require a upclose and more personal experice.

A mission that would require those types of standards would maybe cause a lot of damage to a human being. Venus is mostly composed of carbon dioxied, 95%, and is air pressure is extreme, 90x, let not talk about Venus temperatures, 800 degrees.

All of this reaseach can lead us to new experinces and new discoveries, however; this is really high risk that NASA is taking. Venus can do stuff unexpected and maybe lead this into major disaster. NASA also states that they have other people using old technology to go to Venus and explore. WWII is he type of technology that they are using to explore on to the bright planet.

61cd246,"Do you ever dream of going to Venice, Italy, ""a city with streets of water"", or tour a ""excavated castle in Crete or marvel at the Panama canal on your way to China""?

The UNRRA started hiring ""Seagoing Cowboys"" at the end of World War II. These ""Cowboys"" helped haul animals across the ocean to help with their food supply. Once Luke Bomberger had hauled ""335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them."" It's an amazing experience that many people would love.

First of all, being on board across the ocean meant ways to pass time. ""Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animnals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games helped pass time.""

Secondly, you get to see amazing places all over the world. As I said at the beginning, Luke got to wittness the trips through Venice, Italy and a castle in Crete. ""I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, so was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Last but not least, you get to help the people by sending them food. ""It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up.

Most people might say that scince you are overseas, it could be dangerous. Yes it could, Luke cracked his ribs while trying to avoid falling into the Atlantic. (Ironic, isn't it?) But it is a lot of fun going across the oceans with some friends.

Remember that it is fun, you get freetime to do whatever you want, that you can see amazing places like Venice, Italy, and you get to help hundreds of people. ""But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. 'I'm grateful for the opportunity,' he says. 'It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""",3
c6b7a24,"World War II is now over in Europe. However, many countries still need help to recover their food supplies, animals, and alot more. A Seagoing Cowboy's job is to help take care of and ship cows, horses, and mules to these countries. There are many reasons more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. We would be helping alot of people and get to see amazing sights.

One reason more people should join is that we would be helping people. Many of the countries were left in terrible condition and need us to help them out by bringing animals over. The people joining would also be helping the Seagoing Cowboys. The Seagoing Cowboys need help taking care of the animals and cleaning the stalls. Bales of hay also need to be pulled up from lower holds of the ship.

Another reason more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is that they could see amazing things in the countries they visit. It is an unbelievible opportunity to see Europe and China. Seagoing Cowboys also get to see amazing sights in Greece and Italy. Such as the Acropolis and taking gandola rides.

Some people say that they would not like to join because they think we will not get any freetime and we have to work the entire time. Yes, we do have to work but we still get time for fun. Especially as we return from the trips. We get to play baseball, volleyball, and table-tennis. We also get to fence, box, read, and play other games on board.

In conclusion, it would be great for more people to become Seagoing Cowboys. You would be helping us and other countries, get the opprotunity to see the amazing countries, and still get time for fun. More people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. ",3
08cdf6e,"We all hide our emotions at one point or another but, what if we had the technology that could detect whatever were feeling despite if were trying to hold them in or not. The Facial Action Coding System or FACS is just that piece of technolgy that is capable of detecting any given emotion. Dr. Huang inventor of this software has even modified it to were it can find out any emotion or emotions all at once. It's been questioned should this kind of technolgy be used in classrooms for students. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to students in the classroom because, if any student is having troubles on the actvity at hand the Facial Action Coding System could detect that modify the prompt and make it easier for the student to then understand. Second, this software could help you better understand someone and their well-being being able to see exactly what's making them happy and what's making them upset. Third, it's better way for human and computers to ""communicate or interact"".

Anybody couldn't say that they haven't had problems understanding something at any given point in time. Simpily because, everyone can't understand everything right away with no problem/obstacle getting in the way weither it being how the words are phrased or if the vocabulary is too hard to comprehend. FACS could solve this issue right away. As presented in the passage ""Dr. Huang predicts, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" therefore making it easier for the student or user to understand what is being asked or written. Solving probems much quicker than the instrustor could explaining the information piece by piece.

Understanding emotions when communicating with someone is key. Yet, we might not recognize all that are being distrubed to us. Another great reason for FACS to come into play. As stated in the passage ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This is all very true we can't comprehend every emotion that's more dull or hidden. So why don't we get a little help at recognizing more emotions. With FACS we can better understand someones true feelings inside and their well-being. This can than lead to possibly help solving some of the persons unsolved issues and other ""troubling thoughts."" Helping them become of the better verison of themselves.

In our generation today technolgy is something that we live and breath. It's important that we become familair with technolgy and being able to use it properly and effectifly. ""Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate."" Now isn't this perfect? Huang can help us better understand computers and help computers better understand us. If students will be using computers 24/7 why not have the proper setup for them. If the software gets used in the way it's meant to it can overall have a positive effect towards the situation. After some time the computer can develop how the student or user works and operates and what they can understand and can not. Having a large postitive impact. Greater increasing the student's grades, confidence, and potentional in class. Allowing them to fully understand the content be covered better than they would ever before.

In conculsion, the Facial Action Coding System or FACS is valuable in the students classroom because, it can modify the content of the information to be better understood. Being able to see and recognize more emotions for peers. Lastly it can help the user better ""communicate"" with the computer. ",5

Driverless Cars Would Be Positive Aspects Due To The Fact That They Use Half The Feul Of Today's Taxis , They Offer Far More Flexibility Than A Bus Would , And Many Other Aspects . Driverless Cars Would Have Negative Aspects Do To The Fact That The Driverless Cars Can Not Navigate Work Zones Or Go Around Accidents Without A Driver .

My First Reason , That They Use Half The Feul Of Today's Taxis , Is Because Who Wants To Keep Causing Global Warming By The Gases That Come Out Of Your Car ? In Order To Even Have Driverless Cars We Have To Have An Earth To Keep Them On . Global Warming Is Basically Over Heating Our Earth And Is Caused By Many Things Including The Gases That Come From Cars . Using Half The Fuel Of Today's Cars For A Far More Better Transportation Sounds Pretty Good To Me .

My Second Reason , They Offer Far More Flexiblity Than A Bus , Is Because Buses Have Certain Routes And They Hold More Than One Person . I Assume That The Driverless Car Would Be A Mix Of A Bus And A Taxi Not Physically Though . Meaning It Would Pick You Up Wherever You Are Like A Bus And Taxi But It Would Drop You Off At An Exact Location Like A Taxi . Only Its A Far More Upadated Version Meaning Its Takes Half The gass We Use Not & Can Do & Go More Places Then Buses .

But Driverless Cars Have Some Negative Aspects As Well . One reason That They Are Negative Is Because They Cant Navigate Work Zones Without A Driver. So If Your Riding In A Driverless Car It Doesnt Know Where Work Sites Would Be Causing Traffic Jams And Maybe Even Crashes . Everyone Wants To Know Whether Their Drive Home Will Be Safe Or Not . Because There Is No Way For You To Inform A Driverless Car That Work Zones Are Ahead If They Dont Have A Driver .

Last But Not Least A Driverless Car Is Not Able To Go Around Accidents Without A Driver . This Means That The Driverless Car Would Either Do Three Things If Confronted By A Accident . It Would Either Cause A Big Traffic Jam , Cause Another Accident , Or Even Cause Angry Citizens . Everyone Knows An Angry Citize Is Not A Nice Citizen. Then If There Is Already A Traffic Jam Due To The First Accident And A Driverless Care Cant Get Around It , That Would Cause A Huge Traffic Jam .

All In All Those Were My Reasons Why Driverless Cars Are Both Positive And Negative Aspectd . The Positive Aspects Would Be That It Uses Half The Feul Of Today's Taxis And It Offers far More Flexibility Than A Bus . The Negative Aspects Would Be That They Cant Go Around Work Zones Or Accidents Without A Driver .        ",3
08e4b2e,"I believe the Face on Mars is actually a natural landform. Even though the face does resemble something created by aliens, I still think that it is natural. I will show you why I believe that this is just a landform, and not a face created by aliens.

I believe the Face is a natural landform because scientists believe that the face resembles landforms around the American West. One scientist said that it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Also, the scientist added that its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face.

Scientists can be wrong sometimes though. However, scientists work on their research really hard, so I believe that they know what are doing and seeing. For example, scientists say that you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so we can see what the face is, a natural butte or mesa.

In the article, it states that on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped a photo ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The image revealed that the face was just a landform, and no alien monument at all. The monument does look like aliens made it, but this fact just shows that the Face is fake and is actually is indeed a mesa.

This tells you why I believe that the Face is fake and is actually a basic landform. Even though the Face does look like aliens made it, it is more likely that it is a natural land form. These facts prove that the Face is not alien made.",3

Some people may think this new technology may be an awesome technology but some other people may also think that is just as same as other technology. For example, ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This means that this technology mostly works only when your smile like it said on the text. Yeah it may be awesome to other people but like i said it should be banned because there is no point on having that techology if that person tells you how they are felling.

7ede8e2,well i think Driverless cars would be reckless and could be dangerous rather than helpful as it says in paragraph 2 it still alerts the driver to take contol of the car when backing up or pulling into places like garages and other things. Also As it Says In Paragraph 3 It reads binary code well in my opinion what if the car cant read the binary code one day what if it just malfunctions and in paragraph 4 it says it needs alot of sensors and a couple of video cameras. after reading this article i still think the who driverless car thing is a reckless invention and not a very good investment with our tax payers money so i really think driverless cars should not be invented and googe shouldnt waste their time on it.In Paragraph 6 it says something about antilock brakes well what if that just dont work and someone gets in a brutal car crash over that malfunctioning.,2
85f1655,"""Driverless cars are coming"" is an article that informs the reader about cars that can drive themselves; but they also yield warnings about these autonomous cars.

The thought of driverless cars is fascinating! Since 2009, Google has had cars that could drive by themselves under specific situations. This gives the driver a whole new expirence from what has been expected for years. Yes, drivers still have to stay alert and navigate through various traffic issues, such as driveways, constuction work, accidents, etc., but driving just got a whole lot easier.

Automobiles are already on their way! In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistance"".

With this function, drivers don't have to worry about the stop and go, but they can worry more about their destination. GM has also added to the technology. They developed seats that would vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing in an object. Now drivers wont have to worry about that blind spot that alwys urks them, because GM has their back.

But don't think that this is all fun and games just because the car is driving for you. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver says this,"" We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way.""

Various manufacturers are hoping to bring in-car entertainment and different information systems that use heads-up displays.

So, overall driverless cars are becoming our future. I am completely for this idea. Those of us in the technology era have learned to adapt and this is just another way. People are coming up with new ways to make our lives easier and autonomous cars are just the beginning.",3
9e93646,"There are so many reason why using a car can destroy our community,personally I think using your car less would be a good idea. There are some advantages of limiting car usage,as you know the fume inside the car could give you a lot of problem with heart your lungs when you breathing air. By limiting our car usage we could have a chance of protecting the new generation from the polluted gas that comes out of the cars. In some country  many people are happy even they are not using cars to go anywhere example In Germany life goes on without the usage of cars.

Alright look I get that cars are a good transportation device because when your have a long way to go It could be very hard to there and you want to use a car that is acceptable,but like If you have to go somewhere that is 1 mile do you really need a car to get there. You don't have to have a car to have a happy life just look at this little paragraph i have search up.""As a result,70 percent of Vauban families do not own cars,and 57 percent sold a car to move here.""When i had a car I was always tense.""I'm much happier this way,"".

When we use cars a lot it cause us to buy a lot of gas that cost a lot of money. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Many teens and adults died from car accidents it might because they driving to fastor someting else. All that I am trying to say is that cars can be good for the community or it could bad for the community.

32f724d,"Driverless cars are in our near futrue. Cars like these need to have protection for everybody. I like the idea of that they are trying to make them, trying to make them smater, and trying to make smater roads for us to drive them on too. Just my opion on them is that its a good idea and I would love to experince riding one.

My thoughts on having driverless cars is that I would be a smart idea, but there is a few things like the whole smater roads thing how would we have smater roads is my question? I think that it would be expensive. Would there be only certin road we could us these types of cars on? The whole idea on have these types of cars amazes me but it would be kinda scary to try something like this out. Also I like the whole idea on that the car would have to have someone that is checking out for the car but it would be hard for the person to keep the concentration on the road.

Another thing is that the law doesnt allow us to try things out with these cars. I mean that would be a major issue for the people testing them. I also was thinking how hard would these cars be to drive? Would we have to have some special training to drive one? I read in the passage that the car would automactily tell you when it would be time for you to start driving but what if the driver is hispanic or any other race and the car tell them its there turn to drive in english. Would there be settings for that or no?

Also what is the whole point on driverless cars I think they would be able to get around in traffic, accidents , and construction sites? I think it would also be alot nicer if they could get around that stuff on there own too.

Anyway these cars would be nice to have around and all. I would also love to ride in one just to experiece the feeling and listen to the way that they would transfer to the person who is siting in the drivers seat. these cars would be the bomb if they really were driverless and are easy to control. I would love to see what it all comes down to, I really do look forward to it.",3
7c88547,"Self-Driving Cars are Amazing, But too Risky

I believe that self-driving cars would be pretty amazing technology. But when it comes down to it, how trustworthy are they? Considering the fact that you're leaving your safety to a computer. What problems could arise? A few problems for a self driving car are that it could have a malfunction, it could cost more too repair, and who do you blame on a crash if it were to happen?

Your car could easily have a malfunction. Maybe the gps could take you to the wrong location and you're in a hurry. Maybe it could not drive how it's supposed to. It could go to the other side or the road or run off the road. A self-driving car could possibly cause crashes. This goes back with leaving your safety, your children's safety, your family's safety with a computer.

A self-driving car could cost more to repair than a normal car. These cars would have to all have built-in gps systems, sensors to know what's around them, and sensors to know if there is something on the windshield. Since normal cars have drivers to manually do all this stuff, it only makes sense for all this to be very expensive. Extra parts that are not in a normal car could cost more to replace since they are not in as high demand.

Who do you blame on a crash if it happens? Nobody will know for sure. Is it the other drivers fault or is it the maufacturer of the self-driving car's fault? These are all major if questions. Also, if you are injured in a crash, who will be around to call the ambulance if you're alone and unable to get to a phone? These cars just seem too dangerous and too risky to trust.

A few problems for a self driving car are that it could have a malfunction, it could cost more too repair, and who do you blame on a crash if it were to happen? The idea seems great, but also scary.

The evidence or explanation that supports my claim is that it says so many thing that are drangeous like ""Not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than tree decades.Numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximityto us. And it also says ""A thick atmosphereofalmost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challrnging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. The sufaces temperatures average is over 800 and its pressure is 90 times bigger that what it was. This is some information of my evidence that the author supports his ides that studying venus is a worthypursuit despite the dangers.

Venus can provide only limited insighton ground conditions because most forms of light cannotpenertrate the dense atmosphere.The most important thing is that researchers cannot take saples of rocks,gas, or anything in venus.Therefore scientists want to do a mission going to understand venus .Researchers are working on innovations so the machines can last more time to knowledge.There making electronics made of silicon carbide,and they have been tested.

Then the author names our planetary neighbors, (Earth,Venus, and Mars) and how they orbit the sun diferently. The differences mean the we could closer to Mars one day and closer to Venus the next day. There are many dangers on Venus including that their thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide covers the planet of Venus.

Even though Venus is not the closest planet to the Sun it is extremely hot and it even has the hottest temperatures on a planet then any other planet in our solar system. On Venus it could have erupting volcanos,powerful earthquakes, frequent lightning strikes. We have tried to land a non human space shuttle on Venus but it tends to be damage or destoryed before even landing on the planet thats why Venus is really dangerous. ",1
9ecd631,"Intro-

This new facial software could be the next step to communicate with people without the use of words. Created by Prof. Thomas Huang and collaberated with Prof. Nicu Sebe, they have inventited a computer software that can reconongnise what a human's emotion's are (Par. 1). The new software would scan the 44 major muscles of the person, it can detect wether the person is lieing about what they are feeling or not (Par. 3). This facial software would change the way we see people, as it shows what people really are feeling.

Body-

The software created by Prof. Huang and Sebe is reliable on computers. It would scan the face and construct a 3D model of the students face with all 44 major facial mucles and would have to have a phychologist, such as Dr. Paul Eckman to judge the appereance of the face to see if it shows the 6 emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust and surprise (Par.3). This could help tell the emotions of students or if they are telling the truth on how they feel. Any student is bound to be emotional, the scanning system would be able to tell which emotion is being told because certain muscles would be activated in the face (Par. 8). These uses seem very standard but are they useful?

With only being able to scan faces, there really is not much use to this. People can already judge other people's facial expressions by noticing key differences to how someone smiles, if they are faking it or not (Par. 7). There are already lie detector tests that can prove if someone is telling the truth or not, which seems like the most cheap option. Though it doess have many uses, it can properly tell someones facial features with emotions. Better than most people can judge, a computer will be able to show what a specific person is feeling. Since humans are universal, most scanning will be accurate at telling people's emotions (Par. 4). Of course the purpose of this facial scaning can be anything us humans can already do for eachother, but the software has full knowlege of what we are feeling.

Conclusion-

The software can change our view on how we see eachother. All uses for this softtware are amazing but with even our own selves mostly capable of judging others and being accurate, it makes this software useless. We humans can already tell what we are feeling, we know ourselves better than any computer. Even phycologists have to properly tell what the emotions are and they are human not software (Par.3). This could be benifical but there are already lie detector tests that can be more accurate as it even measures pulse, which can differ with emotion. There are more downsides than upsides, but who is to say that this software wont improve in the future?",4
616eaa4,"In this essay, I'm going to talk about the new softare, that is called the Facial Action Coding system, which can help the computer to knows if we are sad, happy or angry. Putting the example of the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's called Mona lisa. I'll explain why this software is a very good idea, for the teachers and the students too. The software can calculate ""emotions"" like math homework. Just recognizing the subtle facial movemets that persons use to express how they feel.

The new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has promising application for a variety of industries. It's a new software that can recognize emotion, and it's the last innovation from prof. Thomas Huang and his colleague Are experts that are trying to do better ways for human an computers to communicate. This process begins when the computer does a 3-D model of the face; creating at least of 44 major muscles making it move like human muscles. Eckman has classifies six emotions ( happines, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddnes) Associating each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example: your muscles above your eyes rais your eyebrowns when you are surprised. The software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face.

A big example is The subject of Leonardo da Vinci's, Mona lisa. Da vinci studied anatomy to thelp them paint facial muscles for paint special emotions. This subject is really intented to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how this can computer can do. Your PC can't handle the use to decode Mona lisa smile. But this invent can write down simple instructions that ""encode"" differet emotions. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.

This software makes the computer could recognize when a student is bored or confused, then it could modify the lessons, like an human, It's great right?. It can indicate the difference between a genuinie smile and a forced one. To finish with some cientifics conclusions and understand better your boddy. According to the Facial

Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not ont only express emotions, but also may help produce them. A example is when a drama coach tells to his actor carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage because empath might happen when you see someone else expressions.

In conclusion a think this is a good idea, because you can problably know when a friend is feeling just looking on his face, so imagic that a software in your computer can know that, is amazing right?. Also this project helps a lot to the students when a subject is hard and they get confused, this is going to help you, or when you are reading too much, then you get bored. This software project would act as an human.",3
9f9702b,"The ""Face"" on Mars is indeed just a narural landform. It was first recorded in 1976. When this happened everyone went crazy because they thought it was a form of aliens. Yet they were incorect. NASA has now said that it is just a natural landform and has evedince to prove it as well.

In paragraph 3 it talks about how the fce is just a natural landfor. Saying it is just a rock formation. Also it says that the shadows just give it the illoution of being a face. Which means the sun has cast shadows on the rocks and the way the rocks were formed it made the shadows fall in the wholes appering to be a face when it really isn't.

In paragraph 7 it says that there is no alien mounuments. Proving most theroy's wrong. They found this out by taking another photo with a better liense so they can soom in and see what is really there. By doing this they found no alie monuments and that it is just a land formation as NASA origonaly belived.

Also in paragraph 12 it says the face is equivilant to mesa or buttle. Which means that it is compare to mesa and buttle wich are both natural landforms on Earth. Also in this paragraph it was proven that the rocks were created by lava. So now it is considered a lava dome.

So over all scients now belive that it is just a natural landform and that there is no aliens ther and that there never was. Insted they say it is just a rock formation that was made out of lava. So it is now cocidered a lava dome. Also they say it is just like our natural landforms here on Earth.",3
ccd90bb,"Driverless cars can be seen as an advantage or a shipwreck waiting to happen. Yes, humans have dreamed of this technology for generations, but is it truly what we need? Honestly, driverless cars could potentially cause more harm than good. They even sound scary: if a person, not in their right mind, can't drive a car functioanlly, then why can a computer? A super being that can't even think for themself? I am against the developement of these cars because they're too expensive to manufacture at a good rate, they require a driver at some point in time, and they're illegal in various areas of the United States.

As explained in the article, two seperate companies already came up with patents for driverless vehicles. They used electrical cables/ magnents within the road to create a path that the automobile could follow. As said in paragraph three, these ideas worked surprisingly well, yet they were too expensive to be practical. This idea was invented decades ago; everything was cheaper back then. Now a days, this idea also seems inpractical. the cost for these ""smart cars"" will remain insanely costly. the manufacturors will be out money because the people won't be able to afford these high priced gadgets.

I, for one, love car rides when I can't sleep at night. They help me drift off into sleep so easily and in a such a fast manor. Hundreds of people across the globe fall asleep at the wheel of an aoutmobile every week. Even with all the distractions of driving, they can't resist falling alseep. So imagine, having no distractions at all, how easy it would be to doze into that comfortable state of mind. In the article it states that drivers are occasionally needed when the car is faced with a difficult task. If driver drifted off to sleep, a wreck is bound to happen. I also feel as though too many people will put too much faith into their vehicle that they'll become unaware and uncareful about what's going on in particular scenarios that they are needed in, and they'll find themselves in a fateal accident.

What good if a car in a round country trip if it's illegal to drive in certain states? What are people supposed to do if they cross the boarder into a state that disapproves of these new and ""improved"" vehicles? Just turn around and take another route? It's pointless to have a vehicle you can't take everywhere with you. Laws aren't just made for no reason; they're there to keep the community safe. If it's supposedly dangerous to ride in an un-manned vehicle, then why do it? In paragraph nine, it states that presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. I believe in this law wholey and completely.

In my opinion, driverless cars are unsafe. There are many statistics and facts stating that safety is a huge risk with these vehicles and it's very true. A computer cannot possibly predict how a human mind will act or what a person will do unconciously; these vehicles won't be able to have last minute reactions.

I am against the developement of these cars because they're too expensive to manufacture at a good rate, they do require a driver at some point in time, and they're illegal in various areas of the United States. Driverless cars are thought to be the future; I want no part in such a dangerous place. ",5
ba0f363,"Mr. Senator election by popular vote is the way to go, let the people decide!  It's their choice to pick who runs the U.S.A. this is the choice of who they want to run the country.  The citizens should have a right to vote for who they really want.  Instead of having a couple hundred people I think we should have all the people in the country choose.  So why dont we?  We can establish this rule and make it right let the citizens of the U.S.A. pick who the president should be!

Electoral collage  as the office of Federal Register in quote ""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting og the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President"".  It's a bad idea to me when you can just make everyone vote for who they want not who just a couple hundred people want.  The Electoral College consists of 538 electors which a certain amount need to vote as 270 is the precise number is required.  Each candidate running each has a group of electors, they are originally chosen by the candidates politicial party.  The choice where the people choose and vote is way easier than that, we have a choice for what we want.

The ""Indefensible Electoral College"" is wrong your voting for the electors as it says in paragraph 10.  Bradford Plumer says as I quote ""Under the electoral college sysetem voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President.  There for we are voting for the electors right?  So whats the whole point when we can stick to our ways and vot ourselves.  This makes it way more simple and faster, better than waiting through the system for other people to vote, when you can just do it yourself.

Theres no reason for each party to select a slate of electors.  It can be argued that this system can turn off potential voters as a candidate.  There are 5 reasons for retaining this system.  Those are certainty of outcome, everyone's President, swing States, Big states, and avoid run-off elections.  Still we need to be able to make our own decisions.  We don't need other people to make them for us.

These people in the U.S.A. are determined in what they want, not what other people want.  They want to choose what they believe they don't want to go through a long system. When you can just do it yourself its easier, because you know what your doing but if you go the other way you have to teach the people your working with.  When you have the whole Country voting it makes it more simple and easy to go through the process.  So let the people choose who they really want as the President of the U.S.A. dont leave it to other people to do it for them.

7ab6a22,"Is it or isn't it? I think that it isnt. There are too many reasons why it is just a landform and not a human. For example it says ""A few days late NASA unveiled the image for all of us to see. The caption noted ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head"" this is why I think it is a landform.

Another reason I think it is a landform is because as we got closer to the ground of Mars is got clearer and clearer. It came out to be a mesa. In the 70's they didn't have to best cameras so it looked a little blury and came out to be a face.

As cameras got better and better it became clearer and clearer. If they were to do it today they would really see what it was. The text says ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

This means that it was proven that it was a land form. If it was a human or a living creature we would be able to tell. Some people think it was a conspirasy. I think it was because if it wasn't we would still be looking at it.

So people can think what they want but I think it was a landform. Is there life or Mars? If there is will we ever know?          ",3

Also people could get some exersice at that by walking to work or school or wherever you are going to and the percentage of people with obesity would most likey drop down excessivley by just doing this.

You also might actually have a happier life by giving up automoblies for example what this person Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This evoultion of limiting car usage is very beneficial especially for the environment by decreasing carbon and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and all of the bad gasses going into the air by all these automobiles and just maybe get or climate and everything back together they way it should be.

In this new approach, to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation. Stores are placed just a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highways where you need a car to get there.

By doing things like this especially in America would be big in safety because you would have to worry as much about your children being hit or ran over by cars or being kidnapped to because you can only walk or ride bikes, taxis and public buses.

Therefore you can also take time and actually look where you are and where you live and take it all in instead of panicing and being all tense and stressed on having to rush or go somewhere and just being in a calm, peaceful and quiet location. Like in what thisperson Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman said "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" as he rode on a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

By doing this it would also decrease the amount of congestion in different cities across the globe.

In my opinion, I'd love to try in do this because we would  not be on our phones going strait to our cars  instead we would be walking or riding our bike or get on a public bus and actually see and meet people instead of just waiting in the traffic and waiting to just go and do whatever we want to and the Internet is a big deal in this to. A sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center cities various factors like: the Internet makes telecommutung possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to goo and meet up with friends.

0fbd5ba,"Many look up into the sky and see Venus, one of the brightest points in the night sky. While it looks like a star, it is actually a planet. In fact, it is a planet that is extremely difficult to examine closely. According to the author, it is transparent that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers due to the fact that Venus used to be very similar to Earth, the conditions are survivable, and that there are many approaches that can be taken to explore it. The author supports the idea that exploring Venus has immense value well.

Foremost, Venus used to be very similar to Earth. Scientists can research Venus and discover its differences and similarities to Earth. Paragraph four of the article states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may as well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This demonstrates that astronomers are curious about Venus's transformation from a once Earth-like planet to an inhospitable planet. Paragraph four also states, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" This is crucial because space travel can often take long periods of time. The travel time to Venus will not take nearly as long as other space endeavors.

In addition, Venus's conditions can be survivable to humans. If the expeditions are controlled and cautious, endeavors to Venus are definitely possible. In the article, paragraph five says,""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would alllow scientists to float above the fray."" NASA's plan for trips to Venus would be similar to having a spacecraft hovering over Venus's atmosphere. Paragraph five also proclaims, ""air pressure would be close to that of sea level at Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This means that the journey and process will not be extremely hazardous. The conditions at thirty miles above Venus's atmosphere would be simlar to the condtions on Earth. The dangers are not present at this altitiude and astronomers are still able to collect useful data.

Moreover, there are many other innovative approaches to studying Venus. Paragraph seven states, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions."" This displays how researchers can explore Venus's surface without risking human lives. This method is safe and nonhazardous toward humans and is necessary to advance the research of Venus. Paragraph six declares, ""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough missionto understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" Scientists are building machines to decrease levels of risk and contribute insightful knowledge to the cause, which makes exploration seem all the more desirable.

Overall, expeditions to Venus are valuable. Gaining statistics about Venus will not only be helpful for scientists analyzing Earth but also with future space missions. Venus is close and similar to Earth. Exploration is survivable and can be safe with the right technology. The author presents these ideas thoroughly and accurately to inform that space travel to Venus is a worthy pursuit. Venus, one of the brightest ""stars"" in the sky, will lead travels from Earth beyond doubts and towards innovation.",5
6d8da85,"The author of the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In paragraph 1 the author states, ""While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."" This sentence shows the author's beleif that Venus is a quite challenging planet to explore when up close. So far the author has given his opening formed one of his main ideas.

In paragraph 2 the author gives background information on how Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size, yet every previous spaceship sent to Venus did not survive the landing. The author is doing a very good job at the beginning of the article to establish his main idea and giving relevant background information to support his idea. In paragraph 3 the author continues to label the reasons in which Venus is a dangerous planet to land on by giving the information that its' Is composed of nearly 97% carbon dioxide and its' ground temperatures average 800 degrees fahrenheit. So far the author is doing a very thorough job of describing the dangers of Venus, yet has not made an agrument that explains why it is a worthy persuit despite its' dangers.

In paragraph 5 the author starts to uncover some of NASA's ideas on how further exploration of Venus would be possible. One of those ideas include a hot air ballon style of exploration craft that will allow scientists to hover around 30 miles off of the planet's surface. The author goes on to say that this solution will certainly not make the conditions of Venus easy to handle, yet they will make them survivable. In the same paragraph the author also explains the importance of exploration on Venus. He goes on to say that Venus is on eof the closest planets in our solar system to Earth. This means that Venus may have at one point sustained life just like the planet Earth. This, in turn, gives an appealing reason in which exploration of Venus should definetly be considered.

In paragraphs 6 and 7 the author somewhat refutes his prior information from paragraph 5. The author does this by saying that although the blimp will keep scientists in survivable condition it will not aid them in collection surface samples or allow them to take pictures of the ground due to the overlaying carbon dioxide blocking the view of the planet. The author then goes on to explain that scientists have found a new solution to this problem. They decided that modren robots are too ""weak"" to explore the planet of Venus due to the amount of technology inside of them. If one wire comes undone then the whole robot is unusable. In order to combat this, the author states that scientists are planning on using mechanical computers due to their low use of actual technology. The author very effectivly refutes the opposing claim (the idea of the blimp) and then gives an example that shows how that original idea can be improved.

Overall, the author correctly supports his ideas and claims with background information and properly demonstrates how Venus is a worthy pursuit of exploration despite the dangers it presents.",5

bda3710,"Stop arguing with me Bob, I know I'm right about the face on mars. How could you think the face was created by aliens, thats just crazy. You have no evidence to prove your point about how you think aliens created the face. I on the other hand have plenty of evidence to support my claim.

When the ""Face on Mars"" was first discovered the Viking 1 had found it by mistake. The Viking 1 was looking for a place for its sister ship to land, and stumbled on it by mistake. The picture the Viking 1 took resembled a human face but, it was very shadowy and not the clearist picture. When NASA reveled the ""Face on Mars"" it became the instant topic everywhere. Everywhere you went peope talked about the face.

NASA wasn't done with the face on Mars. On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Web sufers everywhere were whating for the first image to appear. When the imaage first appeared on a JPL web site it revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after. But of course not everyone was satisfied. Sadly it was winter it on the Red Planet. Thanks to all the wispy clouds, the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Sadly clouds had covered parts of the Face. Some people still thought the Face was hiding alien markings.

On April 8, 2001a cloudless summer day in CydoniaMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. What was it going to find on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia? What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It didnt't show any airplanes or Egyptian-style pyamids.

See Bob I have so much more avidence than you. Your alein markings were proven not true. All The Face actully showed was a butte or mesa. There were no alien Egyptian style markings. The face is just a simple land form on the face of the Red Planet.",3
93b2441,"Schools Should use Facial Action Coding Systems

Try to imagine a world where people might be able to hide their feelings from others but not the computer. There has been a new software developed that has the ability to determine people's emotions called Facial Action Coding System. The software has even been able to determine exactly how much percent of each emotion is present in the Mona Lisa. As this software arises, there has been questions as to how schools could use this software to their advantage. With this system, schools could help students stay in tune in class, place students with teachers they learn well from, and force students to tell the truth.

The Facial Action Coding Sytem should be used in schools because teachers would have the opportunity to change the way they are teaching when their students start to get bored. In so many cases students do not do well in school simply because their teacher might be too boring or confusing. If teachers had the abilty to know when students are getting bored through this system, then there is a good chance the students would get better grades as a result. With this software ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" There would be no excuses for teachers boring or confusing students because they would have a tool to become aware of it.

Another key part of students being successful in school is having a teacher that they truly connect with, therefore; the software system could play a large part in helping schools place students with teachers that they have a connection with. With the software system, ""a genuine smile and a forced one"" could be detected. Using the data found students could be placed with the teachers that they have genuine smiles with. There is a good chance that if students were with a teacher they truly like, then they would learn more from the lessons and get better grades.

In schools, there are constantly so many lies and rumors going around, but with the software system, lying could be detected. Considering the system can ""spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful,"" it could be able to determine when students are lying. If lying in schools could be detected, there could be a decrease in bullying and possibly shootings. It could even teach students that honesty is the best policy, and it could hold students accounable for their actions. The system could uncover the truth in so many situations for the better.

In the end, the new software system has many positive aspects that could benefit schools in many ways, including helping students learn more effeciently and forcing students to tell the truth. Not using this tool that has come available would be foolish knowing the many benefits that could come from it. Something that could help students learn their school work in a more efficient way and hold students responsible for their actions would be a good thing for schools in this day and age. It could have the capabiliy to teach students integrity at a young age putting them ahead of many young adults in the world today.",4
8c25a44,"I think that the idea of driverless cars is an awful idea because, ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" This ruins the whole point of taking away human error and letting something else drive you. Plus I think that the transition between the car driving and the driver driving would cause more crashes. I could also foresee unprepared drivers to try to use these new ""driverless"" cars. Overall, driverless cars seem to be a waste of time and money to me because they would bore the driver and cause more accidents.

First of all, I think that driverless cars are a waste of time and money because you still need a driver to pay attenton. For me, this would just ruin the whole experience of not having to drive. Even Dr. Werner Huber from BMW agreed that drivers would get bored when he admitted that, ""The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge."" This was in response to the question, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive."" Secondly, I think that not having to focus on the road will lead the driver to lose focus so that when they are called upon to drive, they are not ready. The transition from the car drving to the human driving would likely lead to more wrecks because when you are not focusing on driving, you don't really care about focusing on the road. Driverless cars seem to present the same distraction that texting has, and texting while driving is illegal in most states. I also know that some people do not drive because they are not very good at it, and the idea of a ""driverless car"" might tempt them to drive one. These same unprepared drivers would still have to, ""take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues,"" if they were driving a google car which would lead to yet again, more accidents.

Driverless cars are a big hoax. They are not even truly driverless because, "" they still alert the driver to take over."" This would just be boring waiting for your turn to drive. These would also cause more accidents with the rough transition of taking over the wheel especially when unprepared drivers try to use this new technology. I don't think that anyone wants worse drivers on the road, more accidents, more expensive cars, and an even more boring experience with the new and not so impressive driverless cars.",4

This explains why the author is explaining why the pursuit is dangerous, A long time ago the autor stes that Venus probaly had a ocean like earth and many other forms of life as well, and Just because it can be really dangerous to try to even visit Venus that does not mean we will not try.

The author suggests that studdying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite dangers it presents and it could be immpossible. The author states that ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"" (para.3). This explains the accertion because it would kill us as soon as we enterted in the atmosphere. So that would mean that it would be very dangerous to pursuit Venus.

A long time ago Venus was just like Earth. The autor states that ""Long ago, Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" (Para 4). This explains that Earth wasjust like Earth a long time ago because it was covered largely with oceans. Another reason it was just like Earth was it could have supported many other forms of life as well.

Just because it's really dangerous to pursuit Venus that doesn't mean we are going to stop trying to send people to Venus.

They said they would go 30 miles above the surface so they would not harm the people.

The musculer movement work is like pretending and force to be smile but not movement of facial muscles only expresses emotions, but can help you to produce them.

Finally, in the article the author decribed six basic emotions. The basic emotions are ""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" each of them related to movements of the facial muscles.

8b49919,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author believes that Venus is worthy of human research and time although the task poses multiple dangers. I stand by the authors claim because we would gain information on how our universe works, and how it was many millions of years ago. The article states that although Venus is sometimes ""around the corner"", humans have sent many unmanned spacecrafts to attempt to explore and learn about Venus as a planet. Those spacecraft have not survived landing for more than a couple of hours. This has discouraged humans enough that we have yet to send another spacecraft to Venus in over three decades.

The challenges are very rough and will not be anywhere close to a easy task. First they have to get through a thick atmosphere almost consisting of 97% carbon dioxide. After the atmosphere, you will have to survive the clouds which consist of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Then you would need to figure out how to help deal with its average surface temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest surface temperature of any planet in out solar system.

Next, you'll have to create something sturdy enough to withstand its atmospheric pressure which amost 90 times geater than Earth's. The geolocial features and weather such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes will also aid in ruining the journey.

If we can overcome these obsticles we could learn much more about Venus's past, present, and future. The more knowledge we have will help to futher even more research and hopefully explore even more in our universe.",3
0eb8d11,"Technology in modern day is advancing in leaps and bounds, and one of the areas people are most interested in is transportation. People are constantly looking to make their commute faster, easier, and more fun. Safety is a main concern for many, and society is looking to create fatality-free roads. As such, driverless cars are the ultimate goal for our society. There are many pros and cons to such a thing, and the risks far outnumber the gain at least for the time being.

Many poeple argue that automated cars would be safer than a human driver. People are subject to risks such as distraction, drunk driving, and human error while machines are immune to such ailments. An automated car can safely navigate under certain conditions, and when a threat is apparent that the car cannot handle on its own, a human can take over. For several years, cars have been built with systems such as automatic brakes and other automated features that can assist the driver or fully take over the car. Traction control brakes sense when a car is sliding and stop it even if the person behind the wheel doesn't realize that they are in danger. With successful technology like this, people assume that making cars fully automatic would increase the safety. People would even get the chance to relax while in the car. Trips that formerly took a week or more could be made in days if the car could drive itself while the human driver slept. It would also be possible for people to do things such as work or watch television while in the car, things that previously would cause incredible danger.

While there are many benefits to fully automated cars, there are also risks that come with the technology. First of all, the technology does not even exist yet, and it is unclear when it will. For now, cars are only partially automated and fully automated cars would need a certain set of requirements to be met in order to function properly and safely. The amount of sensors needed to achieve full automation is astounding. It would take several different kinds of sensors including cameras, radar, and many more. Some of these need magnets or radio signals while on the road to function, so if an anomaly occured that put them out of commission, things could go terribly wrong. The cost of such things is incredibly high. The car in and of itself would cost much more than the same model without automation. Tax payers would be required to pay for installing magnets or other feedback technology on roads so the cars would have enough information to function properly, and people could fall into debt for the luxury of an automated car.

In the year 2016, automated cars are a dream that is far too dangerous and costly to pursue. Years in the future, it may be an innovation bringing safety and comfort to hudreds of people, but in the present it is impossible. The cost of installing the necessary technology for such cars to function would delve too far into taxpayers' pocketbooks to be truly profitable, and the technology would need replaced every few years anyway. If something were to malfunction in just one car, it could cause mass chaos and death or injury to potentially hundreds of people. At this point in time, the technology has too much risk to be possible in the near future.",4

You and a couple of your workers were talking and assumed that it was just a regular landform and changed as the years went by. The manager had did a little debate, if they thought it was made by an alien they would have to go on one side and if they thought it was just a natural landform that is going to change as the years go by they would have to go on the other side. The people of NASA that thought it was an alien artifact, had to explain and decribe why. One of them volunteered and said that they think it is made by an alien because there is no way that it is just going to change through the years. You interupt him and say that is possible because many things change over the years, policies, laws, taxes, and many more things. You explain to them that it is not made by an alien becuase the photographer of viking 1 and viking 2 goes around and takes pictures of the planet as it circles around then they noticed something different about the figure when the picture was shown. The people that is on your side agree with you and say that you are true so they ask for more evidence to make your statement better than what it was. So you tell them that what the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. You and the co-workes take the last look of the picture and you are amazed. As the years goes by you see that the face doesnt appear on anymore of the picutures from the time it started to the time it ends ( 1998 - 2001. ) ",3
a63e5a3,"Can you imagine you not having to drive your own car? Well in the future driverless cars are coming to you. Many car brands are in on driverless cars. However, I am against driverless cars because of their many side affects. You may still want a driverless car because of the advantages but I do not want a driverless care due to it's many disadvantages.

Driverless cars are coming in the future. Most people are excited about driverless cares because they blocked out the disadvantages. Other people feel how I feel, that driverless cars are dangerous and cause many problems to whomever may get in behind a driverless car. Driverless cars have advantages to a certain exctint but I feel they are unsafe to all humans no matter how they work.

Driverless cars are expensive to make and would cause you to have to upgrade roads just so they can work which would cost millions and billions of unneeded dollars. Driverless cars are not so driverless, they still want you to take over the will as much as they neeed you to. Whenever their is an accident or something that the driverless car can't handle the human in the car has to take over and drive. This is very unsafe because humans may become unalert and unaware due to the fact that they are no longer in control of moving the vehicle they are in.

Driverless cars are unsafe because if a human were to fall alseep they are unaware to their surroundings. Humans are unaware of the fact they have to still drive in oder to be safe and not cause damage to anything around them. A human has to pull in and out of the drive way in the driverless car. If the driverless car is so great, how come humans still have to drive? That is one reason why we should stick to humans driving their own cars.

A driverless car the car will drive at a constant speed of 25 miles. In some cases that may be to slow. If their was an emergency the car would drive way to slow and could possibly put a humans life in danger due to the slow speed. In a driverless car, the point is to not have a human driving the car at all. In the driverless cars they still want humans to drive, humans tend to get bored and lack intrest waiting for a situation to happen.

Safety is such a big concern in driverless cares. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car as a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing liminted use of semi-autonomous cars; manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--- the driver or the manufacturer?

On behalf on all humans I feel we need to stick to human driven cars. In driverless cars we would have to always worry about our safety. We would have to worry about the "" what ifs"" and all the possibilaties that could happen being in the driverless car. Many humans could be injuried or seriously hurt due to being in a driverless car. If anything were to happen in the driverless car who will the blame be put on, the person who made it or the person in

it?

In conclusion, drivers should go the safer route and drive themselves around instead of relying on a monitored car. You still have to worry about the possibilaty of something happening to you or anyone else in the car especially if you have any children. Drivers are much safer driving themselves around not having to worry about something happening to them or them putting their life in danger by entering the driverless car. Driverless cars may be cool but very unsafe until proven than can be safe and well organized all humans should stick to taking their self everywhere like we have over the last hundreds of decades.",5
85fc106,"Have you ever heard of a driverless car? Google has had driverless cars like this since 2009. These cars have driven more than half a million miles without a single crash. These types of carsstill have to have a human operate them when pulling into drivways, going around accdents, or having to deal with complicated traffic issues.

My position on driverless cars are, they should not be a thing. There would be more car wrecks than there are now. What if the car ends up turning at the wrong area and does not pick up that there is a car in front of them. The car would end up crashing and could the result could be life threatening. The car could have a bad sensor and just keep driving straight. Then, the car would end up hitting a pedestrian or another object.

There are positive sides to the driverless cars though. The cars will save individuals more on gas money. The driverless cars use only half of the fuel of today's taxis. They say that the driverless cars are also more flexible than a bus. You also would not have to have your hands on the steering wheel at all times. You can relax and just watch your surroundings. The car will alert you when you need to take control over the car again. You also would not have to buy a car because you could the driverless cars would be a public transportation like taxis.

There are more negative things about the cars then there are positive. What if the car just shuts down in the middle of the highway? More people are going to hit you and it will affect more people. What if the sensors are very sensitive and will detect a branch in the middle of the road? The car will stop and people will hit your bumper. There are a lot of dangerous and life threatening things about the driverless cars.

The driverless cars seem very neat but, they also seem very dangerous. Too many things could go wrong, like a sensor could go out and you could hit another vehichle. The car could miss the turn and you could hit a pedestrian or another object. If the sensors are very sensitive, they could detect the smallest thing like a small tree branch and cause your vehichle to stop in the middle of the road. These cars will cause more crashes than the regular human driving cars. They also say that the safest vehichle, is a human driving vehichle. In my opinion the driverless cars are a very bad idea to bring into this world.",4
17a36e4,"In the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both postivie and negative aspects of driveless cars. The author uses many good arguments whether drivless cars should be or should not be a way of transportation. Sergey Brin, a Google cofounder, envisions a future with a public transportation system where trips of driveless cars form a taxi transport system. He believes these driveless cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility. Brin also believes theses such cars would change the world fundamentally.

As I mentioned before, the author uses both positive and negative views for the topic of driveless cars. I personally think the idea of a driveless car is a great idea. Television, movies, and many people have been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves for a long time. I am for the driveless cars for various reasons. According to Google, their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Due to reckless driving, texting and driving, and many other incidents that occur in the real world, not very often can you drive long distances without seeing an accident. I believe these cars being cheaper on fuel would benefit the people who own them, by being able to save money. Driveless cars also give the owner the ability to do other task instead of focusing only on the road. The idea of the driveless car also has some negative aspects about it. But, I believe overall the invention of the driveless car would benefit atleast every owner at some point.

Automakers of the driveless cars are continuing their work for the hope that some day, driveless cars will be avaible.Driveless cars will change the world for the best. Although, we have not been totally successful yet, we grow closer to the destination of driveless cars every day. I believe driveless cars would have a great impact on everybody.        ",3
750f236,"Everyday we go to school and after a while it can get boring. This new technology could help make students less bored while learning. For that reason, I think that a Facial Action Coding System in the classroom might improve the overal mood. With the FAC System in place, not only the computer would know to switch up the lesson but the teacher would also know how students are reacting to their teaching or new material. This system could help teachers adapt the material or their teaching style better to the needs of their students. This would help to encourage a positive learning environment and improve the overall classroom mood. Dr. Huang noted that most human communication is nonverbal so this would be an effective tool in the classroom because not all kids would speak how they are feeling. With more technology coming into the classroom every day, more learning is taking place online and FACS technology could make online learning more fun and enjoyable for the students. According the the Facial Feedback Theroy of Emotion, moving your facial muscles may even help produce emotions so someone saying ""put a smile on your face"" may actually make you happier. This could be possible in the classroom if FACS technology was implemented. In conclusion, I think that adding FACS technology to the classroom would be a positive action. It could help students learn better by altering the program or giving the teachers feedback of how the students are reacting to their teaching. The FACS is probably along way off from being put in the classroom but I'm sure it will become an invaluable tool for education in the future. ",3
946f2b5,"I dont think the a computer reading emotins would be valuable in a classroom because technology is not always acurrate. We use a lot of different facial muscles when just making one facial expression. Student dont really show emotion when the class their in is boring.

One reason i dont think its valuable because emotions can change at any moment .Saying someone is 80% happy in a pictuer wouldnt always be ture becuase they could be smiling but also could be more sad than they are happy. Some people have a bipolar disoder which makes their eomtion change very fast , and some people are just very temperamental. Some students show emotions differnt than others . For example one student that is very upset could be yelling and shouting about it and another student that as angery as the other student could be very calm about it and not showing that they are angery.

Another reason i dont think its acurrate is because sometimes we dont just use one muscle to make a facial expresion. The computer only test one facial muscle to an emotion. Paragraph three states"" For example , your frontails pars laterlis muscle raises your eyebrows when your surprised ..."" but also when someone is surprised they sometimes move their mouth muscles. We move our mouth muscles for almost every emotion.

I dont think it would be a good idea to put one of these computers in a classroom becuase each student shows emotion different and some students might not shoe emotion at all , therefore the computer would be getting emotion from about half the claaroom which wouldnt be acurrate .",3
cad1f5b,"In the article the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursit despite the dangers it presents. Thus for that reason the author wrote many claims in the article to support his idea. I also belive that the author is fasinated by the planet Venus because in paragrah two he tells us the readers facts about the planet venus on how it is a twin on the planet Earth. Also mentions in paragraph one that it is easy to spot Venus in the Earth ground level.

The author is so fasinated of Venus he knows there is dangers to do further investigations on the planet. For exapmle, in paragraph 3 it tells us that the atmosphere of Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide witch basically blankest the whole plant with it. Another prime example will be that the surface level in Venus is 800

degrees Fahrenheit witch is way to hot for a human to step in it. For those reasons it will be too dangerous for a hman to do research but, NASA has found a way to investigate Venus to make it sutible for a human to survive. There reason will be that they will have a shuttle

hover 30 or so miles above roiling Venus lanscape. making it decently suitable for a human to survive and do further research.

In conclusion, those will be the reasons why the author thinks it will be suitable for a human to do reseacher for venus even though it wil be to hot but yet stainable for a human to continue in the reaserch on venus. i have informed youi about the article.      ",2

7199105,"Dear State Senator,

I am here to inform you that you should change election to a popular vote for the president of the United States. This is due to the fact that as of now Americans vote to elect their president, but what good is that if they don't even recieve what they want? What is even the point of voting? Saying this, I agree with source two on its point, ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. This is backed up with data from the same article stating that voters can't even control whom their electors vote for. This is clearly why ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Without a doubt if you cared for your people, the people who support you and give you your job opportunity, you would see that you should abolish this electoral college. Even a blind man could see that.

You may be wondering if your people think this is such a bad idea, why would our founding fathers impliment something so horindess? As you see ""electoral college was established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"", says source 1. Although that sounded great at the time, today electoral college is frowned upon because majorly because of its ""winnr-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. As if that wasn't unfair enough, the electors don't even necessarily have to vote for their states choice. This would be similar to if I was infatuated with a color, I then asked my team what our team color should be and after taking a vote, I chose the color I preferred because I was bias even though my whole team disliked it. This is obviously the wrong way to run our election ecspecially the most important in our country.

On the other hand I do understand that there are some advantages to an electoral college. These include, mentioned in source 3, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaignthan a small state does. This is fair because there are more people in big states then small therefore big states should get more of a voice. Although in popular vote big states would still get the bigger vote because there are more people voting therefore they have more votes. This is why I think the middle man should just be cut out leaving us with a popular vote.

According to the facts it is clear to me that the electoral college should be siezed. I think it is unnecessary as well as unfair. When we think of voting for our president, that is what we want to do. Voting for our president does not include voting for someone who may or may not choose our choice. Also if we chose our President by popular vote all the votes that weren't majority would add up and possibly make the difference between the vote results. This is why it is unfair to simply use majority rule for each state and practically erase the other votes off the table. As you can see State Senator your people vote to elect their ruler. Why deny them of this oppurtunity. It is clear to me that the electoral college may have been a good concept to our founding father but when applyed is not the best decision. This is why I think you should change to an election by popular vote for president of the United States.    ",4
0a50c61,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does a good job to prove that Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers that are presented, they do this by giving information based on actual conditions, studies and actual experiences. The author used a combination of all three of these to prove their claim that Venus is worth the danger.

The conditions in Venus are a great mix of specific material. The author thoroughly explains each part of the atmosphere in Venus. The text says that "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify metals."" They are proving that the conditions on Venus would exceed anything that our bodies could handle.

Despite saying this, they make a point when they begin into the discussion of the education it could bring us. In the text it is shown that ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet it our solar system."" The author supports his argument very well when they say this. They used a status stand point which gives the author more credibility. He then forms a question within the text, by doing this it brought them the opportunity to show the research they had conducted for this writing piece.

The author brought in the research on the true experiments that were thought up through NASA. He builds up NASA's ideas by explaining to the deepest points, but never hits an oppostion until the next paragraph. When they do this it creates an amazing idea that could have the possibility to work imaged into the readers heads.

They eventually hit the oppostition and shows the down fall with NASA's great plan. They state in the text that "" More importatnly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and persoanl despite the risks."" When the author decides to say this they prove the irony of it all. If you can't be up close and personal with the planet then you can't learn the reasons you truly cannot be. From the opposing standpoint it was supported very well once they did that.

They then go back on track to support their claim. They do this by explaining the experiments done in the past. They state a comparison to the readers when they say, "" Just imagine exposing a cell phone tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin,"" This comment that was made impacts the writing positvely. When they do this it gives the readers something to think about or imagine. It brings the issue to them and gives them a chance to relate somehow.

The conclusion that he provides gives a clear closing. He states his claim again and uses his evidence to bring the topic to a point. The closing gives you something to think about, it leaves you wondering about the topic and forming your own opinions. In the conclusion it states, "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet te very edges of imagination and innovation."" The right thing is to not starve us from the education that could be provided just because of a dangerous boundary. All of the evidence that they have stated and proven through the whole essay just ends with them eventually just stating that it is the right thing to do.

The author does a good job of proving this through the whole essay.              ",5
142330b,"People have their own opinions about the Electoral College; whether it should be taken away or kept. They have good reasons, but honestly do they really need the electors to vote for our people?

The Electoral College should be abolished. Why do people still defend the electoral college? The voters don't even vote for a president. They vote for a slate of electors. Why can't us voters control the electors. You're not really voting for the president, you're basically voting for electors who are pledged to the specific candidate. The electoral college isnt needed.

Let the voters vote for who they want. They know what that candidate is gonna do for their people when they become president. We don't need people who are pledged to that candidate to keep debating over them. It states that when you vote for a presidential candidate, you are actually voting for a slate of electors.

The Electoral College stays with us, only to keep the voting in balance. They should just do the winner-take-all. Everyone despises the electoral college. It has no purpose to be retained, but only to keep the voting balanced.    ",2

aa5918f,"Today, there are advance technology in the society such as computers, cars, cell phones, and etc but no one ever tried to develop an driverless cars. Today in our society, many people tried to develop new technologies because things are getting more advanced an effective. Driverless cars are one of their plan, where the cars has sensors and know what to do. I agree the development of driverless cars because the cars uses less fuel, less car accidents, and there is still alert in the car.

The driverless cars should be develop and introduced to the soiety because the cars uses less fuel than the cars we used today. The text states, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" From this example we can tell that the cars is great because they used less fuel than the the cars we sued today. Thus, people do not have to worried about they will ran out the fuel when they're driving. Most of the people loved to use cars that used less fuels because they do not have to spend much money on the fuel. The text also states, ""Offer far more flexibility than a bus."" This example shows that the driverless cars have more rooms than a bus. People to sit in a place where there is not croweded because it's comfortable. Driverless cars solved the overcroweded the problem because it got more spaces. Thus, I agree the development of the cars.

While the driverless cars used less fuel, the cars can drive million miles without a crash. The text states, ""Their cars have driven more than half million miles without a crush."" This example tells us that the car is safer than the cars we drive today. If a car can drive million miles without any crashing then we considered it's an great car because most of the cars were not safe and it gets into car accident very often.

The most important is that there are still alert in the car. The text states, ""...Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of hallways."" This example shows that when there is something happened to the car, the cars will alert the driver that there is something going on but most of the cars do not have that kind of technique. Second, the text states, ""Dealing with comlicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" This example shows that when there is an major accidents or traffic issues then the car will alert you to move out the car quickly before anything happened. In other hand, people disagree to develop the driverless cars. The text states, ""Why would anyone want a driverless cars that still needs a driver?"" They claimed that the driverless cars should do everything by itself instead having the dirver controlling it. They think there is no difference if we use a normal car. I disagree with them because it's safer if we have a real driver in the car, they'll prevent anything bad happened.

Driverless cars can have more advanced technique in the future when there are more people supporting it. Thus, we should not give up on developing the cars because the cars uses less fuel, less car accidents, and there are still alert in the car that helped people to know what happened.     ",5
2d58e14,"The author supports this idea very well by doing excellent research on venus such as it's atmosphere that includes carbon dioxide blankets and clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid and also adds the temperature of the planet venus that averages over 800 degrees farenheit. It's good that author includes these details to let us know of the obstacles that we must surpass to explore venus and another major reason the author uses to support the idea of exploring venus despite the danger. Is how the terrain and landscape of venus is so simliar to our planet earth. Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and includes valleys, mountains and craters. The author also states that venus could be our nearest option for planetary visit. The author also includes solutions and options on how to overcome the dangerous obstacles of the planet venus such as NASA's possible solution which is a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the landscape of venus giving scientists the option to float above the fray. This would allow the vehicle to hover and avoid the deadly and unfriendly ground conditions that is the surface of venus but this vehicle would make it difficult to gain insight on ground or surface conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmospehere. This would make rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective and most importanly the author states that researchers can't take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance and to understand venus and it's nature. A mission would have to be up close and personal and the author states that these risks are merely challenges and states that many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus. The author supports the idea of studying venus despites it's dangers and risks very well by including solutions and options on how to explore venus safely and another approach on how to explore venus safely from NASA is the use of simplified electronics made of slicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and amazingly have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. another project the author includes is the use of mechanical computers and these devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world II. These devices require no electrictonics at all and can almost certainly survive the the harsh conditions of venus. As the author states and suggests that systems that use mechanical parts

can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. In conclusion the author supports the idea of exploring venus very well by including the problems and obstacles and by also including the devices and projects that can used to solve these problems and obstacles such as vehicle like blimps, electronics made of silicon carbide and mechanical computers. That all are made of specific materials that are made to survive the harsh conditions of venus that include carbon dioxide blankets, clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, extremely hot temperatures, eruping volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. All in all the author supports his passion and idea of exploring venus very well. Including informative information and supporting evidence to support his ideology of exploring venus.",3
2228575,"Technology has become very advanced, and it has helped with many problems in today's society. Though, technology like the Facial Action Coding System is extremely advanced, and could have a major positive affect. Not only could it have a major positive affect on today's society, but it could also have a positive affect on future generations. I believe that the Facail Action Coding System could be very valuable; if it is used for the right reasons. The Facial Action Coding System could help solve many problems in today's society. It could help the law, it could help teachers form better teaching methods, and it can be used for medical purposes.

The law has trouble with telling when someone is lying or even when they are telling the truth. I believe that the Facial Action Coding System could help solve this problem. Acorrding to the paragraph, the Facial Action Coding System can calculate the percent of the certain facial expressions that you are making. Which we all know that when most people lie, they make a certain facial expression or they act a certain way. If police and judges were able to use this sofwear they would be able to tell when someone is liying, and when someone is telling the truth. They could use the Facail Action Coding System as a lie detector. Doing this could help reduce crime rate, and it could help lock away people that deserve to be put in jail rather than innocent people.

Not only could the Facial Action Coding System help the law, but it could also help in schools. According to the paragraph, it can notify teachers when students are becoming bored of what is being taught. By the teachers being notified that their way of teaching isn't helping the students learn, they would know to change that teaching habit. By the teachers changing their teaching habits and making it more interesting, students would be more likely to learn the information that they are recieving. Rather than just being bored, sleeping, and waiting for the bell to ring. With teachers changing the way that they infrom students, students will recieve better grades. Therefore, the Facial Action Coding System, could help make the students better informed, and no longer just bored of the subject that they are being taught.

Most importantly, the Facail Action Coding System can help with medical conditions. There are many mental medical conditions, but suicide is one of the largest mental conditions. No one really knows that someone is planning to commit this action because they do not notice the signs. I believe that if we were to use the Facial Action Coding System we could detect things like this faster, and do something about it before something tragic happens. Yes, we humans are able to detect when someone is feeling bad, but we are not always able to tell whether or not someone is faking their happiness. According to the paragraph, the Facial Action Coding System can detect when someone is faking a smile. With the Facial Action Coding System being able to detect this it would enable us to know if someone is truly feeling down. The Facial Action Coding System could help reduce the rate of Suicides in todays society, and even in future generations.

Even though the Facial Action Coding System may not be able to help with everything. It could be the solution to many big problems in todays society. It could help with some of the worlds biggest problems. The Facial Action Coding system could help the law reduce crime rate, give students a better education, and it could help with medical conditions. Altogether, the Facial Action Coding System could be very helpful. It could be the key to many important things, and it can help future generations become smarter and safer.         ",4
acd81a8,"Dear, state sentor

Getting rid of the electoral college would be a bad idea because of the ease it puts on voting and it makes the candidates work harder to becaome president.

When a person runs for president they are trying to take on the hardest job possible, running a country. When they are on their campaign they visit states individual amd they spen alot of time on swing states or the big states such as California, Florida, and Texas. without the electoral college it kinda defeates the purpose for them spending as much time as they do in those states because yes they have a large amount of people but so does every other state, the only large difference now is the amount of electoral votes each one gets. where as with the electoral college they spend more individualized time with each state to try to sway the majority to get all the electoral votes since they cant split them between the candidates. it all comes down to who the smarter candidate is and how they spend time and what they are trying to achive. overall the way it is now makes them wotk harder to win the election. with voting no one likes a tie and without the electoral college that can happen.

In 2000 gore and bush had a fiasco with voting in the presidental election and it was the first time since 1888. Gore who had more popular votes than bush only lost because Bush had the most electoral votes. If it was only up to popular votes than it can easily come down to a tie, what then? recount after recount, or simple debate (but who decides that?). In some cases without the electoral college it could actully make the process because yes they dont have to spend much time campaigning in certain states they get to visit smaller states that tend to get neglected during the campaigns so everyone is more of an informed voter when it comes time to vote. lets say bob and sally campaing against each other and with out the electoral college they can go ariund to smaller states and the big ones and when the voting results are in yes they can be closer or larger apart you also see how america feels whenit comes to politics, yes you can see it with the electoral college but it is a smaller amount of votes so it will always be close but seeing how america feels isnt as easy.

When it comes down to voting  the Electoral College is an over all easier way to vote and makes the candidates work harder to win an already hard election to run the country.                                                                ",3
ced486b,"What is a Electoral College? A Electoral College is a process, not a place. My 3 reasons what is a(n) Electoral College is : Why do we need a Electoral College, Whats wrong with it, and 5 reasons why we choose a president. We have to find out whats going on with this Electoral College. If we don't something might happen. We will find the truth about the Electoral College.

Whats wrong with Electoral College?

Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president ,

according to paragraph 10 . Again they said if you live intexas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. All the votes that people vote for really aren't voting, there just voting for the slate electors. The electors choose which one they will vote for, but is that any fair, for the people, they make a choice to vote, there not being forced to vote by command. People like to vote because they want a new leader or, for instance, somebody like President Barack Obama. He is going into his 6 year as president.

Why do we need a Electoral College?

The Electoral College consists of 539 electors, according to paragraph 3.

A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The Founding Fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and the lection of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

What are the reasons why we choose a president?

The reasons why we choose a president is because of the swing states, and the big states. Swing states is a winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates as we saw in [2012's] election to focus their campaign efforts on tht toss-up states. Next is the Big States, the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virture of the mal-apportionmentof the senate. The Big States are like : Texas, Californina, and Florida. But this doesn't annoy me because people still have a chance to vote whether or not, the votes don't to the congress.

In Conclusion, Electoral College is a well-known thing when to choose a president or vice president or even governer. Elecotral College is important, you can say that because maybe you agree to it but i still don't because the votes aren't really going to the votes to the congress, the votes really go to the slate of governers or the senate but the the senate or congress are really the real people that can choose the president or vice president.

61d4e5b,"Did the author support their idea well in this article? I do believe he did. I saw many reasons as to why we should at least try to go to venus. He gave many reasons as to how Venus is very simillar to Earth and could be inhabited one day. He also gave many reasons as to how it could be dangerous, and why people haven't really been able to do so yet. They mention things about what Venus has done to other space crafts in the past, and what it can do to others now even.

The author gives many reasons as to why Venus is reffered to as Earths ""twin."" He says, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" In this he tells us that Venus is like Earth in the ways of how dense it is and how large it is. He also says that it is occasionally close to us, so that shows us that it could be just like Earth, but with some differences. The author also says in paragraph 4, ""it may have once been the most Eath-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported many forms of like, just like Earth."" With this he is telling us that there could be fossils, or we could one day maybe inhabit Venus if needed, with adaptations of course.

The author also says that the journey would be dangerous. He mentions in paragraph 2 ""each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no space craft has survived the landing for more than a few hours."" In this he is telling us just how dangerous it is, because tipically you would think of a machine being tougher than the human body, but as you think about it you can see just as fast as that machine was destroyed. If that machine was destoryed so quickly imagine how quickly the human body would be. He also says ""not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" This also lets us know how hard it would be to get there and how fast, if the right materials aren't used, something can be destroyed during the trip.

The author then gives us NASA's plan as to how somebody would be able to access Venus in paragraph 5. He tells us that ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would be to allow scientists to float above the fray."" He gives us this idea so that we can think about it being a safer route and that maybe with this method somebody could be able to make it. With his evidence in the previous paragraphs we can conclude it would be very dangerous to land on Venus, but not to be above it. He also gives us a scenario of what it would be like for the scientists floating above. He tells us, ""a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up out of their way.. temperatures would still be toasy at arounf 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth... radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" By telling us this he is saying that it wouldn't be the most comfortable thing, but it would be liveable. He is showing us that it would be possible, and if they really wanted to, they could explore Venus.

In paragraph 8 he mentions that the ""scientist floating above would only give limited insignt,"" with this we can see that there still wouldn't be everythig solved, but we would still be closer than we've ever gotten. He also says in paragraph 8, ""most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" Meaning that the scientists wouldn't be able to photograph anything on Venus to look at later. The scientists would only be able to look at things closet than anybody ever has, but not be able to document any of it. With this we can also see that we wouldn't be able to see what Venus looked like from Earth, making it hard to report back on findings and research.

All in all I beleive the author did support his idea well. He gave the pros and cons and was able to explain everything out. I myself don't know it it would be worth all the money in supplies, but I do think with NASA's idea we can get closer than we've ever gotten before. The conditions would be liveable, but maybe a little uncomfortable, and we could get some good information on Venus. If Venus is as closely related to Earth as the author makes it out to be, then maybe it could be worth a shot, but I am still debating on it. It's nothing the author did, because he did explain and support everything very well, but I've always had very strong opinions on everything.    ",5
546770c,"There are many efforts from different countries to reduce car usage.  Countries like Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States are trying to raise awareness and get people to not use their car as much.  These countries are raising awareness for example by having car-free days, banning driving for a day, turning suburbs into car-free communities, and rasing awareness about how cars affect the enviroment.  These counrties are making the efforts to reduce car usage because they know that there are great advantages if citizens limit their car usage.

In Vauban,Germany, low-car suburban life is their motto.  Car ownership is allowed , but with a price.  As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move to Vauban.  Heidrun Walter says that she is happier without a car and when she did have a car, she says she was always tense.  Vauban is an example of the efforts and new idea that Europe, United States, and elsewhere have to reduce car usuage.  Some advantages of this low-car concept is that now stores are being placed in walking distance and malls and resturants are also within walking distance and close to each other.

Because of air pollution and smog due to cars, Paris had to start banning people from driving certain days.  If you  were caught driving when you weren't suppose to, a fine was inforced.  Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters.  Diesel fuel was the blame of the smog because France perfers diesel over gas.  Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France according to Reuters.  Paris has more smog than most European capitals.  This is really hurting the enviroment.  While Paris was banning cars, congestion was down 60 percent.  Besides car congestion being down 60 percent, other advatages to this car banning was that non-hybrid car companies lost revenue while hybrid and plug in cars were not.  This shows how people are aware of the pollution of cars.  Also, because of the reduced driving, the smog in Paris was cleared enough to stop banning certain vehicles from driving.

A big event in Bogota, Colombia is their car-free day.  Only buses and taxis were permitted.  Violators of the car-free day faced a fine.  The turnout was large even though there was rain.  ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"", said the Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus.  Citizens of Colombia were happy participating in the car-free day.

""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode his bike.  Municipal authorities from all over the world came to see this event. The city's mayor also says that the day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid- 1990's.  The advantage of the car-free day has made parks and sports centers more popular to go to and other advatages is that the old sidewalks are being replaced with new paved ones.  The traffic has also reduced.

In the United States, President Obama goals are to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions.  The Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities.  The efforts to reduce driving is paying off.  A study found that driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.  Mr. Sivak's research shows a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39 year olds getting a liscense.  In New York, there is a new bike sharing program and that can help people to choose to take bike instead of riding in a car.

All these efforts are helping people make the decision to limit their car usage and based on the facts, there are alot of advantages if you limit car usage.  This is only a start to raise efforts to reduce car usage, but I feel in the future we will be seeing a lot more people walking and biking than riding their car.             ",3
058ecd3,"Limiting car usage isnt such a bad idea. For starters, it helps keep a friendly enviroment, it also saves money and time for people to get to know eachother and talk a little more.

To begin with, limiting car usage would help keep a healthy, clean enviroment. In the article, 'In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars' Elisabeth Rosenthal states that ""the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced communtities, and legislatures are starting to act, if cautiously."" Which shows that less car usage would help protect our enviroment. Not only the enviromental agency, but the government and people agree. Also in the article 'Paris bans driving due to smog' Robert states that ""the smog cleared up enough Monday for the ruling French part to rescined the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"" giving us the fact that th esmog from the cars was hurting the eviroment and causing smog and reckless driving.

Secondly, limiting car usage would would save money and gas. In the article, 'Paris bans driving due to smog' Robert Duffer says that ""almost 4,000 drivers were fined-diesles make up 67 percent of vehicles in France."" We all know diesles an expensive gas, that more than half of France has to pay for just to get from place to place. It also proves that reckless driving and smog from cars can cause damage to someones pockets with fines.

Lastly, reduced driving can help people within the same community, get to know eachother better because your either riding around on a bike or walking, giving you the chance to associate with your neighborhood friends. As stated in the article 'Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota' , ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven pitted sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resteraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" which shows that driving had good aspects and helped the communty get along more.

In conclusion, thats why limiting car usage would have a good affect on our communities and a good affect on th ewhole world in general, because it helps keep a friendly enviroment, and it saves money and time for family and friends.    ",3

""Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman.""

""There are 6 basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness......"" These emotions are ""calculated"" per say by looks, movements, and the facial muscles.

069cd67,"An idea for driverless cars does sound appealing. It can improve the intelligence of today's cars by giving them a mind of their own. However, these cars may seem like a decent idea for the future, but they can prove to be really difficult. Quite a few problems can arise from this phenomenon. The development for these driverless cars should cease pretty soon.

In the future, driverless cars are supposed to become a new thing. These cars will have the ability to function on their own and drive itself, which will not really require the driver to handle it. Although this seems like a nice thought, this is quite an issue already. Creating driverless cars can create laziness in lots of people. Assuming that this creation is titled 'driverless', many people will think that they do not have to do anything. This will raise the laziness in some people if this driverless car becomes available. This invention is not a good idea.

As well as it can raise laziness in people, it can quite possibly cause the driver to use it to his/her advantage in inappropriate ways. There is a law that says the driver must be held responsible for any mistakes he/she makes while on the road whether the car is automated or not. The driver will be at fault regardless if any acident is to happen. Even though this law exists, people will still make excuses for their mistakes. If an accident occurs, the driver may use the car as an excuse to avoid any responsibilities, such as court cases if anything is damaged. With such an invention as great as this, someone is most likely going to use it as a scapegoat for their mishaps. This just gives people a reason to avoid being guilty for what they did.

It is said that the car is supposed to maintain its commands and make driving easier. These driverless cars are supposed to work almost efficiently for everyone. However, accidents are still likely to happen. Even if these cars are supposed to work well, things can go wrong. Perhaps the car may somehow malfunction while on the road. If this happens, it will put the driver and other people on the road, driving or walking, at an extreme risk. If a malfunction in the car is to occur, accident and death rates will increase. This is extremely unsafe for drivers in the future.

It sounds great to have a car that can drive itself in the future. Maybe it might raise the intelligence of some drivers. Nevertheless, the possibilities of this new car going wrong should not be ignored. These cars cannot be 100% perfect at all times after its release. It can be unsafe and extremely inaccurate and should not become an invention in the future.",4
a9b6e1f,"Studying Venus is worthy this shows in many way. Venus is known was the 'Evening Star"" and that's why we get light in the night sky. Venus is the second planet from the sun. Itis very challenging place to examine the earth more closely. Even tho Venus is a very challenging planet for humans to study they are proximity to us.

Venus has a wonderful value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet by itself, but also because the human curiosity will lead us tho more equal intimidating endeavors. They have meet very edges of imagination and innovation. The NASA are workig on other new ways to study Venus and to find more information about Venus. They have found out more about through out the time Venus has the hottest surfce temperature of any planet in this solar system. Astronomers are amazed by Venus because it is may well known.

Venus can be our nearest option for a planetary visit. We should all be very thankful for the people who study the planets. There are many more facts about Venus that humans know because of the people who study planets and Venus is the most important one.

59a7bad,"Exploring Venus seems very interesting when thinking about it. All of the beneficial things that we can study and analyze. Studying other planets have always been helpful to mankind and helps people gain insight on our solar system around us. But at the same time exploring these planets are very dangerous too. Not because of animals or humans but because of the harsh living conditions on other planets. So I will tell you why I think exploring Venus is not worth the pursuit of exploring.

My first reason of why I think Venus is not worth the pursuit is because of the difficulty of exploring Venus. In paragrpah 6 it states that ships orbiting over Venus with lights can't see the ground because of the dense atmosphere. Which makes it hard for scientists because if you can't see anything you can't analyze any data that you get because of Venus's features. But it does state that NASA is trying to find new ways of exploring Venus but it's not as good as hands on exploration. Which is good but most likely not good enough to find out what they want about the planet.

My second reason of why I think Venus is not worth the exploration is because of Venus's conditions and features. When reading about Venus the conditions are very extreme compared to the conditions on Earth. Such as clouds filled with highly corrosive sulfuric acid or temperatures that average over 800 degrees. Making it the planet with the hottest surface temperature even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Also the atmospheric pressure is great enough to crush an accustomed submarine that would be able to dive into the deepest parts of the ocean and liquifies metals. But having similarities to Earth such as erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and etc.

So in conclusion I feel that Venus should not be a planet we heavily invest in and scientists should try other planets before Venus. Because of the harsh conditions that it would have on humans. Because of the difficulty in analyzation. Making Venus a non-reliable source compared to others. So that is why I think that Venus is not worth exploring. ",4
d9e6a88,"Is the face on Mars the face of a new discovery in our universe? When a face was discovered on Mars, the idea of it was quite controversial. Generally speaking, the face on Mars was just a pop icon, not a sign of life. The face on Mars was proven to be a simple landform because NASA had photographed it from several angles showing all there was needed to determine, there were no signs of any civilization, and the environment was suitable to form buttes or mesas. The Face on Mars was just a pop icon and a skeptic's thought, not a sign of martian life or civilization.

First of all, in 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to find evidence, when all they found was a natural landform.

The Red Planet was very cloudy that time of year, and theorists believed that the haze was hiding any martian evidence or civilization. However, it is not easy to target Cydonia, because of Mars' natural orbit and the fog and haze Mars receives every so often. So, in 2001, NASA sent the Surveyor back up to Mars to take pictures and investigate.

When the photos were taken, the photos were discerned three times bigger than the pixel size, and no signs of civilization appeared. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program states. Each pixel in the image taken was around 2 meters, when the Viking image taken in 1976 had fourty-three meters per pixel. In 1976, the theories could have been believable, considering that the images taken did not show very much evidence if any.

Finally, the American West was compared to Mars when the ""Face"" was labeled as a butte or a mesa. The American West is sultry, gusty, and somewhat similar to what the environment on Mars is. This environment is the perfect environment to form buttes, due to erosion in the soil and the wind pushing the soil around. The landmass on Mars is not exactly a butte, however. This landmass is the Martian equivalent to what the American West has. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"" says Garvin.

""There hasn't been enough evidence of the Face on Mars to prove it's only a landmass!"" There has been several images taken of the Face to prove it is a formation. However, the image taken in 2001 is the most accurate, considering that the pixels are about two meters by two meters. That is about 22 times more accurate than the picture taken in 1976, showing about fourty-three meters each pixel of Cydonia. If there were any evidence to show up on the Face, it would be shown in the 2001 image.

The Face on Mars is only a martian mesa, not a pop icon or a civilization. It is an extraterrestrial butte because NASA had photographed it from several angles showing all there was needed to prove, there were no signs of any civilization when images were taken, and the environment was suitable to form buttes or mesas. All in all, the Face on Mars wasn't a sign of out-of-this-world autotrophs, but it was just a simple bizarre-shaped butte. The Face on Mars was not only a controversy, but a resolved conflict between conspirors and Cydonia-scholars.",5

The strive to be safer has become one of the main priorities for car manufactures.

The google car has so many electical features that are on the outside of the car and are most certainly water proof, but if it cracks and water getis into the eletrical parts the car would not function properly.

That would become a hazard to the people inside of the car.

Using technology to read one's emotions, in my opinion, is actually really cool. I never thought there was gonna be some kind of advanced technology that could read soneone's emotions. Professor Thomas Huang, and Professor Nicu Sebe have worked on the lastest innovation to percieve emotions. They are also developing new ways for humans and computers to communicate.

Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at devoloping better ways for humans and computers to communicate.""

I think this kind of technology will be very resourceful in the scienece industry. It could help scientists focus more on the characteristics of human emotions. I believe it could also help them to reciprocate with the FACS ( Fcaial Action Coding System).

Having this kind of technology in the classroom will be very beneficial for students, and also fun at the same time. Students can learn and observe the behavior of their classmates as they try to detect any emotions. At first they might be able to read each other's emotions on the first try, but with the FACS, I'm pretty sure that it can detect any hidden emoton or if the students do not show any emotions at all. In the midle of paragraph 6 it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a students is confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructr.""

Some students could use this software on there computer to use for when they have no one to talk to, to use for homework like instead of looking it up on the internet they could say,""hey computer what is two plus two."" This could be the next siri, but on the computer.

For students in a classroom to use this software could be valuable. The article, the psychologists, and the professor tells us the good things about this software. The Facial Action Coding System, we can use it for anything. You can also use it for anamonical information.

The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Yes, we can actually calculate emotions, like math homework. The computer can recognize your emtions through software and through a special program Dr. Paul Eckman created. ",2
4465999,"Dear state senator,

I believe that the United States election should be changed to popularity vote. wouldnt that be easier than a Electoral College? I beleive so and i bet many others also believe that a popularity vote is way better. I stongrly encourage a(n) Popular vote becuase its easier, less complicated, and faster.

Dont you think a popular vote would make it way easier for not just the fellow citizens of America but for you guys? I believe that this would be a great change not for the bad but for the good. The popular vote all you have to do is count and state who had more and bam! its that easy! Its just 123 and your done. Isnt that much easier? Not a long process or any of that. imagine just voting once for the president and being done with all that?

Wouldnt having a popular vote be less complicated? you wouldnt have to do the state elector or have any more requirements. All you have to do is whoever has more wins! also in the Elecoral College the voters dont even vote for the president but  for a slate of electors?? what is that nonsense? shouldnt citizens have the freedom of voting for who they want as president? I thought this was the land of the free? How would bigger states have a voice if it was the same as the smaller ones?

Dont you believe that a popular vote would also be a faster way of the elections? its just 123. Electing electors to vote for you just takes way to long. By the time your done with that you couldve been done with the presidential elections if you wouldve just had a popularity vote from the start. Everything you do is based on time so wouldnt it just be easier for everyone to vote and boom! its all over. Its not just faster for us but for y'all also.    ",3
93ae44a,"In the three stories, What is the electoral college?, The Indefensible Electoral College, and the Defense of Electoral College, each argue wether or not to keep or over throw the electoral Colloge. The Electoral college has been a crutial part of voting who stays or leaves the offic chair of america, But one thing for sure losing this way of voting is very questionable.

In the story, In defense of Electoral college, it eplains five very detailed reasons to keep the electoral college. The certainty of the outcome of this voting system has been accepted for years. Richard A. Posner explains, ""The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exeeds his share of popular vote.""This quote given to us shows the certain possibility of who wins the share of the presidents seat. Each vote by the citizens of America is sent to chose the ""qualified citizens"" to represent their state in th election for president.

The person in the election for president also has to have a appeal to many regions. If the candidate is attempting to gain more votes by stayong in the same region he or she will not gain more electoral votes. When a person runs for president is they go into many regions to pursuade more people to vote on that person for president then they will gain more electoral votes.

The system does have a few errors in its existence. When people are voting someone to represent them they might make a mistake on wich candidate thier voting on. If people did have a direct vote for who becomes president then they have their exact opinion on who becomes president, but the system of voting still stands because most people in America like this way of voting better.

It would be better to have people representing each state with electoral votes because having every vote from every citizen of america sent to an individual slot for who should be president is overwhelming. instead, we have a system where each person votes on a candidate to represent their state in the election. It is a better way of using time wisely in voting for America's new president.

To close, Having the Electoral College system to vote is a fantastic way of showing who should be president for America. The Electoral College  should stay because of the certainty of who will be next president and avoiding the run-off elections to prevent uncertainty of who will be president.                                                     ",3

They have their many pros and cons, like how they still need to be driven by a human to get in and out of a driveway, or to navigate a crash or roadblock, and how it went over 500,000 miles without crashing (paragraph two). This still fairly remarkably, even whilst it is still in it's prototype stage.

Although still proving to be an expensive alternative to normal cars, by being made by brands such as Tesla and Mercedes-Benz, to name a few, the evidence given in the article states that driverless cars can have the potential to be an incredibly safe method of transportation, as compared to human driven cars. They can be proven even safer to both pedestrians and policeman alike, by being utilized by people under the influence of alcohol, to drive home safley, and not harm any people utilizing the sidewalk or other drivers.

Although having to be driven by humans to do things like drive into driveways or navigate traffic, which would ultimatley void my previous statement on how it could protect passersby. Remember that these cars are still in the prototype stage of their lives, and developers are still working hard on making these cars as skilled as a driver as any human. These cars are coming closer and closer to becoming a reality that could be in every house by 2020. Much like everything else, they have their pros, and cons, but ultimatley prove that ve are one step closer to a better, safer tomorrow.",2

Luke had no idea that his life would change. When your a Seagoing Cowboy you travle alot on a boat on the water. Its alot of hard work too. You have to feed and water the animals three times a day. You had to pulled bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower ships . Also the stalls had to be clean. That cept luck busy.

There are good opportunitys that happen when you are a

Seagoing Cow boy. When your saililng to different countries you may find somthing enjoying. Luke got to tour China and got to ride Gondola . When your sailing you may get to see thing you never seen before or try. when your on the ship , some may take two weeks or a mounth and somtimes longer. Did you think Luke just sat around board. He dident. Luke and his the men who were on the boat with him found entertament.

377b41c,"The following essay is an analaysis of the artice ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" and an evaluation of the points that the article brings up. The article describes dangers of visting our neighbour planet venus and ideas of how it could be done.

The author does a great job to describe venus as the Earth's ""twin"", but also as a dangerous planet that is not made for us. He brings up that no spacecraft has survived a landing for more than a few hours, that the atmosphere is 97% carbon doixide, that there are clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, that the plantes surface has an average temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater as it is on the Earth. All these points convinced me that Venus is a planet that is not made for us to be on. Even if he brings up points why we should still go there it seems to me like it would make no common sense. He says that Venus once looked just like the Earth, but for me it doesn't matter how it once looked like because then we would first go into time traveling and that is not what this article is about. The author also brings up that there could be a survivable soulution by having a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the landscapre. I don't think that this is a good idea, because it would take so much work and money just to see things that we can see without a human being there. He mentions that it probably wouldn't even help the scientists that much because we wouldn't be able to take samples of anything or even inspect the ground conditions. So I think that idea is a waste of money and unless there is a really good reason or something specific to look for we shouldn't do it. The author then mentions that researchers are looking for innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute knowledge over Venus. I think that is a good think to do but it can not be an option to send a human up there, because as long as you only send machines it is just money that you send up there, but with all the dangers it is stupid to send a human to Venus. He closes his article with the statement that we have to strive for new knowlegde beyond our Earth and I do agree with that but we have to look out what the dangers are and sometimes things are not possible, because we are very limited compared to the power of the universe.

So I think that we should keep looking for new innovations that can help us explore the universe but we have to accept that we are very small in a big universe and that not everything is possible for us because we are limited, while the universe is not.",4
93427ce,"In this article we have seen that technology has been coming along quiet a bit. I didn't even know that since 2009 driverless cars have been around. Whether we realize it or not they're developing in our society more than we could've ever imagined. Have you ever watched a television show or movie where the car can drive itself? I know what your thinking wow that would be so cool, a self operating car. Believe it or not Google has done that already.

The risk of having cars that operate themselves will result in alot more car crashes for teenagers, and that will result in insurance being increasing for the parents. Everyday there are over 1,000 crashes that involve teenagers being reckless drivers. In the article the author states"" Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" The key word from that statement is alert. Teenages already are not alert the way it is, and now we want to give them the opprotunity to be even more reckless. In today's generation we have the distractions of cellphones, friends, and mostly technology. Most teenages drive with there cellphones and over 2,000 per day get in a car crash because the use of technology behind the wheel.

I personally am against it myself, even though I'm a teenager and think that would be cool. I still have the maturity to realize that being behind the wheel of an automobile is a privelege, and its a big responsibilty. When your behind the wheel of the moving vehicle you need to be an alert driver. Part of being an alert driver is having you hands on the wheels at all times, because at any moment the car could get out of control and the next thing you know you're in a ditch. I think its so fascinating how much technology has come over the years, but today's generation gets overwhelmed with all of the technology that is thrown at us. I would've never imagined Google came up with a Google Car project and to think they've been around sense 2009 is crazy.   ",3
d8b4704,"Everyone has their good times and their bad showing many mixed emotions. People will show emotions, and sometimes they wont. There are so many emotions; bored, happy, sad, angry, confused, scared, and your telling me that this ""Facial Action Coding System"" can detect them all? Putting ""technology to read the emotional expressions of a student"" is a big NO. Even at times we don't know how we feel, how can a computer tell us what we feel.

These computers being able to identify human emotions is scary if you think about it. Over the pass ten years the interenet has become a real popular thing. People use it to socialize and play game, but what happens when someone loses in a game or doesnt agree with what someone else is saying. We have a reaction thats not exspected. People can be very agressive verbaly through the interent. Because of the interent there have been more suisides now then there has ever been. Knowing how you feel could increase the risk of suside and/or thoughts of suiside considering over half of the worlds population has depression. (which can lead to suiside)

Even if this ""Facial Action Coding System"" can detect our feelings what actions are going to be taken. Even though ""Alto"" did say ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

They didn't give any imformation on how they are going to do that. It sounds like when they say ""like an effective human instuctor"" they are refering to a robot which has no expresion in its voice. That would make someone not pay attention even more the voice would be very boring causing the student to doze off even more.

Sometimes Schools are more poor then other and have no way of paying for computers. This softwear ""Facial Action Coding System"" could cost money they never adressed cost in the article. This would also be something that the teacher and students would have to adapt to as well. Where just now getting laptops and Ipads into schools to ""better push education."" I read a study over E-Learning vs Paper. They took a group of students of the same grade level, and split them into two groups. Gave them both the same exact passage with the same exact questions, but one was all on the computer while the other one is on paper. When the results came back from both groups more kids on paper did better. Not only do kids learn better using paper we save money from having to buy computers that may have been broken or damaged.

People need to experince all of these different kinds of emotions to be able to handle these experinces. Without these experinces when something where to happen we wouldnt be able to handle it. If we continue with using ""Facial Action Coding System""

Suiside rates could go up. Using this in classroom could also make students get less infomration by not being able to focus on what's being tought to them.

Not everyone lives in the riches places would this program be able to be funded to schools or pay through the goverment.

This is somthing that we should not go on forward with because doing so may make us suffer the effects of the future causing the people of our future to be looked down upon.      ",5
b75fe1c,"The technology to read emotional expressions of students would be valuable because it could help consulors with their jobs. The reason why is because the computer can read emotiaonal expressions of students so the consulors can use the techology to thier advange. As the text says Mona Lisa was 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted and also 6 percent fearful. Imagine having a consulor having that type of tech in their hands. Their would be less fights less sucdial tenions and aslo less bullying.

The technology could also make alot of students smile. As the text states you can conduct an experiment by going to the bathroom and raise your lips at the conroners of your mouth, then squint your eyes slighty to produce wrinkling at the croners of your eyes. And also by holding that raise the outers parts of your cheek up towrad your eyes. They say doing all those faces and experiments can make a person happy just by trying it. Also putting a happy face on your face could infunces others to try the same thing and get the same resluts.

Also if a techaer wanted to prove that the emotional expression technology is vaulable they could set up a way to let the students use and play with the tech. That would let student exprence and see how the technology works and function so that in the future they would know how to use it to. This information can also take technology and others courses to a different level. The reason why is becuase if students learn how to take contorl of this technology they can try to forge it into their own work of art and make it better than before. as the text says your home PC cant handle the complex alogrithms used to decode mona lisa's smile but we can write down simple instructions that encode different emotions. That states there to me that if students get thier hands this type of tech they could alter the world solve problems in a insict or a heart beat and even help bring bullying to a end. Students may think letting the system read their emations is a bad thing or might them feel uncomfortbale but it shouldn't. It's to help them and the teacher have a better relationship and aslo solve problems faster.",3
34f1c56,"The Electoral College is used in the United States to elect a president, yet it is higly debated over whether it is needed or not. The Electoral College was founded to compromise the election of a president between the people and Congress, to try to avoid problems between both parties. Many people allign themselves with one side to argue that it is needed to eliminate unfair advantages, or that it is not needed because it doesn't give the people the power to elect their president. This brings up disputes and controversy especially in situations that give evidence to support both cases, such as the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George Bush. The Electoral College should be kept in use because it provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote.

To begin with, the Electoral College should be in use because it provides fair representation for all the states involved in the election. ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" ""This is a desireable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" This shows that it is beneficial because it makes a candidate who has only regional appeal, have to work harder in other states to show that he would be fair to all states, not just the ones that support him. Furthermore, it allows for massive regional advantages, like the South, mean nothing because they would still have to convince the North to vote for them. The opposing side might argue that if a candidate has regional appeal, they should just let that win them the election, but a successful president should be able to sway the whole country into voting for him, not just a certain region. Thus, showing that regional advantages prove meaningless with the Electoral College, making it less unfair to other regions.

In addition, the Electoral College eliminates the unfair advangate of having a bigger state, allowing smaller states to have a significance in the election."" The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" This shows that large states can sway the whole election, while small states don't make a dent on it, without the Electoral College in place. Thus, using it allows smaller states' votes to matter in the election, while eliminating large states' advantage over them. People might claim that large states deserve more representation because more people live in them, but this doesn't preserve the equality for other smaller states's citizens that the United States stands for. This makes it apparent that without the Electoral College only the ""big states"" would matter and the candidates wouldn't have to worry about the small states.

Finally, the Electoral College does its best to eliminate the issue of not being able to determine the winner when the majority vote does not differ. "" Most states have a winner-take-all system that  awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" This stops the problem that occured in 1968 with Nixon and 1992 with Clinton, and provides a clear definite way to choose the winner. If the Electoral College wasn't in use, lengthy recounts and much controversy would follow elections to try to determine if the votes were fair; this would cause too much strife and unrest within the country. It can be argued that even with the conflict it provides the people a chance to make their votes count, but it does more harm than good and it doesn't truly change anything. As a result, the Electoral College solves the issue of uncertainty and significance of vote.

In essence, the Electoral College is necessary for the balance and order in the United States to remain. It provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote. This all shows that fewer problems arise when using this procedure, rather than if they use majority vote. ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" This shows that the citizens still have power in choosing their candidate and it creates a balance with other parties. In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept to preserve the integrity and equality the United States is all about.    ",6
75296c2,"In my opinion I think that this ""Face on Mars"" is a landform. For one, we have never seen an alien or have any trace of aliens. I think that we think it has something to do with aliens because it is in a face shape like us. But honestly, huge rocks or huge meterorites could have caused it to look like that. Also there hasn't been any sight of life on Mars because of the conditions. If humans couldn't live on Mars, then how could aliens?

Huge rocks and huge meters crash into the planets and moon all the time. I honestly think that it is the rocks or something in space that caused this. I don't think that there is any sight or any posssible way that there could be life or aliens on this planet.

When they went to go see again and go check out the ""Face on Mars"" they didn't see anything, there was no alien monument. They also talk about how it is very hard to be able to see the ""Face on Mars"" I think that if there was a possiblity that it could be a bout aliens and this ""Face on Mars"" appeared because of aliens then there wouldn't onlly be one face. I think that if there were tons of face looking landforms then maybe there could've been life on mars for aliens. Since there were no other faces that could've been another alien, I don't think that there is a way that this has anything to do with aliens.

Cydonia and Mars had once crashed into each other and created a weird shaped. Years later the shape wore off and created a human shaped face.

a4c3fff,"Once, driverless cars were something that no one thought possible; but today, they are becoming more and more plausible to see on the road in just a few years. The development of these cars could lead to a safer road environment, and a better experience for former drivers. This could be done by improving safety over manual cars, and even by adding forms of safer entertainment.

In order to alert the passenger in the first place, the smart car would need to have a complex system of sensors. With these in place, the car could sense the speed, the engine function, and have a constant 3D analysis of the car's surroundings. This could allow for the car to sense danger in objects in all directions, as well as dangerous speeds and engine problems. These systems could detect and alert a human passanger much faster than the human could detect or even realize the issues before they cause an accident.

These cars would include necessary safety measures in order to make sure the passenger would not be put in danger in case of emergency. Though these smart cars would be able to accelerate, break, and sense danger on their own, they still would need a human to take over to steer clear of trouble. This could be done by alerts the car has from it's censors such as flashing lights or vibrating seats to get the passenger's attention to take over. This could most certainly prevent accidents before the human even would fully realise the danger.

What about being bored while your car drives itself? Doesn't a smart car take the fun out of driving? Of course not, is the answer. Smart cars could provide a new kind of entertainment aside from just the radio or the TV in the back seat. They could give the same feeling one would have with a smartphone at a handsfree, simple, and most of all, safe experience. All including a feature that shuts all entertainment off when alerting the passenger of danger, leading this to be much safer than using a cellphone at the wheel.

Smart cars could give us many things that make us feel safe, happy, and entertained; Safety features such as censors and alerts make us feel safe, while new forms of entertainment keep us happy when experiencing the driverless car. These cars are soon coming into the modern world, and we are well on our way to excepting them as safe, reliable vehicles.

8388adc,"You're walking into a classroom seeing different faces, different attitudes, and different emotions. Do you think you'll be able to tell the emotion of each student? What if you were sitting in a classroom? Do you believe a computer or any technology that's able to read you and your classmates emotional expresionsis valuabe? If you do, then I disagree.

I believe the use of technology that's able to read the emotional expressions of students isn't valuable.First, I believe this because the software is able to show only six emotions. In the article, it states, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness,"" This shows that emotions like empty or basic won't be shown. If these emotions aren't shown, then what would the system show for an empty-feeling person.

Next, I believe this system isn't valuable because some people can have deceiving faces. In the article, the author, D'Alto says, ""...and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" This shows that the system is using people's facial expression to tell their emotion. A student can have a bored look on their face, but be very interested in what's going on at the same time. Therefore, the system will believe the student is bored, even though the student is far from it.

Finally, I believe this system isn't valuable because no mater what emotion a person is feeling, some people just have a natural neutral face. In the fourth paragraph it says, ""Each expression is comapred against a neutral face."" This shows that when a person has a neutral face they're only showing no emotion. Even though a person shows no emotion, deep down inside they might be happy or sad without anyone knowing.

This is why I believe the Facial Action Coding Sysytem is not valuable at all. The system is only able to show basic emotions. The system can't detect deceiving faces. This system clarifies the neutral face as no emotion. I hope you agree.",4
45f85d6,"It's that time of year again. The election of the president of the United States! But does our vote really matter? I mean the Electoral College does all the voting anyway. So should we change the Electoral College to popular vote for the president or, keeping it the way it should be senator?

To commence, the Electoral College is pretty much the way the president is elected.

There are currently 538 electors in the Electoral College (Source 1). And in order to win the presidency you need to have at least 270 electoral votes. But why is it like that? In the 2000 U.S. election Al Gore had more popular votes than George W. Bush did nationwide. But he lost the election because Bush had 271 electoral votes compared to Gore's 266 (Source 2). The Electoral College is widely known for being unfair but, there is a reason for that. Number 1 is the Certainty of Outcome. It's less likely to dispute over the popular vote than it is than the electoral vote. The reason is because of the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. (Source 3).

On the other hand, some Americans have five reasons to keep our horrendous way to elect our president. A Certainty of outcome. It is stated in Source 3 that it is less likely to have a dispute of electoral votes than popular votes. And it's because of the winning candidate's share of popular votes. Everyone's President. It's stated that the Electoral College requires to a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The South and Northeast region don't have enough electoral votes to elect a president. So Romney had no incentive of campaining in the South. Swing states. The winner-take-all method is popular in each state in the U.S. Giving the winning candidate to win the presidency. The ""toss-up"" states are more likely to pay more attention to the campaign. 4 Big states. Larger states are more likey to have more electoral votes than smaller states. In contrast, Florida and Wyoming. Florida has 29 and Wyoming with only a mere 3 electoral votes. Avoid run-off elections. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.

Hence, senator there is no need to change the Electoral College to popular votes. Although, many Americans despise the way it works. It still manages to elect a president in an unfair way.            ",3

They found all forty-four major muscles, the movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit on the computer.

If the FCAS was used in school it can be a benifit to students and teachers. It can show how student are acting in class to see if they're under standing or not. If someone isn't understanding then the teacher can see and talk more on that subject. If the students id doing an assinment on the computer and get the answer wrong and see confusion the system could reword the question and see if that's easier.

If the student stil doesnt understand the problem or the subject, the robot could go and get him/her and say to them "" So and so needs your help on this problem or on this subject."" And the teacher would go help them.

Well the robot could malfunction in the middle of class and and go roge and start herting people. Well if that happended then their would be someone on stand by to turn off the robot and start working on him. So the robot could get back as fast as he could. Well what if that person is sick one day and the robot goes beserk. Then we will have a second person on stand by.

The robot would be good in the classromms. This Coding could be good for students and teachers. If someone has an IEP, the robot could tell the teacher that the studnet needs more help than the other students. Well the robot could malfunction in the middle of class and go roge and start herting perople. This could be very good for the class room.                          ",3

The author gave no reason or claim to why a dangerous trip to venus would benefit us in any way. The author of this article does include evidence and facts about how hard it would be to get to Venus and all the challenges we would have to undergo to get to Venus.

In this article the author claims that going to Venus is hard but worthy. What makes Venus so worthy? ""often referred to as earth's ""twin"", Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of denisty and size."" says the article of this passage in paragraph 2. but then in paragraph 2 he states that Venus has a ""thick atmoshpere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets"" and ""clouds of highly corrosive sulfiric acid"" ""temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and "" atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". The author gave all this evidence of the challenges we were facing to get to venus but he does not say why it is beneficial to us. he gives us more reasons to not want to go to venus.

in conclusion, this author does not support his claim of venus being worthy despite all the dangers and challenges it brings. There is no text evidence or even a reason to go to venus. the author has to include more of the benefits we can get from going to venus, instead of giving us all the challenges. ",2
f30e77e,"Dear Florida State Senator,

We, the people have been given the Electoral College in order to allow both us and congress a say on who will be the next face of our country. I know that you should not fix what is not broken, but maybe it time to allow some changes in our election. The Electoral College attempts to maintain a fair voting process, but like many great ideas it comes with a few kinks.

""Non-swing"" states have it rough when its time for voting season, because their chances of ever getting their voice heard are slim to nothing. In the second source; paragraph thirteen, the Office of the Federal Register mentioned that candidates spend their time on ""swing"" states due to them having a better chance of suceeding there than, ""non-swing"" states. This is unfair to the citizens of those states not being able to get a word in, let alone a simple acknowledgement of who they may be voting for. Even in the third source; twentieth paragraph, the 'OotFR' mention that only those few lucky states chosen will receive more information on the candidates than those unfortunate few who were discarded like an old newspaper.

Votes are solely dependent on the electors of the states, as shown in paragraph ten of source two. Voter often get confused over who they are placing their votes towards,often voting for the wrong candidate or have no control, whatsoever. In the following paragraph, John F. Kennedy was in trouble back in 1960 because of the LA state legislature nearly got new electors so that most of Kennedy's popular vote would not be received at all. Overall the electors play crucial part in the Electoral College, but must could not trusted to hold that much responsibilty.

All-in-all, the Electoral College contains  some flaws, which is normal. I'm not asking for you to abolish it altogether, but compromise and evenly distribute the power of the votes and who gets a say on what is happening.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME                    ",3
9c76a86,"Driverless Cars are Coming is a story about cars that don't really require a human driver. It talks about the history of driverless cars and how far they have come. It also gives some examples of some driverless cars. However, in the story it describes how these driverless cars have some positive and negative aspects. I believe that these cars have positive aspects and should be developed more because they are able to mimic the same skill of a human at the wheel, the drivers will be more alert, and they have a lot of safety functions.

To begin with, I am for the development for the driverless cars because they are able to mimic the same skill of a human at the wheel. For example, in the story it says, ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial notion sensor. The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.""

In addition, the next reason I am for the development of driverless car is because the drivers will be more alert. For example, in the story it says, ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."" The story also says, "" The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" Finally, one last example from the story is when it says, ""Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver.""

Finally, the last reason I am for the development of driverless cars is because they have a lot of safety functions. For example, in the story it says, ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over---something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" Also, another example the story says is, "" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.""

In conclusion, I am for the development of driverless cars because they are able to mimic the same skill of a human at the wheel, the drivers will be more alert, and they have a lot of safety functions.                        ",3

58f18bb,"I think that we should have this Facial Action Coding System. It can make teaching much easier for a teacher and learning much easier on students. The FACS can change just about everything we know about human emotions. This could be a new way to help people in classrooms and people with depression.

Since this FACS was made we are able to better understand how people are feeling. Wethier its in the classroom helping the teacher better engage his or her students into there lesson, or its helping someone who dosent want to show emoting get help with something thats bothering them.Since the face can show so much more emotion than we can normally see we are able to see deeper down at what they are actually feeling. As in paragraph 6 it quotes ""A Classroom coumputer could recognzer when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrutor."" Knowing that many people dont want to be in a classroom there whole day this system will be able to change there action of study to where its more enjoyable for the student to sit there and actually learn about the material.

As it goes to show the FACS would be a great thing to have because it would greatly help out in so many different ways. With this new technology we will be able to better our school learning systems. We will be able to better our world with better learning systems.",3
1c6bf32,"I think it will be good in a couple years because some people can't really drive without help because the sensors will be more advance. It can really do wonders to peoples lives in the future such as going out easier being safe and more efficient. But you still need a driver's license if you want to drive a smart car because when there is a something major going on the car can't sense what other people are going to do. I really think it can do good in the future with the more advance sensors on the cars and we may have better technology. I think it can do real good in this world like herlping people that can be hurt or in pain.

In paragraph 5 and 7 they have great detail of how it will help advance more in the future. In paragraph 7 they said,""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" They are not fully there yet on the selfless driving subject but they will be soon because in paragraph 5 has detail on that because it said,""Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect amd respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from thr sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a humman driver could manage alone. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" It will be advanced in the future.

I really hope one day it will happen because we are damaging the plant by using the cars we are using now. It will damage the future for our children and future generations by doing what we are doing we need stop it because we don't want to have future generation clean up what we already can clean up now. So I do hope and dream the smart car can help with this problem in a couple years. Just help save the plant and leave it clean for generatons to come.              ",2
9265080,"This new technology to allow us to read students emotional expressions is brilliant. Reasons being is it allows students to show their true emotion regardless if they act happy, or sad. This will more likely have less kids hide their emotion and can truly be worked on. It can be the difference between life or death. To prove that this technology can be used in advance, most of us know the famous picture of the Mona Lisa. Using this advance system most people will say she is just happy and smiling, 'but she's actually 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry'. Obviously we have more then one feeling but this is an prime example of showing this can work on other people and pictures from years ago and still show their full emotions, most people can claim to be happy a lot and be completley devasted.

Did you know that in the Electoral College there has to be a total of 538 Electors. Most of 270 votes are needed to elect a new president. Each canidate running for president has there own group of elector. The peresidential Election happens every four years on the tuesday after  the first monday in november. then we all vote and they do all these tallying on how much electoral votes they got. Not all people agre with the voting system some say its not what we the people really want sometimes. Some People belive that it is the Electors who get to choose.

Some people belive its not fair.

We belive its not far because the electoral are using us for our votes we dont get anything out of it. The state legislature is the one who picks the electors. They are chooseing people they knoe will not be our side. The electoral college is unfair to voters beause of the winner take all rule. The electoral college is unfair,outdated and irrational.

Electoral college method of selecting the presidents messes with potentional voters alot .The Electors Has no hope for who they are eleted  for they just do what they have to do to get there votes. Knowing there vote wll have no affect .

All electoral  college voters vote for a slate of electors who elect the president .The Electors can be anyone not gholding public office.

4af3457,"A computer can tell the Mona Lisa painting is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. A computer is a complex machine with almost everything in it. A computer stores information like what sites you have been on, documents, and more. It also lets you get information in less than five seconds, but is this a good idea to use in classrooms with students? By looking at the reading ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" we can see how computers are helpful when it comes to students' expressions; the teachers can change the lesson up to make it more exciting on the spot.

The software that can read people's emotions is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang, who worked with Professor Nicu Sebe on this project. They are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an 'action unit.' Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" All of their research on human expressions went into this software. They noticed your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you are surprised and your orbicularis oris tightens when you show anger. By using the software on the Mona Lisa painting, they predicted how she was feeling. She was more happy than angry according to the software, but by looking at the painting, a human can not tell if she is happy, angry,or sad. The computer can tell us how she is feeling by acknowledging her muscles in her face. This software can also tell us when a student is happy, confused or bored, and it will help the teacher adjust the lesson for the student. ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confued or bored.' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". The technology can help a teacher and a student succeed together by telling each other how they are feeling even if they do not talk during class. Most students raise their hands to answers questions, but a student will not raise their hand to say ""I'm bored"". Some students do not want to tell the teacher they are confused either. Hence for the computer will automatically tell the teacher and they can explain the lesson better to the whole class because there are always multiple students who need extra help, but will not ask. There for, their software will make humans interact more by telling us how they are feeling.

In conclusion, the software Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe will help read students' emotional expressions. The software has information on how a humans' muscles move when they are happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprised, confused, etc. By using it on the Mona Lisa, we can see that the software works and it will also help find problems in it. Dr. Huang predicts that the software will also help the teacher know when a student is confused or bored. The teacher can then adjust their lesson to make the student more attentive. This will help the teacher succeed in their job more, the lesson more informational, and the student more productive in their school work.",3
5cddf0d,"Cars have been used almost everywhere around the world to help us with our daily lives, like getting us to get to any where we want in a short amount of time. Though there are many beneifts to having a car,there is a price to pay, such as greenhouse gas. Many of us have been so accustomed to having a car, that not having one seems like it will make life complicated as it is. However that is not necessarily true, because just like there are benefits to having a car, there are benefits to limiting car usage.

For example, in Vauban, Gemany 70 percent of the family's in the community do not own any vehicle as a result of street parking, driveways and home garages being generallly forbidden, and 57 percent have sold their car to move there. A benefit that has come from cars being banned is some like Heidrun Wlater, a media trainer and mother of two, felt much happier without a car as oppossed to when she had a car she always felt tense.

However, Vauban is not the only commmunity that has used a movement called ""smart planning"", which is the separation of suburban life from auto use. The trend is growing in Europe, in the United States, as well as other places. Experts say that the method is an effort to greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. In places like Europe, passengar cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. While places in the United States that has a high car usuage number is responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition to greenhouse gas emmisions, the usuage of cars is causing smog in places, such as Paris, where driving has been ban due to days of having a near-record pollution. However, with the exception of usuage for plug-in cars, hybird, and cars carrying three or more passengars. According to Reuters, research shows that Paris has more smog than other European capital. As a result of the ban, car traffic was down 60 percent in the capital. Furthermore, many delivery companies lost revenue. However, the benefit to ban of the usuage of cars is the smog cleared up enough for the ruling French party to lift off the ban on odd-number plates on Tuesday.

Moreover, just like in Europe, in the United States, President Obama wishes to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produce. The United States is well-known for its car culture. However, research has shown that Americans are buying less cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as the years go by. Part of the reason for this outcome is the result of the recession, which led to Americans not being able to buy new cars and unemployed did not need the use of the car since they were not going to work anyways. If the pattern of the usage of cars continues the way it's going many sociologist belive it will have a beneficial use on the reduction of carbon emissions and the environment.

In conclusion, though having a car seems to make life easier. It has a negative effect on our environment. Furthermore, there are benefits to not having a car, such as being less stressed, reducing greenhouse gas emission, and creating a better environment.    ",4
d4d8077,"The advantage of limiting car usage is that we get to save the world because less cars are used. As less the better because gas its bad for earth. 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. As Mr Goldberg said ""How much you drive is as important as wether you have a hybrid."" In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine (In the united states that is $31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. 27 people got their veichles impounded because of the reason they reacted to the fine.

In Bogota, Colombia millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day. Leaving the streets of this capital city mistirious devoid of traffic jams. That was the three years in a row that cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The people that ignored that faced a $25 fine.

President Obama's ambitious goals to crub the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled. A fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior, recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Researchers are wondering if people have been peak driving. Rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down  two to three years before the downturn. A lot of sociologists believe that the percent of cars owned per personper household will go down.    ",2
45d004a,"Dear Senator,

On the issue of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote, I think it is both necessary and unnecessary to keep it the way even if it has been since the founding fathers established it in the Constitution many years ago. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. It only requries 270 of those votes to become the winner of the Electoral College. electorla college is good for the voting process by allowing the qulified people to vote for who they want in office. If we get rid of electoral college then we might not have as many well educated people voting for who gets put in office.

Even if we have the electoral college that dosnt always mean that we will for sure win the election. In 2000 Al Gore won the popular votes but did not win the presidency. There are just a few things that would maybe make the electoral college a little unfair. The state voters do not directly vote for the president, they vote for the electors, who in return vote for the president. State electors are chosen by,sometimes going to state conventions ,the state's party's committee, or even sometimes the presidential canditdates themselves. So with that being said it may be unfair to vote straight for electors and just vote for the president directly. Another thing that would make it unfair because of the ""winner takes all"" system in every state candidates them selves dont spend time in the states that they are repersenting.

What happens if there is a tie in the voting of the electors? In a case like that it would go to the house of repersentatives. If we do it by popular vote than we would not have to worry about there being a tie. People would be able to vote for who they wanted and that would be settled before it even started. If you think that a tie is not likely well in 1976 a tie would have happened if just a small number of votes, 5,559 would have just voted the other way. So saying that the electorla collage way of doing it has its upsides and its down sides. It is outdated and irrational.    ",3

However, a third photo of the Face was taken on April 8, 2001 ""a cloudless summer day in Cydonia [the region of Mars where the Face resides]"" (10) tat also clearly shows that the Face on Mars is not a face at all, but simply a natural land formation.

The Face of Mars is nothing more than a natural land formation. ""'[the Face on Mars] reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,'"" (12). If the ruins of an alien civilization actually existed on Mars, NASA would reap a great benifit, meaning that there would be no reason to hide the discovery. The first picture showing the Face on Mars as merely a natural landform was dismissed by skeptics because the time of year the photo was taken gave the camera a layer of haze to look through to see the face. This haze, skeptics said, hid the alien markings from view. However, this was disproven in April 2001, when a new photo was taken during the clear summertime on Mars. This photo still showed that the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural formation similar to the mesas of Earth.",3

At first scientists figured that the face was just nother martian mesa, common enough around cydonia, only this one had unusaul shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh. In the article it states that a couple of days later they saw the huge rock formation which looked like a humans head but really it was the form of the shadowns that created the rock looked like it had eyes, nose, and even a mouth. The rock was not created by aliens it just was a formation of the rock and diifrent shadows but lots of people seem to like it. Scientists know that the rock really was just made like this and know aliens did not create this this rock. But some people believe other things on how this rock some how looks like a face.

Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. But there were people who still believed that aliens did this and that the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.",2

The Electoral College is a crucial part of the United States's election process. There are some negatives to the Electoral College but the positives outweigh them by a landslide. The certainty of the outcome and having a president that the majority likes are key beneficial factors to the Electoral College process that would be lost if we changed the election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

With the Electoral College, there is a very rare chance that there would be a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. However, according to

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible--it happened in 2000--but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" A clear winner will always be produced with the slight innormality of a tie. In 2012's election, Barack Obama received 51.3% of the popular vote compared to the 61.7% of the electoral vote. If the election process was by popular vote, it would have been a much closer race between Obama and Romney.

To win the Electoral College vote, each region must like you. You cannot have a presidential candidate that favors one region and only one region favors that candidate.

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner states, ""...a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" In contrast,

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer claims that even ""at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.""

What Is the Electoral College?

by the Office of the Federal Register says, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President."" Because of the number of electoral votes each state has is based on population, meaning Texas has more votes than Rhode Island, every presidential candidate focuses on winning over the big states. The big states are a better representation of our nation's opinion. The Electoral College process should not be replaced by the popular vote due to the extremely rare chance of a tie. It should remain because an outcome is certain and majority of the population would like the president.    ",4

First, Venus is closest to earth. They also says the venus is the seconds planet from the sun. They also says that the Venus is the brightest in the night sky light. In paragraph 1 says that"" In our solar system, Venus is the second planet that is from the sun. Venus can be easly seen from the distance but save vantage point of earth"".

Then, 97 persent of carbon dioxide blankeds the venus. When there is a lots of carbon dioxode blankeds it more challenging. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The temperature on planet average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planets in our solar system, Mercury is closer to the sun but somehow the Venus is the hottest planet.

Next, Our sister planets. Astonomers are fascinated by Venus, Because it may well once has been

the most earth-like planets in our solar system. Venus still has some features that are analugous to those on earth. Then I think it mean that the Venus is like our earth planet, I wonder if there is a plant on Venus just like earth. NASA has one particular compelling idea for senting human to stusy the Venus.

In conclution, sciecties suggests people to study the Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it present. They also say that Venus is closest to earth. 97 persent of carbon dioxide blankeds the venus.Our sister planet is very inhospitable.   ",1
bd968ac,"Limiting the usage of car's would have many good outcomes. There would be less polution in our air, it would lower the usage of our fossil fuels and People would live heathier lives without all the smog in the air to cause illnesses.

If all areas of the united states banned or limited the vehile uses here it could greatly reduce the polution in our air. Which would in a long term result cause for better health conditions in people, but we'd sooner realize better health in young childern and the elderly. We would all have cleaner safer air to breath. But it would also help with the enviroment, the number of plants an animals harmed by polution would begin to decrease until the was just a fraction of the amount there is in this time now.

Also limiting the usage of cars will lower our use an burning of precious fossil fuels that once we use them up they are gone. Which this would also save us mass amounts of money that we we could use to keep this country out of debt. Limiting the use of cars will also stop us from having to get our fosssil fuel (oil) from other countries an having debts and money issues with all these other contries. We need to realixe that the usage of fossil fuels all these cars we have is draining our planet which is our home, what are we going to do when its a waste land after we suck all its nature fossil fuels an resources out of it.

Lastly the limiting of cars in the united astates would eventually cause for better health conditions in everyone but we'd sooner realize it in young childern an elderly adults. They wouldn't have such hard times breathing that they do have now causes by all of the polution in our air now. It would take some time but eventaully we'd have cleaner fresher air to breath and this would help decrease the amount of smog an decrease the amount of people with respatory health issues.

These are all things we need to be thinking about when we go into a discussion of limiting car usage these are not the only reasons there are many many more that can be used to help push the movement of limited car use.    ",3
b8fbfa6,"Bob is out drinking with his friends, he decides that he should go home and get ready for work the next day. Bob gets in his car and heads home, not realising how under the influcence he was, he does not notice the semi taking the corner and Boom, Just like that Bob is dead, his wife has to get a job and his kids are missing their father. It could have all been prevented with the introduction of driverless cars. Autonomous cars are more reliable, more effective, and safer than modern vehicles.

Autonomous cars will be much more reliable than common cars. Google has had cars out that have been semi-independent sine 2009. While the cars do have drivers for some issues such as complicated traffic the car does the majority of the work. With slight developments the cars have the potential to be fully autonomous. One easy solution to this is to simply have the cars GPS connect to the local news studio and hire people in that building to update the GPS to show heavy traffic and road work so the car can just avoid them.

Recent developments have made the cars more effective as well, for example they would offer much more flexibility than your avarage bus. The bus has a set route of stops and pick ups, wherein the car could pick people up at the bar and take them safely home. This not only reduces the amount of tickets, but it also saves lives. Think how great the world would be without people dying to drunk driving. Not only that but the cars also consume less gas and require less people.

Speaking of people, The cars would be much safer than your avarage taxi, people never know the whole story behind a cab driver. It's possible that a cab driver isn't a certified cab driver, found the taxi sign at a junkyard, painted his car yellow. This leaves people in a dangerous spot when calling a cab on the streets of new york. A driverless car could pick people up and there would be no danger for the user. Another part that makes the car safer is that it can sense things better than a human can. This cars are outfitted with a massive quantity of sonars and sensors to check for other vehicles. Not only is the car safer for the person inside it is also safer for everyone else. A smart car will never have road rage, as it is a computer, without the capability to feel it will never get angry. A smart car won't run people off of the road because its feelings got hurt.

In conclusion, Autonomous cars are very reliable, effective, and safe. Think of all the Bobs in the world who because of one bad decision have not only lost their life but ruined the lives of those who loved them. it is possible that autonomous cars can prevent it from happening in the future. Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes such cars can fundamentally change the world. Do you want to help change the world for a brighter safer tomarrow.        ",4

Why do the state of senator wish to take away electoral college votes? because they think there is to much voting bc under the electoral college system voters vote not just for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. but who pick the electors? who are the electors? the electors can be anyone that not holding public officean they pick the electors by the state. that how voters sometimes get confused about electors and vote. But the outcome of all this is that electoral college vite is possible an its less likely to dispute over the popular vote. A electoral vote is possible because the total number of vites is 538 is an even number. So to rap it all up it can be argued that the electoral collge method of selecting the president may turn off pontenial voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. so state senator i think we should keep the electoral college.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ",1

c817b31,"As we look back through the records of histroy, humans have made and continue to make an extraorindary advancment in technology. These transformations in technology have worked and cooperated with humans to make life better. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" new advancements in self-driving cars are presented. Though there are many drawbacks of the idea as of right now, humans will make another historial breakthough as they always have. I believe the idea of driverless cars should be promoted due it being more safe, efficient, and helpful to our everyday lives.

The first reason of why I support driverless cars is because of how much more safer it is. If you look out to our world today, machines have replaced so much of what used to be the works of humans. That was because of machines being more capable of precision and safety. Many factory works have been transferred over to machines who do not have to rely on anyone else and additionally does not have to be concerned about safety. In the same way, we can see how much more safe driverless cars are. Google has proven this because their ""cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" In our world today, there are car accidents occuring every minute of our lives. If we can reduce the amount of accidents through driverless cars, then the lives of people will be more safe. Because of how driverless cars can ensure the safety of humans, I support it.

The second reason why I defend the idea of driverless cars is because of how dependent society can be towards these cars. Although driverless cars are not as developed as we wish to, they will be completed to perfection in the near future. With driverless cars being perfected by manufacturers, they will be more cooperative as they can coordinate themselves with other driverless cars so accidents will not happen, and they will find out the shortest distance and time to a certain destination. Google's cofounder Sergey Brin envisions of a more sophisticated car that enables more efficientcy than that of the human: ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world."" With the development of these cars, they can replace all the cars humans drive with a great transportation system for public-transport and commuters. I support driverless cars because of how they can steer the world into a better place.

Lastly, I endorse self-driving cars because of how helpful it will be to humans. If you were in in an emergency situation where you couldn't drive but needed to go to a hospital, driverless cars would literally save your life. Not only that, but if you are a child and you have no one that can drive you to your game, or grocery store, or friends house, you never have to ask anyone ever again for a ride. A driverless car would always be there to help you in your times of inconvenience. Because of how convenient driverless cars can be, it is one more step of why I defend driverless cars.

No matter how crazy an idea or an invention of technology may be, they were made to make the lives of humans better. Every invention had its own times of adversity: The lightbulb, computers, planes, and even the car itself. Every piece of technology had to go through numerous amounts of trial and error to become what it is today. This concept applies to driverless cars as well. We are merely in the stage of development and trial and error so that driverless cars can be made to perfection for the comfort of human lives.

Some cities have even stopped using cars altogether, many of the townspeople believe that cars just cause more stress in peoples lives (Source 1).

In Colombia, the Day Without Cars is becoming more and more popular each year. It's a great way to lower stress and air pollution (Source 3)!

Since 2005, car usage in America has gone down every year, with less people getting a license and less cars being bought each year (Source 4). It begs the question: are cars growing away from our culture? Many people would rather use public transportation or car-pool with friends than drive to work or other activities. Public transportation traffic is woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety (Paragraph 43).

So maybe you should ask yourself if driving really is the best way to go, because it only causes stress, pollution, and it's a danger to your safety every time you drive onto the road. Maybe it's just best to limit car usage and pull out the old bicicle or take the bus and meet new people.                ",1
df590e7,"The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" mentions may things about all the problems with going to Venus. Then, it is said how those problems could be fixed. These are all to support the authors claim. From examining the risk vs. reward of going to mars for exploring that was used in the text and the simple soutions that have baffled the world for 3+ decades, it's clear that the author got through with the message he was trying to convey.

What I've learned fromt the text is that traveling to Venus for a fair amount of time could be a very momentus event in history, but it will be very arduous to reach that goal. There were several dangers listed; temperature, air pressure, lightning, volcanoes, etc. ""While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely"". (Paragraph 1) These were also problems that were tackled by the author. He relenquishes all of the huge problems and proves that going to Venus could be worth it.      ",2
e2f56d4,"In Columbia, Germany, and Paris they are trying to limit the usage of cars in many ways so that they can improve the air and promote alternate transportation.

By reducing car usage like they did in paris where they made people with even numbered license plates leave there cars at home then the next day did the same thing to people with odd numbered licence plates. People who dident follow this rule were fined twenty-two euro's or thirty-one dollars. About 4,000 people did not folow the rule and got fined and about 27 of them got detained due to the reaction they gave when recieving the fine. By implementing this in Paris it brought down congresion by sixty percent after five days. This is a reason why car usage should be limited.

Germany is trying to. In a city called Vauban, cars are banned. You can own a car which you can park in one of two garages the town has on the outskirts but it cost 40,000 dollars so people tend to sell there car. In the town stores are built down the main road in walking distance due to the fact that there are no cars. This town is an experimental new district, on the outskirts of freiburg, close to the french and swiss borders. The town is totaly ""Car-Free"" if you dont count the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown freiburg runs. If this town spreads around the world and othere towns and cities implement the same idea we could lower pollution and better the enviorment. If we build everything closer there will be o nead for cars so thats another reason why we should limit car usage.

In columbia they implemented a car-free day where every one took buses, road bikes and other neat things to get from place to place. This program is wanted to spread to other countries. In the third straight year of implementing this idea they banned all cars on that day except buses and taxis. The goal is to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. Violaters faced a twenty-five dollar fine. Aside from the occasinal rain storms, this idea is a good way to ""take away stress and lower air pollution."" said ny businessman Carlos Arturo plaze as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. For the first time two othere columbian cities join the event. The cites are Cali and Valledupa. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictios have dramatically ut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" This is all in result of that event. Quoted from sorce 3.

As you can see there are many was to reduce air pollution and promote alternate transporation. By taking away cars alternate transportation is needed to fulfil that tasks that need to be done throghout the day and without the exaust of so many cars going off the air pollution will go down too.

I can also see how your mind could come to thinking that aliens are real.

To those who say that NASA is just trying to hide evidence.

When in fact, finding an ancient Martian civilization would help them, because they can be granted more money to investigate the life forms.

So, if ther was an alien we would try to capture it the first chance we have.

A big reason that I think that you just believe in aliens is you are just trying to stick with the status quo.

There is no doubt in my mind that some part of you thinks that the "" Face on Mars "" was made by aliens comes from media, movies, books, radio talk shows, and etc.

One big thing that jumps out to me is Mars has never seen a human face before, so how could they have made it.

Another fact is that Earth have landforms just like this particular Martian landform.

Those landforms are butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.

So, as you can see that all the evidence here points to the "" Face on Mars "" being just another landform.

The technology we have today is the technology we need for driverless cars. Granted the cost of the technology is not affordable for everyday buys. ""The smart road systems work well"" said by google employers. They believe the upgrade need for the driverless car brings them a step closer to actually putting it on the market. Apparently , the cars needs new starters for it.

Google used the toyota Primus radar sensor, a GPS reciever and an inertial motion sensor to upgrade the starter. They use the combination of all these different materials

to impersonate a human driving the car.

The safety of the car is a big factor leading into the future. The google car has went more than half a million miles without a crash. I do not know too many people who drive now that have went that long without being in some kind of car crash. The safety is also more effecient because it alerts the driver to when they need to take over. The motion sensor

makes sure the driver hands never leave the wheel. These features are game changers to how people drive from here forward.

I believe the world will accept the change to driverless cars . I think the cars would hit the market and sell a trendmendous amount as soon as they release. The technology to these cars are nothing new like the sensors or the radios . They are just used in a different way than before to increase a car technology and safety of others. The cars would say some energy from the engine through the sensors.

My conclusion to the topic of driverless cars is they will eventually happen. the reasons I believe this are technology, safety and the world adapting to change.           ",3

If you look closely at the pictures took within the time period of 1976-2001 you can tell there has been a mistake because you look at the (Face on mars) and you think what!? is that true?. I do not think it is real because if you look at the pictures from 1976-2001 you can tell there has been a increase in technology such as photography. If you were to look at the pictures then you can easily tell its not a face because for one there is no face there anymore another reason is it looks like a mesa as one reporter said.

Do you ever feel like your on class but you still don't understand what your teacher is saying? Or maybe your too afriaid to say that your not comprehending the material in front of everyone. Maybe its the oppisite, you completely understand it and now class has left you bored. This is why the Facial Action Coding System would be very beneficial because it helps tell who is truthfull, it helps teacher grow, and it can help us communicate with one another.

Not only can this device also known as FACS decipher what emotion we are making. FACS also can tell if the emotion such as a smile from a student or a polotician is genuine. These all have to with the muscle movements within your face. As it says in paragraph 8 in the article there cplete different mucles being used when

a smaile is being forced. I suppose its true that it takes more muscles for frown then it does to smile.

FACS being able to tell whether students expressions are genuine can be very benedfical to both the student and the teacher. For example if the teacher was asking the calss if they had understood the lesson and the facial expressions seemed a bit worrysome then this would help the teacher be able to go back over that certian material a few times and help the student get the help they need. In

paragraph 6 it says ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional commuincation."" In this it works the same way if the student has become bred with the material.

There is alot of different things that we need to be able to understand in order to take full advantage of this technology. In order to do that we need to understand each other. Even though we communicate through many facials. FACS will help us move forward in that.

In conclusion this is why the Facial Action Coding System would be very beneficial because it helps tell who is truthfull, it helps teacher grow, and it can help us communicate with one another.                ",3

Imagine you are sitting in history class, and all of a sudden you start to fall asleep. You start to nod off because you are learning boring old history, when all of a sudden the lesson changes its tone to be more interesting. In return you do not fall asleep, and you learn plenty of new information. This technology is called Facial Action Coding System, and it should be used in the classroom. If this technology is used it will lead to less boredom, more engagment, and a general improvment in the school's atmosphere.

Firstly, this technology can be used to make school less boring. With this technology installed it would be able to detect when you are bored, and be able to change the lesson in order to make it less boring. This can lead to more learning being accomplished, because teachers would not have to spend time reteaching a subject. History is not boring, and if a computer could make history appealing to students then it should be practiced. People who oppose this technology may say that it is not advanced enough to detect human emotions. In rebuttle, ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" (D'Alto)

Secondly, this technology can be used to increase the student's engagement in the school. If a student is excited to learn new information, then they are engaged. If students are activily engaged with their learning they will do better in school. With students preforming better in school it could lead to an improvement in life, and to the advancement of the human race. American schools are also lagging behind thier counterparts, and this increase in engagment would benifit the American Educational System.

Thirdly, this technology can be used to improve the general environment of the school. Everybody goes through rough patches in their life, and sometimes students want to talk to administrators. Even if a student talks to an adult, they do not always tell the truth. With Facial Action Coding System they will be able to tell if you a telling the truth. For example ""Meanwhile, muscles called oribicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is streched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" (D'Alto) This would enable the teachers to know what is going on, and be able to help you best.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System should be used in the classroom. The technology would lead to less boredom in school, more engagment in school, and an improvment in the school's atmosphere. All of these factors would not only improve schools in America, but schools throughout the world. Our world is constantly becoming more based on technology, and the children of the world are our future. Should we not teach them in the best way possible? ",5

Do you remember the time you had that long never-ending day at work? And all you had on your mind was getting home. But you had about a 45 minute drive home. A task that seemed so impossible because you were so exhausted. Well why not have an automated car that asist you with your driving. Yes i´m talking about a self-driving car. Yes the mere future is right around the corner!

Google cofounder imagines a future with a public transportation system with these driverless cars. I agree with his booming vision. I think it would change the world in so many positive ways. The first thought that comes to mind is the economy. The car he wants to develop uses about half of the fuel today´s taxis use. That mean less fossil fuel use. Which leads to less polution in the air. I think if we cut the problem in half, that could be a stepping stone to end global warming.

But of course you know any big idea has down faults. The driverless arent´t totally driverless. When it comes complicated traffic or construction work on the roads, it needs the driver to take over. But the Google industries are finding safer ways and better ways the car can

be completely driverless. Did you know that Google has had driverless cars since 2009. I mean their cars have driven a whopping half a million miles without crashing?

One of the causes of deaths is car crahses.The self driverless cars will be also equipped with state of the art computer sytsems, antilock brakes, and with all that asistance it will also have you in the vehicle. The antilock brakes make ensure protection against rollovers, also it prevents out of control skids. They respond better than a human can do. So that mean less crashes. Which means less deaths. No one wants to lose there loved ones to a car crash.

The cars are all around just enjoyment you can sit back, relax, and actually enjoy the ride. I think the developement of the cars are such a good idea. Its going to help the economy, provide less crashes, and all in all let a car ride be enjoyable. The future is thought to be right around the corner.                ",4

In paragraph one of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" it says, ""He envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transportation taxi system. The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more felxibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world."" All these improvments in technology and cars could change the way we live.

There are some downsides to all this great technology, sadly. The passage states in paragraph two that ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigation through roadwork or accidents."" Also in paragraph seven it states, ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skils.""

These driverless cars do still need assistance in a few things to where you have to stay alert while driving but, besides that, this new technology will change the lives of many people. I am personally all for the driverless cars. The less I have to drive would make it much easier on me. I would love if within the next 10 or 20 years, we get it to where we don't have to do any assitance with the driverless cars and we could just sit back and enjoy the ride.

In conclusion, driverless cars and all this new technology impacts many people of all ages. Some people believe it's for the better and some believe it's not. It is a matter of opinion. But I believe that everyone would love to have these driverless cars. It saves on fuel, there would be less traffic accidents, and many other great improvments that could save the lives of others.

a13393c,"I think the Facial Coding System is valuable in a classroom. I think this because It can help out a lot. When a student doesn't want to explain thier emotions or don't know how to share emotions this system can be helpful and valuable. And I mean it is pretty cool that a facial system can calculate anyones emotions. And this FACS sounds totally unharmless.

In the article it explains how this system works. I will be wrtiting about how it works and get examples from the article. In the article it says that an action unit can calculate movement of one or more msucles and can detect the emotion. Dr. Paul, the creater of FACS states that he has calssified 6 different emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness all with the FACS. Examples of how the FACS can detect your emotion is in your face movements for example, as said in the story when your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrow when you are surprised; your orbicularis oris tightens your lips when you are angry. It is fantastic how this can know the emotion you are feeling.

I think FACS can actually be valuable in classrooms. A teacher can detect weither a student is happy,sad,angry, or surprised. It can be very useful for students that when they want to talk to thier teachers but don't know how to explain themelves this can help. FACS can help out in many more ways, useful ways. So my statement is this technology to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom is valuable and I also think students would enjoy trying it out.",2

In Source 1 the passage states that passaenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can benefit the enviorment.

Limiting car usage will lower the stress level of people when they are thinking about driving. Everyday people have to plan before they drive. Sometimes when people plan for driving they get stressed thinking about if theirs traffic or what if the road is closed. In Source 3 the passage states that rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. Furthermore, limiting car usage will limit the stress level of people thinking about driving.

Limiting car usage will decrease young people's amount of driving. In Source 4 the passage states that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license. Another study in Source 4 was found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. If their's less young people driving then there will be less accidents occuring. Overall, limiting car usage will keep young drivers from injurying themselves.

Either way limiting car usage will help our fellow citizens in general. This will reduce greenhouse gases. This will lower the stress level of people when they are thinking about driving. Also, limiting car usage will decrease the amount of young people driving. Futhermore limiting car usage will help us citizens.    ",4

The planet have diderent in speed mean that sometimes that we are closest to Mars nd ther times to Vensus. The issue explais that why is the planet touched down to Venus is more than three decades.

challenging is the clouds of highly corrosive suluric acid in Vensus atmoshere. Our planet suface is about over 800 degress Fahreheit, and the reason why because its our owen planet and its our conditions that we keep it clean, and theses condtions that are making these things that are more extreme than anything to humans encounter on Earth, such as an envionment would have to crush even a submarin accustomed to drving to the deepest parts of our planet.

71f005f,"There are many people that are for having driverless cars, but I am against it. I am against it for many reason. First reason is because it will make people lazy. Second reason is because a computer cannot think like a human brain. Last reason is because they are not safe.

My first reason I am against these cars are because they will make people lazy. America already has enough lazy people. So why will we waste money on sensors to make a car drive by itself when we can control it ourselfs. According to paragragh 7

""They can steer, accelerate, and brake by themselfs."" But paragraph 7 also say

""road ahead requires human skills such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" Which proves the only time you will actually have to drive is if you run into those situations.

Another reason I am against driverless cars ae because we can't trust technolgy to get us out of every situations. For example say you are riding and you car comes out to oncoming traffic and it wont stop. There will be nothing yuo can do to stop it. But if you can actually control the car than you wont have to worry about that because you know when to stop our car. Technology wise we are not ready for a driverless vechical.

My final reason I am against these cars are because the just arent safe. There are so many things that can happen while driving this car. For example a glitch can happen in the systemor you cars brakes stop working and you wont be able to stop and you could have nothing to do about it. In paragragh 6 it say a radar cost ""two hundred million dollars."" Why can't we use that money to make cars we can frive by ourselfs safer other than wasting money on a computer that can glitch out and stop working on us?

I am against driverless cars because they will make us lazier as a nation. They cannot think like a human brain. And finally because they just are not safe enough to be on the roads.",3
1ff3c5d,"So obviously by reading the title in this excerpt, you can infer that this whole passasge is about Venus. How close, conditions there, and other basic backround knowledge. Why would the author want to include this? Because this excerpt is about the possibility and dangers of exploring Venus up close and personal. The author, in this passage, provides good detail, and opinion, causing me to agree with said author that Venus should be explored.

Like I said in the intro he starts of by painting a picture in your mind about what scientists at NASA are dealing with here. First, he gives you some relatable information about it. That to the normal human looking up at the sky, it's just a very bright star that's actually a very close planet. Then he proceeds to provide on some technical facts about condidtions. He says, "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus...On the planet's surface, temperature average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.""

To persuade someone something this big, you have to give reasons for them to care. Good ones too. So the author did just that. He explains many reasons why a mission to Venus whether it be manned or unmanned should be sent to Venus. He claims that the reward outweighs the risk. Do keep in mind this is a planet at an of average 800 degrees Farenheit. Well he explains that the planet might've once been like our home. That a variety of creatures must've once called Venus home. There is convience in the fact that it is very close and space travel is very long and that it's surface has some barren natural structures and valleys similar to that of the Arizona and Nevada region.

He also gives ways or really one way to go about doing this. In the passage he reminds the reader that the surface temperature is an average 800 degrees. He also needs you to remember about the atmosphere containing acid-like forms melting metal in minutes. Basically, the surface is the no-no zone. So how do you do it? He mentions the idea of having an aircraft vehicle, sort of like a blimp to go ahead and stay up in the air avoiding the hellish conditions of the ground. There is still some risk but overall a lot safer. He also gives the idea of fully mechanical machines to calculate as it takes steel metal longer to melt. All the while making you confident in the idea of an mission to Venus with these ways or concepts in mind for the sake of science.

So in conclusion if the author's goal was to persuade me, he definitaly persuaded me. He provides evidence to convince you there is a way, he convinces you that there is something to be had in Venus, while also telling you to beware as it could go wrong in a lot of ways for us.

0302537,"I am for the development of driverless cars. I think it would be cool if we had cars that did the work for us. They are just like smart phones in a way. However I don't think we should completely have no control over the car. People may start thinking that they can do whatever while the driving is in progress. That is not the case. Drivers should still pay attention to the road as if they were normally driving. Driverless cars will benefit us in a positive way.

One reason why i am for driverless cars is for the disabled people who can't drive like others can. Those people deserve a way to get around town too. Another reason why i think having driverless cars is a good idea is because of the simple fact that it is an option. People can buy a driverless car but still take over if they want to or need too. Another good reason for having driverless cars is for long distance drives. Sometimes flying a plane to a far destination is too expensive but if a car could take people long distance to where they need to go without themselves having to drive such a long way it would be more easier for themselves. The only concern with driverless car would be ""Who is at fault"" but that could be easily depicted i'm sure.

Driverless cars would benefit us greatly. It shows no harm to anybody who would like to have no driver. For all the reasons previously stated it is a good idea to have driverless cars. After all, it is our decision to make whether or not we want to have driverless cars. ",3
5280733,"Does we are really voting for the elector or someobody else?, sometimes elections can be unfair but one of the best methos and the one more easily to understand and fair is by electing the president by popular vote.

To beging with,every state should be treatly the same, have the respect campaings and no one state should have advantage or disadvante at the time of voting because sometimes representatives can give a advantage or a disadvantage and sometimes can give a catasrophic decision, but also more power for bigger sates that represents 35 million voters like california.""given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people"".

other example of this can be seen in te elections of 2000,""seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including rhole island and south california,and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. And this just show how when we have electoral collegue can be a disadvantage for candidates, if they know they are not going to win they don't focus on those states,and some people who want to have more options or listen to other persons they cant because they dont see a campaign to convice them.

In summary,its better to the winner to take all cause almost half of the population agrred with the candidate thinking and maturity to select whats best to others,but also whe you are voting fot the state elector you cant control their final vote and sometimes you don't choose who you is your state elector and you don't now if he has the best wisenes to decide,if two presidents in popupal vote get close that mean that  a lot of people agreed with the same person,but that doesnt happen when we have electoral because its just a minimum number and we dont now if everybody in the state really agreed with the representator.

To summarize,if we want a fair election and be part of it, listen to others options, have part of the the decision of our president , and be trheated the same and the our vote really counts we should elect by popular vote.            ",3
9d85ae6,"Dirverless cars can be good or bad, safe or reckless, and smart or dumb. Either way our technology is advancing and it may be adavncing too quickly. A good thing about the car is that its easier for disabled people and a bad thing is technology isnt always reliable. The cars could cause less accidents or cause even more. The cars could be the smartest thing the world could have or it could be the dumbest.

The thing about driverless cars is that we are not learning control and once again the world is getting even more lazy. Most of the time no one will be paying attention with them not having to drive. They will be too distracted listening to the radio, sleeping, talking on the phone, talking to passengers, or texting. Also if the person would need to take over they wouldnt be able too because they wouldnt know when to take over, because of the distraction.

16 year olds wont be able to drive normally, because they will never learn because of the driverless cars. The teenagers would just sit in the car just like a passenger and not drive. The teens would be so distracted with all their social media and texting they would have time to react if something went wrong. If the teenager needed to take over they would know what to do because they didnt learn how to drive right.

Although this is a rather good thing for disabled people. If they have an amputated leg or leg and actually any disability that would still allow them to drive it would be easiar on them, because they may not be able to drive 100 percent of the time. They would be less stressed out on people yelling at them for being too slow and fighing and conflicting with them.

Disabled people already can drive, you can get a prostedic leg and still be able to drive. If they cant drive 100 percent of the time they should be driving anyway. That is a huge hazard on the road. It could lead to many accidents and multiple injuries or even death.

Driverless cars will come whether we like them or not. I personally do not want the driverless cars, but I would have to deal with it and embrace it. I still think there needs to be a long time inbetween now and when they do come out so it gives our people and technology time to embrace it and get used to the Driverless Cars.",4
66ee32a,"There are many advantages today of limiting car usage. This accounts for car usage limits in Europe, United States, and many other places. Limiting car usage around the world isn't just good for society, but also for yourself. Limiting car usage helps to separate suburban life from over usage of autos. It's good for people to separate themselves from cars also because many people get stressed about their gas money, whether or not they will be late for something, and also because many people worry about their own driving, and may think they will injur somebody.

Reasons why limiting car usage has been discussed throughout many people and regions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. There has been efforts in the past two decades to make cities more suitable for walking but it's basic percepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation. From the passage, David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, says, ""All of our development since Wold War Two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" Mr. Goldberg describes how everything pertaining to where places are built, how many roads built, and not enough sidewalks is because of the car being the center of everything, that people are not focusing on anything else.

Advantages of limiting car usage varies on different places. Some of these advantages include the ban of driving in Paris to help clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five days of intensifying smug. In Bogota, Columbia the streets of this capital city, eerily devoid of traffic jams. Banning cars also cause less accidents around the world. Not using a car for one whole day limits stress on people and greatly lowers air pollution. Limiting the usage of cars in Bogota has also helped the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city.

Limiting car usage in many places even for one day has put a good effect on society, people, and the world. Limiting car usage in Germany suburbs opens the streets for tourists on trolly's or just people who need to be to work on a certain time who cannot afford cars. It also reduces the air pollution by very much. From the passage Heidrun Walter said, ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Opening the streets from cars allows isolation between suburban life and auto use. Greenhouse gas emissions will decrease by decline of car use which is good for the planet. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals due to their high usage of diesal gas. Causing the decline of car usage will remove smog due to not as much diesal going into the air. In Bogota the Day Without Cars is held to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The turnout was large, despite the gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota, Antanas Mockus, said, ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" He also stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.

In conclusion there's many ways to reduce air pollution. There's also many advantages to banning usage of cars. Not only are people stress free and feeling good, but air-pollution decreases and Greenhouse gas emissions stop.     ",4
8c46e3b,"Dear state senator,

I think that they should change the election way of how they are doing it. I think that the president should be chosen by the most popular vote. i aslo think that they shouldnt do the voting thing if they are gunna end up chooseing it them selfes. in the passage it said that, the electoral college is made up of 538 electors and only the majority vote is 270. So i dont understand why they thousand of people to vote if their vote doesnt really mater its what senators choose overall. i think it would be fair if what the peple choose the most shall win. What if one of them gets more votes and the senator picks the other because they had more votes in there group, thats not fair. i just think that the overall vote of the people should count, and not make them wast there time. it also says in the article when you vote for you candidate you actuall voting for the candidates elector, so they are trying to trick them into thinking that there votw would count. what if the persident that the senator choose didnt know how to work stuff and had bad disitions, the election is every four years on a tuesday on a november. thats a pretty long time if you ask me. I think that half of the people votes dont cont cause of the sentors that choose. i know it would be long to count everones vote but i dont think it matters because in the end it would be chosen by the people that wanted that president not what the senators wanted.

1917eb2,"Venus is often called the ""Evening Star"" for being the brighest points of light. It's also the second planet close to the sun. And as it's simple to see from distant, it proved a very challenging place for examining closely.

It's very worthy even though Venus's thick atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide. But getting through the clouds are worse with them being sulfuric acid as a high danger sign for spaceships to only be there for a few hours. The temperature has scortching heat of 800 degrees fahrenheit and 90 times more pressure than our planet. Venus has impediments of erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes to anything landing on it's surface. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may once of been like Earth with oceans and various forms of life.

The Astronomers think it's a good idea to kepp trying to land on Venus even though their spaceships never last more than a few hours and believe there might be various life forms like Earth and some oceans. But Venus is to deadly with acid, scortching heat, and 90 times our pressure that could crush a submarine. Also Venus has some lighting that strikes anything landing on it's surface and erupting volcanoes with frequent earthquakes. Venus also has a surface of rocky sediments with valley's, mountains, and craters under the clouds and atmosphere.

People have tried sending multiple spaceships to Venus but they never came back. It was the brightest ""Evening Star"" but the most dangerous planet with sulfuric acid atmosphere. Astronomers know the dangers of going to Venus but want think theres life form and oceans like Earth. If anything was to land on it's surface, lightning would strike it and the spacecraft could only last a few hours if lucky. My conclusion to this is that Venus is a dangerous place but I would like to see whats on that planet, and know if there really is any life form or oceans. If so the astronomers might take some life from there adn water to bring and test what it actually is. But they can't send people into acid atmospheres and scortching heat just to land on Venus.",2

Studying Venus is worthy. In the article, the author mentioned how hard and how long people have been trying to reach Venus. The author explained that people have sent the numerous spacecrafts to Venus but spacecraft could not survived the landing more that few hours. ""human have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more that a few hours.""

d168476,"My fellow citizens, there are many reasons why we all should depend less on our cars as a way to travel or to get to one place to anouther. One of the many reasons is that there are some neighborhoods that are doing it so that their families can not drive a car and if they do they have to pay money, and there are already many places that are doing car free days or somethimg like that.

According to Elisabeth Rosenthal there is a city in germany named VAUNBAN were they can not use cars and if they do use cars then they would have to park it in a place that is very far away and they would have to pay a total of $40,000 to buy that parking space this is better because there are many ways that polution can polute the earth and we do not want that to happen.

Also there are many places that are doing car free days in which the citizens must not use there cars and ride the busses to work so that there izs less polution. this is good because there will be a major decrease in polution which is good for the earth and also good for the soul.

In conclusion i think that there should be less places for cars to drive and polute the world and mother earth and you should to.    ",3
bb0c484,"Vroom, vroom goes the 1998 Chevy Impala next to you at the stop light. Driving has become apart of culture that is standard to the developed world. But the culture is slowly changing because the driving epidemic is becoming limited. Cars can be very expensive, harmful to the environment, and troublesome. Limiting car usage can help the environment, help finances, and reduce stress.

Cars are defined as metal cases with lether seats powered by gas or diseal. Gas and disel are fuels that are harmful to the Earth and can cause harmful emission and greenhouse gases. These gasses can cause smog, or smoke and fog mixed together creating a grey cloud of unbreathable dense air. Smog is very harmful for the environment and can heat the Earth which is not the ideal for the human body. In France, smog, caused by car emissions became unbearable, thus causing the entire city of Paris to ban cars for five days. According to Robert Duffer, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog"" (Paris Bans Driving due to Smog Paragraph 14). Therefore cars and its horrible blow can cause a blanket of harmful reactant. Cars can also cause greenhouse gases which is when the heat of the day and the cool of the night trap in the harmful emissions of a car. These greenhouse gases can also heat the Earth and can harm humans. Elisabeth Rosenthal states, ""Passenger cars are responible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Euorpe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Car-Free Cities Paragraph 5). In effort to save the Earth and the human race many cities and communties have adotped car-banning, reducing the amount of population caused buy cars.

A 2014 Lincoln MKX runs about $45,000, which is the equvialent to the salary of a high school teacher annually. Cars can be very expensive to buy, maintain, and to fuel. The price of oil is about $2.45 today. But over the past few years gas prices have fulcutated up to almost $4.00 a gallon. The average driver might buy gas every two weeks at 20 gallons, that equals $116 a month for gas. The money used to fuel the car has turned into a gas bill, not to mention the sparatic mishaps that can happen while on the road. Cars today have become an invesment instead of a luxury. Although, ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions,"" does not mean it should remain. The advance in technology and resources has allowed people to reduce the use of cars, and ultimately save themselves money. For example, many people have co-workers that live near one another. Thus, both persons can carpool on alternate days. Mimi Sheller suggests, ""the Internet makes telecommunting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends (End of Car Culture Paragraph 35). It is much easier and cheaper to carpool, take the bus, or take the subway. Limiting car usage would save money because more young people are ""interested[in driving], but it's not a prority."" Therefore, parents do not have to spend $30,000 on a new car for their 16 year old. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009,"" which is putting money back into the pockets of parents and public transportation companies (The End of Car Culture Paragraph 39).

Road rage is the disease the that overtakes a person when another person is driving idiotically. Road rage is sitting at a green light at a complete stop because the person in front of you is too busy texting their BFF. Road rage is caused by driving. Driving can cause stress because cars are out of your control, traffic is out of your control, and time is out your control. When things are out of control, human nature is to panic. Driving is not the time nor the place to panic. Limiting car usage can reduce the effects of this stress caused by driving because there would be less people on the road, less traffic, and less crashes. Heidrun Walter says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Car Free Cities Paragraph 3). Less cars means less drivers which then means a safer environment for pedestrians. Less cars means less traffic which means no more road rage. Less cars means less cars because there are less reckless drivers grazing the road. Limiting car usage can also make people come closer together because it forces them to interact in order to get around. For instance, instead of hopping into you 2013 Camry you call an old friend who happens to work on a different floor of your office building. This interaction can spark a new realtionship and brightens your day. Cars and driving causes stress because it is out of control, but if cars are limited then the stressed caused by driving will be reduced.

Road rage, smog, and tickets, driving is the mush pot of the many problems of this world. Limiting car usage can save the planet, save money, and save you blood from boiling. The priviledge of driving has been taken advantage of and has caused the world to decay at its own expense. The human race has the ability remit from the tragdey of cars one city at a time.         ",5
b3c1886,"To whom it may concern,

In my own opinion I think we should keep the electoral college because of the specific fact that it has to make candidates strategize on which states to heavily campaign in. Some candidates don't even go to some states. Like in ""2000, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina"" (Source 3 paragraph 13). With that being said, most candidates will try to get as many swing states as they can with a few large states, (California or Texas), ""Voters in {

swing

} states are most likely to pay closer attention to the campaign-to really listen to the competing candidates..."" (Source 3 paragraph 20). That is good because if they are paying closer attention to the campaign, then candidates will make sure that the views that impact those states more are adressed heavily. ""Democrats in texas and Repulicans in California might vote the for the other side because of the fact that their is vote will ahve no effect"" (Source 3 paragraph 23). That would be assuming that in the up coming election a Republican candidate pops up and surprises evryone in California and all of a sudden 55 more electoral votes to the Republican party. ""Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO all agreed on abolishing the Electoral College"" (Source 2 paragraph 1). They all said and agreed on it, but the one thing about it that's so great about the electoral college is that it also has the voters watch and think about who they vote for. If they had gotten rid of the electoral college, then voters wouldn't take their time and they would vote for whoever had the popular vote in their state. If that were to happen then the whole election would be based of of what the candidate looks like and not what he's saying. ""Back in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy"" (Source 2 paragraph 11). To me that just seems like a waste of time trying to get new electors and replacing the ones that were against one candidate all because of a standing on the political spectrum, doesn't that seem a little to much. Most people might also think that every state has a ""winner take all system"", but Nebraska and Maine both have a variation of proportional representation (Source 1 Paragraph 7). That is something that voters should know about because it shows that their state is doing what it can to make sure it isn't all 1 sided.

As I conclude this letter, strategize before you campaign and you could be the next president.

Sincerely,

John Owens                    ",3
e18839b,"You walk in to class one day and find out that your teacher or whom ever actually knows how you feel . Would it be strange, ackward or understandable? This latest innovation called Facial Action Coding System from Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe is a software that can recognize human emotion. Human emotion is communicated non-verbally which can be interpreted by muscualr units.

Your sitting in a lecture confused but decide not to say anything but do not realize that your teacher knows how you feel because of this software. This software may help with a lot in a classroom from depression to confusion and even excitment .

Prof . Huang predicts "" A classroom computer could recognize when a sudent is becoming confused or bored"" ( D'Alto, 6). This software may be the best innovation for schools now that many counselors can only get so little of information from students.

As many will argue that this software may not be getting the right information but it has been tested and put to work by Phsychologist , such as Dr. Paul Eckman. ""He has been able to classify six basic emotions-- Hapiness, suprise,anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" (D,Alto, 3). This just comes to state that this software is able to process human emotion by facial muscles and therefore it comes to tell your emotion by how you portray.

This just comes to conclusion that maybe this software can actually help schools improve on helping students in any circumstance. As teachers, there jobs are to make sure students are not confused but better yet understand the concept that was teached. I believe this software may do a lot and should be tested in schools.",3
2c11555,"Luke Bomberger became a Seagoing Cowboy he helps people whose lives had been affected by World War ll. Luke became a Seagoing

Cowboy because he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime, as he says in paragraph one. Luke also wanted to help others who had been affected by World War ll.

Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice, to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and much more as it says in paragraph two. Even though it was a long journey across the oceans and the waters were rough Luke loved being a Seagoing Cowboy and he loved to help the people.

Some people would probably refuse to go to another country that had just been through war some people would say it was to risky and unsafe well it is, some people might say that it is too dangerous to cross the ocean well it is but Luke felt that these were things that he needed to do and is something that is important to him.

Luke also got to visit many great places in between his journeys, he got to see many different places such as the Panama Canal on his way to China in paragraph five Luke says that ""seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special"" and ""so was taking a gondola ride in Venice , Italy a city with streets of water. Luke thought that it was all so great.

But some people might say that they wouldnt go there because once again it's just too dangerous or that if they wanted to go there then they definetly not go on a boat and they would much more want to fly there. Well once again that is their opinion and Luke was happy the way that he went and was happy that he could see it and that he go to experience the jouney.

In conclusion Luke loves being a Seagoing Cowboy he loves all the sights, all the help that he can give to these other people, and that he could have this opportunity in life.                  ",3
b9657e2,"The author states in paragraph one, ""While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."" This is stating that Venus is safe, but you need to know challenges come along with it. In paragraph eight it says, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value."" the author values the challenge and strives for the goal.

Although the author may enjoy studying Venus and it's challenges, this study comes with it's difficulties. The author states in paragraph six, ""Or maybe we should think of them as challenges.""reffering to how they, ""cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" The challenges they face predict how worthy of a pursuit Venus really is. The author states in paragraph five, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" this meaning that this would be a risk, but they will survive.

The author states in paragraph eight, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts."" this is saying what we do or where we travel should not be limited by dangers and fear. If we let dangers and fear overcome us, will we ever get anything accomplished? We let danger and fear go, and let the power of adventure come through. ",2
7a738ab,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the authors support to his knowledge of Venus is very informative. In the article the author provides information about the planet to inform the reader that even though it may be hard and risky that it'd be outstanding to be able to put humans on the planet, but because of it's ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide"" or blazin temperatures no space craft or human are able to last on the planet without getting crushed or burned to crisps. Venus atmosperic pressure is 90 times greater than what us humans and living things experience on earth making it impossible for someone to last on the planet, with all of its cons many would rather admire from a view but some would rather get closer.

The evidence from the article that would make you want to avoid venus as much as it may seem nice and plesent the information provided would make you not want to put a foot on the ground of Venus. In the article it states that the planets weather consists of ""erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning stikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface"" not hospitable for any space craft nor human life.

Astronomers believe venus to have been ""covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" According the the knowledge of the article ""the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" stateting that Venus and Earth are and where once similar at a point in time. NASA believed to be coming up with multiple ways for humans to set foot on the planet without any complications, at the moment NASA's only way of getting near the planet with stable temperatures and pressure is by having a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.""

In conclusion the author puts into words that visiting Venus by foot seems impossible but by the rate of the technology and people willing to help with making it happen setting foot on Venus will be sooner than many believe. In the future humans will finally reach the land of Venus but in the mean time many more features about the planet are yet to be seen and uncovered. The space craft can only provide so much information from a distance that with better technology a space craft may be able to get closer to the planet for more indetailed information. As far as that is it's closer than you'd think and the author's information and details of the planet in the article are very ear listening for any reader looking for information of the planet.",3

It is a good reason because they can discover the expresion of the paints like Mona Lisa but the same time for the fake people who just are being fake.

And it could be able to use for the president to see if they smile its natural or fake. To the special people if they are being honest because that can be seen by they face expresions that's what I read.

However the bad reason is that they could use it to all the people and know that they are not feeling good or that type of stuf that is private in that way. But also they can had the or ask the permission for the people so if they can see their expresions because it is private for what are your feeling inside.

In conclusion it is good and bad. Becuase we can discover from famous paints or photos that had expresions. But for the present it would be something that is private and cannot violate by they rights.

d9fce09,"In recent years car ownership has decreased with positive consequences. Life with out cars has its advantages. It is reducing the amount of emissions put into the air, cars are resposible for 12 percent of green house gas. Life without cars can also relive stress.

An experimental car free community in Germany called ""Vauban"" completed in 2006 is a town where 70% of its residents do not own cars and the streets are completely car free. It's constructed so everything is within walking distance. This means no need for cars, wich means little to no polution. People usaully bike or walk to their destination in Vauban.""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much better this way"" says a Vauban resident. Vauban is a component of a movment called smart planning. As you can see, a community with no cars is prospering aurgurably better than one with cars. People are less stressed and pollution is heavily reduced. A life/community with no cars has little to no negative results.

""After a near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air oof the global city."" france need a solution to reduce the smog, so they banned even-numberd license plates on monday and odd on tuesday. with some exceptions such as electric cars and hybrids. After five days of heavy smog and no cars, smog congestion was reduced to 60 percent. Here is another perfect example how decreasing cars on the street is directly linked to pollution decrease .because they took away cars, pollution was heavily decreased. This is a huge advantage that  limiting car usage has.

The USA has always been a car culture, but things are changing for the better.

car liscense ownership rates have only decreased since 2005. this means we are putting out less emissions than 12 years ago! we are eqaul to where the country was in 1995. the reasons vary as to why lisence ownsership is decreasing but so far it has its advantages. People are car pooling more and using bikes and walking to their destination. the only negative side of limited car usauge is for the car industry. with less cars on the road, they get less money. But overall people will benifit from this.

Limiting car usage has huge advantages and I encourage you to try walking or biking rather than using your car. You will become more socail, fit, and help prevent pollution.    ",3
9207534,"Imagine yourself in a driverless convertible. You think you have no worries and everything is perfect. The wind is running through your hair and you reach down to grab a pair of sunglasses. Then all of a sudden your in a nasty road rage of cars and you crash. But how? Driverless cars are supposed to be safe. In reality, so many things can go wrong and malfunction. Who would be responsible in paying the hospital bills and car charges? The makers of the cars or the person in the drivers seat?

Not only can we not trust the cars but we can not trust us humans. As said in paragraph 8, ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive? ""

Everybody is different and will react differently or not react at all to the signals letting us know when it is our turn to drive. What happens if we get so bored we fall asleep and wakeup in a crash? Even if there are rules and regulations to the driverless cars we are all not guarenteed to follow them. Until there is more signals that will help every indivudual , no one should be driving driverless cars.

What happens if a car malfunctions? You can not always trust the makers of the cars. Malfunctions and recalls can be rare but happen often. Cars are not always coded properly. What happens if the engineering code messes up and drives you somwhere else or into a ditch? There should be more saftey precautions other then the airbags and seat belts .These things are always bound to happen so we should always be prepared when it comes to new inventions.

Who is responsible in paying for the damage that happens? As said in paragraph 9, "" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--- the driver or the manufacturer?

If the companies thought smarter they would know it is not a good idea to have driverless cars. Not only are you saving time but you are saving money. There would be so many court cases on who is paying for hospital funds and that would cost a lot of many for the companies, that some may not be able to afford.

Overall, there should not be any driverless cars and they should make it illegal in all states. Driverless cars are not safe, due to malfuctions , and the irrespossibility of us careless humans. Unless there is more testing and helpful signals to keep all individuals safe there should be no driverless cars.",4

Even if we somehow manage to make a spacesuit that isn't going to melt or fry a person on Venus, then we can explore it. Tech these days is our down fall, we create tech thatwe use everyday, but with all the space exploration that is our go to, because we don't have the tech now to send a person from one side of the galaxy to the other. Once we do that then we can explore. Venus maybe closer to us, but there is no water present on the surface therefor no life could be living on that planet. To study Venus we would have to send someone there to collect samples, at which they have about 80% chance of death right at the moment, and a 20% chance of living.

He also talks about why scientists are still curious about Venus and why Venus's history can be important geographically.

Long ago Venus was very earth like. Venus had a surface of rocky sediment and included familiar features like valleys and mountains. The planet was also largely covered with oceans. in hopes of venus returning like its older self, scientists are looking into a way to explore the planet, but with its challenging conditions scientists are looking into more options rather than sending humans which could be disasterous and wouldnt be very safe in those unimaginable conditions. The author goes in depth as to way scientists are trying to find an alternative to sending humans. With ther conditions of Venus its dificult for scientists to find a sollution. Althougth these obstacle, the author pushes the idea to continue the research on venus.

7df2dbf,"In the article “Driverless Cars Are Coming,” the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. In my opinion there are more negative aspects than positive ones. So i believe these cars are a bad idea.

I believe this way for multiple reasons. For starters they arent even fully driverless. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.."" So whats the point in buying a driverless car when you are still the one driving it? There isnt one so why bother. Also they're not 100% safe to all pedestrians and others so in some states they're not even legal. ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. "". Do you really want something that can put others in danger? I would surely hope not.

Im sure others would argue that the cars are safe,better on gas, etc.. but there are to many downfalls to put these cars on the road. This is why in my opinion these cars are a negative aspect to the world, and should not be on the roads.",2
5119498,"The ""face"" on mars was not made my aliens. We know this because it is only a Martian mesa, those are common on Cydonia. The only difference is that this one had shadows that made it look like a egyption Pharaoh. Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, most of them thought otherwise. Photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyo. "" we felt it was important to taxpayers,"" says Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASAs Mars Exploration Program.

So we photographed the face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. On April 5, 1998 the first time that the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, Michael and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the Viking did. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first went on the web. Saddly enough it revealed that it was a natural landform. People were sad to see that it was not a alien moument after all, but some people still thought that it was still an alien moument.

d6cbb21,"INTRODUCTION: A brand new software has been developed. This software improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others; This new software has promising applications for a variety of industries.

Imagine a computer can tell how you're feeling just from your face, like for example you go to a computer and ask her how am I feeling today, then the computer will say= 83%happy, 9%disgusted, 6%fearful, 2%angry; And you'll be like WHAT?, how can a simple computer make such a thing?.

The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face, with 44 major muscles this is called ""action unit"".

Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System)

BODY: Dr. Huang observes that the facial expressions for each emotion are universal and humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" every day; How?: you can probably tell how is your friend feeling just looking at him or hearing his voice.

This software could change the whole world; For example imagine you are in the ethernet and then a web ad player pop's up, if you smile at it a similar ad might follow; But if you frown, the next ad will be different.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huang predicts.

CONCLUSION: Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also can help produce them; we unconsciously imitate person's facial expressions. So in conclusion I would say that we can start using this magnificient software and his technology to read student's emotional expressions because it could also help teacher's to see how their student's are doing and if someone is distracted or bored the computer will notice the teacher so he/she can move on into another thing or go talk with the student.

d5bc512,"F.A.C.S would be a valuable reasourse to read the emotions of students in a classroom, but over all useless and waste of resources. The abillity to read the emotions of a student and change the style of teaching is interesting, but if somthing is changed other students may find it boreing. Every student has different emotions and you cannot change the lesson to fit that one student is is bored, because another student may become bored with the change. The variation of emotion in students is uncontrolled and how someone feels can change in seconds. F.A.C.S is interesting, but not needed in school and classrooms.

Many students don't care about school and will ingnore the change in the lesson like Dr. Huang is talking about. The article also never states how the class would be monitored. Its also never stated how long the scan will take, the scan of emotion could take up class time if the scan needed to be infront of a computer. Its also a school where you learn, not a safeplace where when you feel sad the teach knows and tries to cheer you up. Teachers don't need to know student emotions and shouldn't care they are there to teach.

F.A.C.S is interesting with the way it forms 3D models of a face to identify emotions. The way F.A.C.S can put your emotions into percents in extrordinary and very amazing. The use for it in classrooms is unneeded on the other hand. The change in emotions in students is to frequent for the system to help the teacher change teaching methods in the middle of class. Some people just don't like school and wouldn't care what changes the system may help suggest. There are too many factors for F.A.C.S to run smoothly and be a help. Classrooms do not need F.A.C.S.

1c0c7cd,"Venus is the closest thing to Earth in our solar system scientists claim. We can't even explore it though because of many factors. It would be great to explore Venus and see if any life forms once had inhabitted it. There would be many advantages with having another planet.

Venus being able to support humans would be a great thing for the world. The air pollution in the world right now is very high. Once our ozone breaks away completly we will fly to Venus and pretty much start over. It might be a crazy idea but it could work. The ozone on Earth won't last forever. We just have to figure out a way to safely inhabit Venus.

Venus has many problems when it comes to conditions to live there. The atmosphere is made of mostly corrosive sulfuric acid. The temperatures on Venus' surface is also around 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The pressure alone on Venus is 90 times greater than Earth, that's enough pressure to crush a submarine. Scientists will have to brainstorm some amazing ideas to try and inhabit Venus.

Scientists can barely even learn anything about Venus with our technology to date. Even if we take a blimp 30 miles above Venus to try and do research, it will still be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Also you won't be able to see the ground do to the atmosphere, it's so dense it doesn't let in any light. Scientists will try and resort to older technology to maybe get some data from Venus. They will use mechanical machines instead of machines containg computers. This may lead to the machine lasting long enough on Venus for scientists to gain enough data to try and send a human there.

Scientists have a heavy task ahead of them if they want to inhabit Venus. There are many factors that make exploration of Venus difficult, hopefully scientists can figure out ways to get around them. We will just have to wait and see what the future holds for the exploration of Venus. ",3
b5ede70,"Limiting car usage is a good idea. Limiting cars usage it a wonderful idea for many reasons. most people have the ability to live there life without cars, this would help cut back on pollution, and for most people it would be cheaper. Although some people may see this as a impossible way of living some of us do not.

To begin, people can live without cars people have done it before us and eventually people will do it after us. As shown in source 1 these people in Vauban, Germany have given up a life of cars for a simpler much quiter life in the suburbs. Life in this city has been condensed down into a one square mile area where people are able to go on with there everyday lives without having to get into a car to go somewhere. Life in this city is does not go completely without cars if these people need to leave the city they can simply walk to their very own parking space in the parking garage right on the outskirts of the city. these people have the ability to keep there cars but they have to buy a parking space when they buy there house you also generally wouldnt need your car unless you were going on a long drive that required you to leave the city. There is also the fact that there will be a day soon when we run oout of fossil fuels and what is a fossil fuel? gas. there will soon enough be a day where we dont have any gas and we will not be able to drive cars everywhere that we want.

Next, this would be one of the most effective ways to cut back on pollution. as shown in the 2nd source paris was struggling with a very bad polution problem that they needed to deal with. Paris was having the same sort of problem that beijing, china is having and beijing is the most poluted city in the world. so they banned all the cars that ended in a even number on monday and a odd number on tuesday. Just doing this for one day cut the amount of pollution in half. Imagine our worldwide polllution levels if driving was limited. The second largest form of pollution is cars so limmiting driving could even drop cars a few ranks back. Every part of getting to fossil fuels that fuel our cars is more and more pollution. gas is a very large pollutant and it causes alot of problems for our nation and one day there will be no more gas.

Furthermore, limiting driving would almost be cheaper for the people as talked about in source 4 less and less people have been getting there liscenses and driving cars because it isnt needed as much anymore. there are more ways of public transit that people are taking advantage of such as the mans son who takes the Bay Area Rapid Transit instead of driving his car. some might say that taking these other forms of transportation might take longer and yes they might be right but they are also much cheeper instead of having to pay a large amount of money to first, buy a car and then, buy gas. which the gas prices only seem to be going up lately. They have the ability to buy cheep tickets for the ride on the train or maybe a bus. As i spoke about earlier we will one day run out of fossil fuels. Gas is a fossil fuel and leading up to the time where we wont have gas anymore the gas will just keep getting more and more expensive because the less gas we have in our community the more that it will cost. also the more that people will want it one day most of us will not have the money to drive cars not because of the cost of the car but because of the cost of the gas.

Coming to a end, there are many other ways to travel other than buy a vehichle and some may be easier for you cheeper for you or better for the environment so why keep on hurting the environment when you could simply make the world a better place by just not driving a car. there are many reasons to limit driving but we could easily do it because people can live without cars, it would help the environment and cut back on pollution, it would also be much cheeper.

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author talks about the challanges that NASA faces when trying to visit Venus.

Trying to visit Venus is a very hard task for NASA because Venus has a lot of things different about it than Earth. Venus is one of our closes reletives is size. But has a thick atmosphere and it is made of 97% carbon dioxide blankets and clouds that are made of sulfuric acid. Venuses planet surface is around 800 degrees fahrenheit. The author talks about these to show how dangerous it is and what challenges NASA faces to explore this plant. But to really understand Venus NASA needs to get up close with this plant. So they have sent un-maned devices to explore but dont last more than a few hours. But NASA is looking back at simplified devices that are made of silicon carbide that can last up to 3 weeks in the harsh conditions of Venus. Which means we are getting closer to undertanding this amazing plant. NASA whats to send a blimp-like vehicle to surface the plant and use the drone to explore and collect samples. So the author did a great job telliing us about the plan and it seems that despite the dangers it can be accomplished with hard work and preparing for the dangerous mission of exploring Venus.

In the story ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author did a great job teilling me why this is well worth the dangers and expolring this amazing planet. ",3
1c652c1,"The electoral college is a bad thing for the United States of America and should be taken down because the electoral college is done by electors instead of the people of America. This is a bad thing because basically the popular vote done by the citizens of America don't count for anything if the loser wins the electoral votes. In the year 2000 Al Gore won the popular vote against George Bush but even though the people wanted him to be the next president Bush won the electoral votes and became U.S. president instead of Gore.

Bradford Plumer wrote that, ""Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Represinitives, where state delegations vote on the president (The Sentate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state cast only one vote Wyoming, represinting 500,000 voters would have as much say as the 55 reprisinatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.  Given that that many voters vote one part for the president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election;  in 1976, a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing votes away from catastrophe.

A counterclaim for the argument made by Bradford Plumer would by written by Richard A. Posner. Posner says, ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selectiong the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state -Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing that their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by the popular vote.... But of course no voter's vote swings the national election and in spite of that, about one-half of the eligible American population did vote in 2012's election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people think that a single vote may decide an election....""

Also in paragraph 7 it was said that none of the cars developed so far are completly driverless and humans need to stay alert to take over the wheel. Finally in paragraph 9 it asks who would be responsible if technology fails. I'm against driverless cars.

Humans need to know how to drive a car for simple actions. In paragraph 2 it says divers sometimes need to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as roadwork or accidents.

Stated in paragraph 7 none of the cars developed so far are completly driverless and humans need to stay alert. Human need to know how to drive a car incase technology fails or an emergency. If a human doesn't know how to drive a car and relies on the car and you're in a dangerous situation, then the driver and passengers are most likely to be killed. A human needs to know how to navigate through work zones and around accidents. The Google Car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.

Safety is the number one most important thing when being in a car. It's the drivers job to make sure everyone in the car and themself is safe. If someone is injured or technology fails, who is at fault- the driver or the manufactuer? Trafiic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.

I'm against driverless cars because Google cars aren't truly driverless, humans need to stay alert to take over the wheel, and who would be responsible if technology fails.           ",2
47288ad,"being aale to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.

I believe if a student is struggling then they will find the most productive way out of how they are struggling, doing anything to gain some sort of happiness when they are down. it is there business and privacy, I never think that should be put into jeproady. It is impossible to detect 100% how someone is feeling, and I don't think that some new technology is going to change that. Nothing can detect how someone is emotionally feeling, facial expressions don't show emotions. Anyone can fake a smile and that thing be thrown off. Nothing can be said with a ""calculation"" I don't believe that a computer can tell how I feel based upon the looks of my smile, We have all taken a picture with someone we may not want to, but we toughed the smile out in that, this will be no different. Although, facial expressions are univeral based upon the emotion, people can manipulate the system and they will. The whole thing seems very orgainzed, like when the articel states that quote ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. That is truly breathtaking, and almost too good to be true.

but I just think students will rebel when they have something can show how they feel, becasue that computer cannot get into the minds of some people, and truly help them, when someone who is visibly there, and physically there can help them out so much more. Some students will love this feature if it ever gets adapted, but most will rebel, and dislike school even more than some of them already do.

Emotional expressions are how someone feels, and thinks about anything, a computer will never be able to tell me how to feel or think, and some corny ad for a youtube video will not change me if something truly drastic is affecting me, I think that the entire production of the FACS is magnificent, and truly admirable.

I just think in this date and age that you cannot influence someone on how they think, or how they feel. If someone is happy, you should continue to let them go with the flow, and do there own thing, not crowd them with a computer that could potentially know how they feel, although I find that very unlikely, I am an optimist and hope that I can find reviews about this thing one day.

I don't think I'd truly ever wanna know how some people feel, the thought is somewhat scary. ",3
3c92b2c,"Venus, the Earth's twin or so we thought. With and atmosphere of ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide and average surface tempurture over eight hundred degrees. What dangers do we face trying to study Venus? Or why would we not try to find another place to substain human life?

Why is the author even suggest studying Venus?

Why does the author even support studying Venus? Venus's main atmosphere my be over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit but just above the cloud such as Earth there is a much calmer atmosphere. Thirty-plus miles above the surface, tempertures drop to around 170 degree ,but the air pressure returns to about the air pressure around sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful and radiaton wouldn't exceed Earth level. Not easy conditions to live in but survivable for humans.

Finding another place to substain human life is a nessisary thing because of the growing population on Earth ,and the ever present threat of gobal warming. Earth is not gonna be here forever and we need a place to live if all goes South. What would be the best place to substain life, well that has not been decided yet but what better way to start than learning about Earth's twin.

The author says "" If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even dicussing further vists to its surface? Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Even with past failures of trying to land on Venus the author supports the idea of exploring it. This is becasue of the thought that Earth will be like Venus in it life time.

The author completely supports further exploration on Venus even with the dangers. He belives it is worth the risk to learn more about where life can be substained, what Earth's future looks like, and to learn more about Venus's past.",3
bbe8844,"Technology has advanced in many ways in which no one can explain. From Iphones, to computers, to microwaves; technology does it all. But, can it tell us how we really feel better than we can? I don't believe so simply because we grow through things, not go through them. We have to feel the pain and the drive to continue on to do better for ourselves. Also where would our privacy go? We should expect someone is going to ask us what's wrong if the technology shows that we are 95% mad. In paragraph 6 it states that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" what if the teacher calls on the student and asks them what's wrong, is the student really going to tell the teacher? Most likely not so we have to put into consideration that people should get to keep how they feel private, it shouldn't be forced, and we shouldn't feel the need to tell anyone if we don't want to.

Emotions are what we use to stay motivated and driven. It may also tell us more about ourselves. What we choose to do about them is our business. One emotion that is a powerful one is love. Love is a beautiful thing and it keeps being beautiful because it is a secret passion for a person(s) we choose to share it with. If too many people find out about that love they might try to destroy it because it is not what they want. Then it stops becoming what we want.

If we get the technology that can tell us and everyone how we feel, we lose the passion and sincerity of truly caring about someone. We might just say,""Oh, I guess I got to go help them because their percentage on happiness is low,"" That is not sincere at all. We shouldn't be forced to care, it should just be in our nature to care. I also feel that people are going to be seen as a percentage now because in the pasage of paragraph 1, it said, ""She's 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry."" Why can't we all just accept that we are 100% human beings who have emotions and make mistakes. Not one single perosn is perfect and it's okay and completely normal for keeping them in and coping with them however we want.

I understand that it is good to tell people how you feel and what you are feeling, but it should be up to the person who is going through the pain to decide what they want to do. Give them time and they will be willing to spill their hearts. To me, all that the techology is doing is spilling our secrets, and hurting us even more. We don't want to feel like dissapointments and be charity cases so we don't spill our emotions. We also don't want to let someone know that they hurt us because then they might feel bad, and it just becomes a domino effect. I'm not saying to not tell people how you feel, but it should surely be up to you. Also, someone could completely lie about their feelings because maybe they've gotten good at doing it before. Maybe they've looked in the mirror and made sure to use the orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus to make it believable. We don't know what people are going thorugh and we also don't know how the person who has this information about us will act either.

Growing through experiances is one of the most beautiful things you can do because it shows that you have learned from it. That's what emotions are all about: growing. We don't stop the sun from growing seeds into beautiful, strong flowers, so we shouldn't stop humans from growing into beautiful, strong people. People who should have their privacy respected, people who shouldn't feel forced to be happy, and people who can choose how and who to talk to to handle one of life's many challenges. And happiness definitely shouldn't be based off of a percentage, but on our ability to become better and help eachother become better naturally. We all know what happens when we try to put things into our own hands and control things that shouldn't be controllled. Only love, being open- minded, acceptance, and sincerity can do that. ",4
78399a9,"you should join the ''Seagoing Cowboys Program''. You should join the program because it is a wonderful opertunity to see some amazing sites, interact with a lot of animals, and have a lot of fun during free time.

One reason you should join the ''Seagoing Cowboys Program'' is because all of the amazing sites. When I was part of the ''Seagoing Cowboys Program'' I had the opertunity to see a lot of amazing sites. I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Another reason you should join the ''Seagoing Cowboys Program'' is because all of the great times we have during free time on the boat. There is a lot of free time on board exspecially during the return trips after the animals have been unloaded. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

You also get to interact with a lot of animals. While you are sailing It takes about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings keeps you busy. They have to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls have to be cleaned. Although it is a lot of work, when you are doing these things with the animals it forms a bond between you and the animal.

There are some reasons why you should join the ''Seagoing cowboys Program''. I hope you will take the oppertunity to atleast look into the ''Seagoing Cowboys Program''.      ",3
a3f553c,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the authoor suggests that studying Venus is a bad thing to do and is very dangerous. The author gives a few reasons on why it is dangerous.

First, Venus is a very hot planet. People would sometimes think the hottest planet is Mercury because it is closer to the sun but it isn't the hottest. In paragraph 3 is explains that on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degreea, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. For example, diving to the deepest part of the oceans would liquefy many metals.

Second, a long time ago, Venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. But today, Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. So maybe a long time ago it would have been nice to visit but now, it isn't. Way to hot and it is covered all in rocks and valleys.

Lastly, in paragraph 5 it explains that ""Hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" So even if you wanted to try to go to Venus, you would die of heat. Your vehicle would not make it back.. you wouldn't either.

I think the author did good at supporting his idea with many reasons. The author gave many reasons why you shouldn't try to travel to Venus. ",3
089e8f5,"All I am imagining is a lot of arguements and court cases on drivers getting angry with manufactures, and manufactures getting fighting back, claiming it is not their fault. If driverless cars are introduced to the rest of the world, there will me so many accidents and court cases that will be very tricky, because no one knows who is at fault. I believe that driverless cars are not reliable, at least not yet, and I know that I would not use a driverless car unless there are a lot of improvements made.

Sometimes machines just shut down and stop working for no apparent reason. Sometimes there are problems with robotic things that no one knows why the problem is occuring. In paragraph 2 it explains that, ""they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" This shows that the cars, at least not yet can work all on there own. The driver still has to be alert and watching the road at all times, because at anytime the car could see something that it does not think it could handle, so the driver has to be ready at any time to step in and be ready to take over. Then again, machines sometimes have problems that just occur for no apparent reason, so maybe the car could just shut down and might not alert the driver so then right away there is a risk of a crash. Who then is at fault. In paragraph 9, it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?"" If this happens who is to blame? The driver was told that they would be alterted when something the car couldn't handle occurs, but if the driver isn't alerted, then it must be the manufactures fault. But wait, the manufacurers made it clear thar the driver still has to be watching, and if they were not, then again, who is to blame? There are so many questions that either can't be answered, or take a lot of time to figure the answer out.

I personaly would not even think about using a driverless car until the manufactures figure out all the problems with the safty issues. It is not just the car itself that there needs to be work done on, according to paragraph 9, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times...even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" There are so many laws that would have to change and be made. So even if there are improvement on the car itself there are still also so many other things that you have to consider when thinking of using a driverless car.

I don't know after reading this passage, if I would ever really feel safe trusting a machine with my life and even of those around me. There are so many issues still that need to be fixed before I would consider testing one out. I need to make sure that myself and those around me would be safe if something were to go wrong with the car. Driverless cars are a new and interesting idea, but they need a lot of work to be done on them before they would be safe enough to be introduced to the rest of the world.",4
7a0e3ae,"It is in the best interest of the people that you do away with the Electoral College. When people vote, they want it to be a direct vote to the election, not a vote for their chosen candidate's electors. The Electoral College should be abolished because it doesn't guarantee your vote, the House's selection can't be expected to reflect the will of the people, and swing voters could cause a catastrophe.

To begin, the Electoral College should be abolished because it doesn't guarantee your vote. As stated before, when you vote, there is no say in who actually wins the election. You are voting for electors who then vote for the President. While it is a rare occurance, those Electors may betray you and vote for the other party, cancelling your vote totally out. If a candidate gets the most popular votes, that doesn't guarantee them as President, because they still have to get the Electoral College's votes. In the third source titled, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, it reads, ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888."" This sentence means that President Bush won with fewer popular votes and more electoral votes. If their was no Electoral College, Al Gore would've won the election. The people would've thought that Al Gore was going to win, and they were probably in for a surprise when they saw that Bush had won with fewer popular votes. It just goes to show that an election can go either way, and there is no closure for a candidate until it is actually announced who won.

Next, the House's selection can't be expected to reflect the will of the people. Say a Republican candidate gets a majority of the popular votes, but the Democratic candidate wins because he is chosen by the Electoral College. The people of the United States might actually feel betrayed because they felt that the Republican party could benefit the economy and society best, and that President might not be up-to-par and disappoint the people. Also in the third article, it reads ""...to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president."" The statement really says a lot about both sides of the argument. If there is an Electoral College and if their isn't an Electoral College, people could still feel this way. If a candidate who has less popular votes wins, then those states that voted for him/her might feel as if they ""will have no regard for their interests"".

Lastly, swing voters could cause a catastrophe. Swing states could be considered manipulative because they all know that the popular vote rests in their hands. Will it be Democratic or Republican? You never know. The candidates focus mainly on campaigning in these states because these are the ones that are half and half, states such as Ohio. While there are thoughtful voters, there are also ones who could care less about who the President is and just want to keep America on the edge of her seat while they decide who they want to vote for. In the second source, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" is says ""In 1976, a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way."" The states are swing states and they truly determine the fate of the election. As said before, those states get the most attention from the candidates, who try to make themselves as appealing as possible. In the second source as well, the author says ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Rhode Island and South Carolina are states that are almost entirely for one party so there is no use in the opposite party going there to try and persaude them to change their minds because it is most likely not going to happen. While they may feel neglected, it's just how it is.

To conclude, the Electoral College should be banished because it doesn't guarantee your vote, the House's selection cannot be expected to reflect the will of the people, and swing voters could cause a catastrophe.    ",5
d8c9e3d,"The devlopment of driverless cars should not be continued due to, conflicts with traffic laws, the failure and price of the technology required and the ambiguoity of who is at fault in times of accidents.

Traffic laws are designed to secure the safety of all drivers on the rode, but said laws can become irrelevant if the driver does not have complete control of his or her vehicle. The text states, ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" This piece of text evidence exemplifies how lawmakers pass driving laws with the mindset the driver is alert while on the road; however driverless cars do not require the driver to be alert, which could result in accidents in the future. The text also states, ""...traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result in most states it is illegal to even test computer driven cars."" From this example we have insight on how lawmakers make laws: with the assumption that all cars have a human driver. If the human driver is taken out of the equation, then the safety of others on the road simply cannot be guaranteed with a car operating on its own.

Technology works to our benefit at times, but it is not flawless. The text Sebastian Thrun says, ""...Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasn't something you could bay at Radio Shack."" In other words Trun is telling about the price of such techonology and it was not an item average people could just buy. The text also states, ""...uses position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor.... LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form constantly updatint 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" From this example we receive insight on the intricate technology involved in making a such a car run. Most people would argue that the technology is tested and proven safe; however, the fact lingers that technology can fail at unpredictable times. The price of the technology required to run the driverless car, as well as the possible failure in technology will remain an obstacle.

When accidents happen, in most cases the driver at fault can be determined; this becomes ambigious with driverless cars. The text states, ""[With driverless cars] new laws will be needed to cover liability in the case of an accident."" This example shows how new laws would need to be passed to determine who is held accountable at times of accidents. The text also states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This example shows how it can be unclear in times of accidents if who is to blame for accidents, and in extreme cases even the manufacturers could even be blamed. Drvierless cars would raise a new issue of requiring new traffic laws and the ambigiouity of who is responsible when accidents occur.

The development of driverless cars should not be continued due to, conflicts with current traffic laws, the failure and sheer price of the technology required to run the vehhicle, and the ambigiouity of who is liable at times of accidents.",4

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a thing alot of people should do. We help out with alot of stuff such as animals, and problems that where hard to solve after World War 2. You could also see amazing sights. I'm going to tell you all about the Seagoing Cowboys program.

In 1945 we had to help with horses in New Orleans. We had to make sure they had enough hay and oats to be fed with. Although there was 335 horses to feed we still helped out. For instance we crossed the alantic ocean for 2 weeks, just to get to China to help out. First,We fed them, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower parts of the ship. Then all the stalls had to be cleaned.

If you joined this program you would get to see amazing sights. Its a once in a lifetime chance to travel to China, Europe, Venice,and Italy. I got to explore the castel in Crete and marvel at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There is so many sights to be marveled at or explored. You should try this out.

There is so much more than helping animals and seeing amazing monuments and sights. You would also get to help people. There are lots of people out there who dont have much food or any shelter. World War 2 is the cause of this harm to people. First of all, helping people could give you a good reputation. Secondly, its nice to help people who are poor and don't have shelter or food. Lastly, I think it is a good thing to do for those people.

People fought in World War 2 and now its your turn to step up and lend a helping hand. This program is possibly the most helpfullest program in the U.S.A.                    ",3

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author shows the use of emotion reading technology is valuable in the classroom.

The software can be extremely benificial in a classroom setting helping teachers and student adapt lesson plans to better help the student learn. With the system in your computer it can tell if you are mad or confused and can adapt the lesson to better fill the need of the individuel student. It individualizes each lesson to better fit the need of the student and to help them learn. This not only benifits the student so the lesson better fits them but helps the teacher teach in a way that gives each kid one on one attention ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (6)

With this system in place classrooms can become more individualized and better reach each students needs while catering to the entire class rather than the individual. The System would act as a human to ""preform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday"" like humans do everyday accessing situations. If humans use this it can better expand our knowledge of each other and how each person works. The Facial Acting Coding system not only benifits the students learning but makes the teachers teaching more effective.

The use of emotional reading in the classroom is extremely valuable. The system increases the capability of the teacher and the learning of the student. With it classrooms become individually tailored without taking the time of the teacher on one kid. Every student is different and has different needs and this software can help make it to schools can better meet the needs.
