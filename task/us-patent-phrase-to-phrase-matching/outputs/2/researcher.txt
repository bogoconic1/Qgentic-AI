You never write production code yourself; instead you uncover how the dataset behaves so the developer can build a winning solution with evidence on hand.\n\nPrimary mandate:\n- Build a deep understanding of the dataset before recommending any modeling steps.\n- Alternate between forming hypotheses and confirming them with the `ask_eda` tool.\n- Do not rely on memory or intuition when data can be inspected.\n\nTooling:\n- `ask_eda(question)` executes Python against the local dataset. Use it to quantify distributions, check data quality, look for leakage, and validate every key assumption.\n\nOperating principles (competition-agnostic):\n1. Start by clarifying the target variable(s), feature space(s), and evaluation metric(s) from the competition description.\n2. Investigate label balance or distribution, missing values, feature ranges, and dataset size.\n3. Examine the structure of the input data (e.g., length distributions, numerical scales, categorical cardinalities, sequence lengths, or image dimensions).\n4. Probe for potential leakage, ordering effects (temporal, spatial, or otherwise), or train/test distribution shifts.\n5. Only stop calling tools once each major recommendation in your final plan cites concrete evidence from tool outputs.\n6. Keep each tool call focused on one hypothesis at a time and follow up if results are inconclusive.\n\nDeliverable:\n- A step-by-step technical plan for the Developer. For every recommendation, reference the dataset insight that motivated it (e.g., “Class distribution is skewed toward label 6 per Tool Run #2; therefore we…”) and highlight remaining risks or unanswered questions.\n\nCompetition Description:\n# Overview\n\n## Description\n\nCan you extract meaning from a large, text-based dataset derived from inventions? Here\'s your chance to do so.\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) offers one of the largest repositories of scientific, technical, and commercial information in the world through its\xa0[Open Data Portal](https://developer.uspto.gov/about-open-data). Patents are a form of\xa0[intellectual property](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/basics/general-information-patents)\xa0granted in exchange for the public disclosure of new and useful inventions. Because patents undergo an intensive\xa0[vetting process](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/InventionCon2020_Understanding_the_Patent_Examination_Process.pdf)\xa0prior to grant, and because the history of U.S. innovation spans over two centuries and 11 million patents, the U.S. patent archives stand as a rare combination of data volume, quality, and diversity.\n\n> "The USPTO serves an American innovation machine that never sleeps by granting patents, registering trademarks, and promoting intellectual property around the globe. The USPTO shares over 200 years\' worth of human ingenuity with the world, from lightbulbs to quantum computers. Combined with creativity from the data science community, USPTO datasets carry unbounded potential to empower AI and ML models that will benefit the progress of science and society at large."\n>\n> --- USPTO Chief Information Officer Jamie Holcombe\n\nIn this competition, you will train your models on a novel semantic similarity dataset to extract relevant information by matching key phrases in patent documents. Determining the semantic similarity between phrases is critically important during the patent search and examination process to determine if an invention has been described before. For example, if one invention claims "television set" and a prior publication describes "TV set", a model would ideally recognize these are the same and assist a patent attorney or examiner in retrieving relevant documents. This extends beyond paraphrase identification; if one invention claims a "strong material" and another uses "steel", that may also be a match. What counts as a "strong material" varies per domain (it may be steel in one domain and ripstop fabric in another, but you wouldn\'t want your parachute made of steel). We have included the Cooperative Patent Classification as the technical domain context as an additional feature to help you disambiguate these situations.\n\nCan you build a model to match phrases in order to extract contextual information, thereby helping the patent community connect the dots between millions of patent documents?\n\n> This is a Code Competition.

Kaggle. https://kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching\n\n\n# Data\n\n## Dataset Description\n\nIn this dataset, you are presented pairs of phrases (an\xa0`anchor`\xa0and a\xa0`target`\xa0phrase) and asked to rate how similar they are on a scale from 0 (not at all similar) to 1 (identical in meaning). This challenge differs from a standard semantic similarity task in that similarity has been scored here within a patent\'s\xa0`context`, specifically its\xa0[CPC classification (version 2021.05)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Patent_Classification), which indicates the subject to which the patent relates. For example, while the phrases "bird" and "Cape Cod" may have low semantic similarity in normal language, the likeness of their meaning is much closer if considered in the context of "house".\n\nThis is a code competition, in which you will submit code that will be run against an unseen test set. The unseen test set contains approximately 12k pairs of phrases. A small public test set has been provided for testing purposes, but is not used in scoring.\n\nInformation on the meaning of CPC codes may be found on the\xa0[USPTO website](https://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/cpc/html/cpc.html). The CPC version 2021.05 can be found on the\xa0[CPC archive website](https://www.cooperativepatentclassification.org/Archive).\n\n## Score meanings\n\nThe scores are in the 0-1 range with increments of 0.25 with the following meanings:\n\n- **1.0**\xa0- Very close match. This is typically an exact match except possibly for differences in conjugation, quantity (e.g. singular vs. plural), and addition or removal of stopwords (e.g. "the", "and", "or").\n- **0.75**\xa0- Close synonym, e.g. "mobile phone" vs. "cellphone". This also includes abbreviations, e.g. "TCP" -> "transmission control protocol".\n- **0.5**\xa0- Synonyms which don\'t have the same meaning (same function, same properties). This includes broad-narrow (hyponym) and narrow-broad (hypernym) matches.\n- **0.25**\xa0- Somewhat related, e.g. the two phrases are in the same high level domain but are not synonyms. This also includes antonyms.\n- **0.0**\xa0- Unrelated.\n\nFiles\n-----\n\n- **train.csv**\xa0- the training set, containing phrases, contexts, and their similarity scores\n- **test.csv**\xa0- the test set set, identical in structure to the training set but without the score\n- **sample_submission.csv**\xa0- a sample submission file in the correct format\n\nColumns\n-------\n\n- `id`\xa0- a unique identifier for a pair of phrases\n- `anchor`\xa0- the first phrase\n- `target`\xa0- the second phrase\n- `context`\xa0- the\xa0[CPC classification (version 2021.05)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Patent_Classification), which indicates the subject within which the similarity is to be scored\n- `score`\xa0- the similarity.

I need to investigate the dataset for the US Patent Phrase to Phrase Matching competition. The main goal is to predict the similarity score between two phrases (anchor and target) within a specific CPC context.\n\nFirst, I should clarify the structure of the dataset. The competition description mentions columns: id, anchor, target, context, score. The evaluation is Pearson correlation, so we need to predict continuous scores between 0 and 1 in increments of 0.25.\n\nHypothesis 1: The score distribution is skewed. Maybe most scores are in the middle range (0.5 or 0.25), or maybe there\'s a particular class that\'s more common. Let me check the distribution of the \'score\' column.\n\nAlso, check for missing values in key columns like anchor, target, context, score. If there are missing values, we need to handle them.\n\nAnother point: check if \'context\' is a CPC code, which probably refers to a classification code. For example, \'A61K\' or something like that. The context might map to a more detailed description, but the dataset might not include the actual title, just the code. So maybe the context codes need to be mapped to their descriptions using external data, but the data description says the CPC column is the actual classification code. Let\'s check the cardinality of the \'context\' column. How many unique context codes are there?\n\nAlso, check the length of anchor and target phrases. Maybe they have specific lengths. For example, maximum length of words or characters. But maybe the tokens are too long, so we need to know the max sequence length for model input.\n\nAnother thing: check if there\'s any leakage between train and test sets. How about checking if the same \'id\' appears multiple times? But probably not. Maybe check if the same anchor-target pairs appear in both train and test with different scores. But since test doesn\'t have score, perhaps check if the same anchor and target in same context exist across sets. But maybe context differs, but the pair is same. However, in real-world data, maybe some phrases are repeated but in different contexts. But need to check.\n\nWait, also check if the training and test datasets have different distributions. For example, in context codes, or in the score distribution. That would mean train-test shift, which is bad.\n\nLet\'s start with the most basic EDA steps.\n\nFirst question: What is the distribution of the score? Let\'s check how many samples for each score value. The scores are 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0.\n\nSecond: Check number of unique values for anchor, target, context. Maybe anchor and target have many unique values, which is expected. But perhaps some anchors or targets are repeated multiple times in the dataset.\n\nThird: Check missing values. Are there any nulls in anchor, target, context, score columns?\n\nFourth: Sample a few entries to check the structure. Like the actual content of anchor, target, context. For example, what does a context look like? Is it just the code (like \'A\', \'B\', \'C\')? Or multi-character (like \'A01B\' for agriculture)?\n\nWait, the CPC codes are alphanumeric and have hierarchical structure (section, class, subclass, group). So example: A01B - section A, class 01, subclass B. So the context might look like \'A01B\' or \'A01B1\'.\n\nBut when loading the data, in the train.csv, what is in the context column?\n\nAlso, for the training data, check how many samples per context code. Are some contexts very rare?\n\nAnother thing: maybe count the number of words in anchor and target. Let\'s say, average word count, max, min. But for text-based models, knowing the token length is important.\n\nBut first, start with the basics.\n\nLet\'s ask the first EDA question: "What is the distribution of scores in the training set, including count of each score value?"\n\nThen, check for nulls in all columns.\n\nThen check unique context codes count and how many samples per context.\n\nAlso check the average length of anchor and target strings (maybe characters or words), but maybe characters would be better for tokenization.\n\nWait, but the competition uses tokenizers, so maybe knowing total character length, but more importantly, checking the maximum string length so we know how to set max_seq_len for the model.\n\nBut maybe for the first steps:\n\nStep 1: Check score distribution.\nStep 2: Check missing values.\nStep 3: Check unique context counts and their frequency.\nStep 4: Check the structure of context values (how many characters, letters, etc.)\nStep 5: Check the length of anchor and target.\n\nLet\'s start with the first one.\n\nUse ask_eda to get score distribution.\n\nHypothesis: The scores are roughly uniformly distributed or some are more common. Maybe there\'s a class imbalance.\n\nAnother thing: Check the score categories. The problem states scores are in 0.25 increments, so possible values are 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0. So exactly 5 classes. Check if all are present.\n\nLet\'s check that first. Maybe some scores are not present, like 0.75 or 1.0.\n\nAlso, check the count per value.\n\nSo first tool call: ask_eda "What is the distribution of scores in the training set? Please list the counts for each score value."\n\nThen next, check for nulls: "Are there any missing values in the training set columns? If yes, which columns and how many?"\n\nThen, check context: "What are the unique context codes in the training set, and how many samples per context?"\n\nThen, check whether the same context codes exist in the test set. But to check that, need to also ask about test set\'s context.\n\nWait, but the competition description says test.csv contains approximately 12k pairs. The train set probably has more. So we need to check if the context codes in test are a subset of train, or if there\'s overlap.\n\nBut maybe before that, check train context unique counts and test context unique counts.\n\nBut first, let\'s ask about train context.\n\nAnother thing: check if there are duplicate rows in the dataset, excluding the id column. For example, same anchor, target, context, but different scores. That would be an issue.\n\nBut need to check.\n\nBut let\'s start with the first questions.\n\nAlso, check if \'id\' is unique.

The user is asking about the distribution of scores in the training set. The response from the tool shows the counts for each score value. Let me parse that.\n\nSo scores are 0.0 (6774), 0.25 (10306), 0.5 (11068), 0.75 (3634), and 1.0 (1043). Total 32,825 records. \n\nFirst, checking the balance. The scores are in increments of 0.25 from 0.0 to 1.0. The counts vary a lot. 0.5 has the highest count at over 11,000, which makes sense as the middle range. But 0.25 is next with ~10k, then 0.0 is ~6.7k, 0.75 is ~3.6k, and 1.0 is lowest at ~1k. So the distribution is skewed towards the middle scores (0.5 and 0.25), but there\'s a significant number of 0.0 as well. The higher scores (0.75 and 1.0) are much less frequent. That\'s important for the model because if the evaluation is Pearson correlation, which measures linear relationship, but the model has to predict continuous values. However, the class imbalance could affect how the model learns the extremes. For example, maybe the model tends to predict more towards the middle because there are more samples there. But Pearson correlation isn\'t directly affected by class imbalance in classification as it\'s a regression task. Wait, but score is continuous, but in reality it\'s discrete steps of 0.25. So maybe the model should output values that are multiples of 0.25? But sometimes models might predict values between them, then clip to nearest step. But the evaluation is Pearson, so it might care about the continuous values. Wait, but the actual scores are discrete, but the Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and actual would be computed based on the actual values. So maybe the model predictions should be continuous, but the actual targets are discrete. However, in practice, models sometimes predict continuous and then round to the proper step. But Pearson can handle that as long as the trend is there.\n\nBut looking at the distribution, there\'s a lot more samples in 0.5 and 0.25. So maybe the model could be biased towards those scores if not handled properly. But perhaps the key is how the scores are distributed. Let\'s confirm: 0.5 is about 33.7% of the data, 0.25 is ~31.4%, 0.0 is ~20.6%, 0.75 ~11.1%, and 1.0 ~3.2%. So 0.0 is third most common. The highest is 0.5, then 0.25, 0.0. So the low scores (0.0, 0.25) combined are about 52% of data. Mid scores 0.5 is next. Then high scores (0.75 and 1.0) together ~14.3%. So the model needs to predict across all values, but higher scores are rarer. \n\nAnother thing to check: maybe the context affects the distribution. For example, certain contexts might have more 1.0 scores. But that\'s for later steps. First, the initial hypothesis is about the score distribution. The initial tools response confirms that the scores are distributed unevenly. The current insight is that the distribution is imbalanced, with certain scores like 0.5 being common, and 1.0 being rare. This could lead to issues where the model doesn\'t generalize well to the less frequent scores, but since Pearson correlation measures the entire distribution\'s correlation, maybe the model still needs to predict accurately across all classes. \n\nSo the next step would be to check the structure of the input data: anchor, target, context fields. How long are they? Are there missing values? Let\'s check.\n\nFirst, check for missing values in the dataset. So maybe run ask_eda for missing values in each column.\n\nAlso, check the distribution of anchor lengths, target lengths, context lengths. Maybe the context is a CPC code, which may have a standard format. For example, CPC codes like A61D1/00. So perhaps the context is a string of varying lengths.\n\nAlso, the competition description said "context" is the CPC classification version 2021.05. So each context code is like a combination of letters and numbers. For example, A, A23, A61, etc. But looking at the data, maybe context strings have different lengths. \n\nSo next question for ask_eda: check for missing values in anchor, target, context. And look at the lengths of each.\n\nAlso, the anchor and target: how long are the phrases? Maybe they vary a lot. Let\'s ask for average length, max length, min, etc.\n\nSo possible next tool calls:\n\n1. Check missing values for all columns.\n2. Check distribution of anchor, target, and context lengths.\n3.

But the id is unique, so probably not. Still, check if there\'s duplicate content across different ids.\n\nAlso, the context codes. The competition description says that CPC is a classification system. Let\'s check the unique contexts. How many different contexts are there?\n\nAlso, maybe look at the anchor and target text for some examples. What\'s the structure? Are they noun phrases? Maybe check for common prefixes or suffixes.\n\nAnother thing: check for data leakage. For example, maybe there\'s some overlap between anchor and target in certain contexts.

Since transformer models have sequence length limits.\n\nAnother possible check: check if there\'s any correlation between the context and the score. Like, maybe certain contexts have higher average scores. But perhaps better to check the distribution of scores per context.\n\nBut let\'s start with the context. How many unique contexts in the training set. Also, count of each context. Since CPC codes can be hierarchical, maybe the first letter is the class, then more digits. But the context column might be like \'A\', \'A01\', \'A01B\', etc.\n\nFor example, let\'s ask about unique contexts and their counts.\n\nAlso, check the number of unique anchor and target phrases. How many unique anchors and unique targets in the dataset. This can help to know if there\'s repetition in the same phrases across different contexts.\n\nFor example, if an anchor like \'power inverter\' appears in multiple contexts, each paired with different targets. But if the same anchor-target pair occurs in the same context but different scores, that\'s a problem. But since ids are unique, maybe duplicates in anchor + target + context. Let\'s check if there are duplicates in those three columns.\n\nWait, the data description says "For each id representing a pair of phrases", so each pair has an id. So the triplet (anchor, target, context) should be unique per id? Not necessarily, unless specified. But usually, in datasets like this, the same pair might not be repeated, but possible.\n\nBut to check that, need to see if (anchor, target, context) combinations are unique.

Let\'s check the distribution.\n\nAlternatively, check the cardinality of the context column. Number of unique context codes.\n\nAnother angle: check the average length of anchor and target strings. Maybe token counts.\n\nBut to be efficient, let\'s ask for the counts of unique contexts. Let\'s see.\n\nSo next tool call: ask_eda question: "How many unique context codes are present in the training data, and what are their top 10 most frequent contexts with counts?"\n\nThat would give a sense of the context distribution. Knowing this, we can check if certain contexts are overrepresented. For example, maybe a few contexts have most of the samples, which could be a problem for generalization.\n\nAlternatively, check for distribution within contexts. Like, average score per context. But perhaps first, check what the available contexts are.\n\nAlso, check the distribution of anchor and target lengths. For example, what\'s the average, max, min character length. Or token length.\n\nWait, but character length might be correlated with tokens. But maybe we can find max lengths to set tokenization parameters.\n\nSo perhaps the next step is to check:\n\n1. Unique context codes and their frequency.\n\n2. Length distributions of anchor and target.\n\n3. Check for duplicates in (anchor, target, context) that have different scores.\n\nLet me start with context unique counts.\n\nSo the question would be: "How many unique context codes are in the training data?

Maybe token counts.\n\nBut to be efficient, let\'s ask for the counts of unique contexts. Let\'s see.\n\nSo next tool call: ask_eda question: "How many unique context codes are present in the training data, and what are their top 10 most frequent contexts with counts?"\n\nThat would give a sense of the context distribution. Knowing this, we can check if certain contexts are overrepresented. For example, maybe a few contexts have most of the samples, which could be a problem for generalization.\n\nAlternatively, check for distribution within contexts. Like, average score per context. But perhaps first, check what the available contexts are.\n\nAlso, check the distribution of anchor and target lengths. For example, what\'s the average, max, min character length. Or token length.\n\nWait, but character length might be correlated with tokens. But maybe we can find max lengths to set tokenization parameters.\n\nSo perhaps the next step is to check:\n\n1. Unique context codes and their frequency.\n\n2. Length distributions of anchor and target.\n\n3. Check for duplicates in (anchor, target, context) that have different scores.\n\nLet me start with context unique counts.\n\nSo the question would be: "How many unique context codes are in the training data? Show the top 10 most frequent contexts by count."\n\nYes.

The user is working on the US Patent Phrase to Phrase Matching competition. They\'ve started by asking about the score distribution, missing values, and context codes.\n\nFirst, the score distribution. The counts are 0.0:6774, 0.25:10306, 0.5:11068, 0.75:3634, 1.0:1043. Total 32825 records. The distribution is skewed; most scores are in the 0.25 and 0.5 buckets, with 0.5 being the highest. 0.75 and 1.0 are less common, which makes sense because exact matches (1.0) are rare. The leaderboard uses Pearson correlation, so maybe the model needs to handle the skewed distribution, especially since the majority are mid-range scores. But Pearson isn\'t sensitive to class imbalance per se, but maybe the model might need to account for the mean score being around 0.4 or something, but Pearson is about linear correlation, so maybe not directly impacted by imbalance, but the variance across scores might matter.\n\nThen missing values: all columns have zero missing. That\'s good. No cleaning needed there. All rows have complete data across the board.\n\nNext, context codes: 106 unique, top 10 are H04, H01, G01, A61, etc. counts around 800-1900. So the context codes aren\'t too skewed, but some are more common than others. The top 10 make up roughly (1962+1956+...+788) /32825. Let\'s see: 1962+1956=3918, +1633=5551, +1312=6863, +970=7833, +964=8797, +954=9751, +822=10573, +810=11383, +788=12171. So top 10 is about 12k out of 32k, so about 37%. So the rest 69 codes have lower counts. Important for handling contextual information. The CPC codes are part of the data, and the problem states that context matters for the similarity.\n\nNow, next steps. What else needs checking? Let\'s think. The task is to determine the semantic similarity between anchor and target given the context. So maybe we need to check if there\'s a relationship between context and the scores. For example, certain contexts might have different score distributions. Also, how do anchor and target lengths vary? For example, maybe some phrases are longer than others, which could affect model performance.\n\nAnother thing: are the anchor and target unique? Like, maybe some anchors are repeated with different contexts and targets, which might be useful for the model.\n\nAlso, check if the context codes\' textual descriptions are known. Wait, in the data description, there\'s mention of CPC codes, but the actual data has the context code (like H04), but perhaps the context code is not the full desc, just the code. The support baseline notes mention converting CPC context text from external files. So maybe the \'context\' column is just the base code (e.g., \'H04\'), and there\'s a need to map those to their actual descriptions. But the dataset provided (train.csv) has the context codes, but the actual description of what H04 means might be in another file. However, the current data provided for the competition might not include the descriptions. But the support notes say "Merge test dataframe with CPC titles using the \'context\' column to enrich context with corresponding titles". So perhaps there\'s an external file with CPC titles. But for now, the ask_eda can check the context codes and their distributions. But the next step maybe is to check if the same context code can have different scores for different anchor-target pairs.\n\nWait, another thing: check the number of unique anchors and unique targets. Maybe there\'s overlap between training and test, but since it\'s a code competition, we don\'t have test data yet. But the problem is to check for leakage. So, possible data leakage: if anchor or target in train has overlap with test, but the test data is unseen. But to check leakage, we need to see if there\'s any overlap of id\'s or pairs of (anchor, target, context) that might be duplicated. But the ids are unique for each pair, so probably the same pair would not appear in train and test. But maybe some anchors or targets are reused in different contexts.\n\nBut since we don\'t have test data, perhaps we can\'t directly check overlap with test. However, for now, we need to check within train. Also, check for duplicate entries or inconsistencies.\n\nAlso, check the statistics of the phrases themselves: lengths of anchor, target. Maybe their character or token counts. For example, if most anchors are very short vs long, how does that affect.\n\nSo possible next EDA steps:\n\n1. Check anchor and target text lengths (character and word counts).\n\n2. How many unique anchors and targets.\n\n3. For each context, check score distribution. Does a certain context have consistently higher or lower scores?\n\n4. Check for the presence of CPC codes in the text or whether the context text needs to be mapped. But since the data has context codes, and the description mentions the CPC version, but the actual context is code, then for EDA, maybe check if there\'s an external mapping. But in the current data, the \'context\' column is the code, like H04. So perhaps the text description of context is not provided in train.csv, but needs to be merged from another source. The support baseline notes mention merging with CPC titles. So for EDA, maybe check how many unique context codes exist, which has been done (106), but also maybe check if the context codes correspond to meaningful classes. But the question here may be: if the context codes are just codes, is there additional metadata? But the current dataset might not include that, so maybe that\'s part of the preprocessing step needed (merging with CPC title files), but for the EDA, maybe we can\'t do that yet. So perhaps the next step is to check the text lengths and uniqueness.\n\nAdditionally, check if the same anchor-target pair with same context appears multiple times with same or different scores. But the id is unique, so probably each record is unique. But maybe same anchor and target in same context having same or different scores. But with id unique, it\'s possible that same anchor-target-context might be duplicated, but the scores differ. But perhaps we should check for duplicates.\n\nSo let\'s proceed.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- Check unique anchors: how many unique anchor values.\n\n- How many duplicates in (anchor, target, context) triplets?\n\n- Average, max, min character length for anchor and target.\n\n- Check if the context codes have different distributions in train vs test, but since we don\'t have test data (except the public one), but the problem says the public test set is provided for testing, but not used in scoring. So if the user has access to the public test data, perhaps they should check train vs public test distributions.\n\nBut the competition description says "A small public test set has been provided for testing purposes, but is not used in scoring." So perhaps the user can check the public test set for differences, but the ask_eda tool is run on the dataset. Wait, but in the initial problem setup, the team is using the provided train.csv and test.csv. So need to check both train and test.\n\nWait, in the problem description: the competition dataset includes train.csv, test.csv, sample_submission.csv.\n\nSo the data available for EDA includes train.csv and test.csv.\n\nSo next steps could be:\n\nCheck the distribution of context codes in test vs train to see if there\'s a shift.\n\nCheck the score distribution in train vs public test (but test.csv doesn\'t have score). So for test, can check anchor, target, context.\n\nBut since test has no scores, perhaps for the test\'s context code counts, etc., to check if same distribution.\n\nBut let\'s see.\n\nFirst, check the distribution of context in test.csv.\n\nBut let\'s first get the next steps. So after checking the train: scores, missing, context codes.\n\nNext: check text statistics of anchor and target for train.\n\nFor example, what\'s the average length (characters), word count for anchor and target.\n\nAlso, check the count of unique anchors and targets.\n\nAlso, check how many duplicate rows for (anchor, target, context) in train.\n\nCheck for any signs of leakage: e.g., same (anchor, target, context) appears multiple times with different scores, which could be a problem. But maybe the same triplet has same score.\n\nWait, for example, if a triplet (A, B, C) appears twice with different scores, then their id is different, but the dataset has inconsistencies. But the problem statement says that each id is a unique pair. But according to the data description, the id is a unique identifier for each pair. So the same pair (anchor, target, context) should have same score, but perhaps maybe not. But if they have different scores, that\'s a data quality issue.\n\nSo maybe check for duplicate (anchor, target, context) triples with differing scores.\n\nBut first, check the number of unique anchors, targets.\n\nLet\'s proceed with that.\n\nNow, for the next tool call: maybe ask about anchor and target lengths.\n\nOr check unique anchors and targets.\n\nAlternatively, check the uniqueness of the triplets.\n\nSo possible next questions: "What is the average character length of anchor and target phrases in the training set?" and "What is the distribution of character counts for anchor and target?"\n\nAlso, "How many unique anchor and target values are in the training data?"\n\nAlso, "How many duplicate entries exist where the same (anchor, target, context) triplet has different scores?"\n\nBut also, check the test.csv for context code counts compared to train.\n\nBut since the team might not have test data in memory, perhaps the ask_eda can query test.csv too.\n\nAlternatively, the initial call for training set, now check test set.\n\nLet\'s proceed.\n\nWait, the current state:\n\n- Train score distribution is known.\n\n- Missing values all zero.\n\n- Context code counts known for train.\n\nNow, perhaps check anchors and targets.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst, ask for the character length distribution of anchor and target in train.\n\nNext, compare test data.\n\nBut let\'s start with train.\n\nFor example:\n\n"How many unique anchor and target values are present in the training data?"\n\nBut also, the length statistics.\n\nLet me think of the question structure.\n\nFor example:\n\n"Show the character length distribution of anchor and target columns in the training data, including min, max, mean, and median."\n\nAlso, "What is the distribution of word counts for anchor and target?"\n\nBut maybe the team wants specific details.\n\nAlternatively, "How many unique anchor values and unique target values are there in the training data?"\n\nLet\'s do that.\n\nSo next tool call: "How many unique anchors and targets are in the training data?"\n\nThen check the length stats.\n\nBut also, maybe check the context distribution in test.csv.\n\nWait, the data has test.csv. So for the context codes in test, let\'s check how many and the top 10 same as train?\n\nIf context codes in test have different distribution, there could be a shift.\n\nSimilarly, for anchor and target lengths.\n\nSo perhaps next steps include checking test data\'s context codes and other attributes.\n\nSo for example, "How many unique context codes in test.csv?" and "Top 10 contexts in test."\n\nBut since the public test set is small but provided, but the actual competition test set is hidden, but for now, the data provided for EDA would include test.csv.\n\nSo the EDA tool can run on both train and test.\n\nSo let\'s check test\'s context codes.\n\nAlternatively, to check for train vs test distribution of context codes.\n\nSo first, get context counts for test.\n\nSo next tool call: "What is the distribution of context codes in test.csv? Show top 10."\n\nBut since the user needs to know both train and test to see shift.\n\nYes.\n\nAlso, check the number of rows in test.\n\nThe test set size is specified as approximately 12k pairs. But in the actual public test.csv, the size may be a portion of that. But regardless, the tool can check the size.\n\nBut given the team\'s prior steps, the next step is to check test\'s context code counts and compare with train.\n\nSo current state: after checking train\'s context top 10 (H04, H01, etc.), perhaps the test\'s context distribution may be similar or different.\n\nSo next steps:\n\nCheck test\'s context distribution.\n\nCheck train/test for anchor/target uniqueness or length.\n\nCheck duplicates in train.\n\nSo let\'s proceed.\n\nFirst, how many unique anchors in train?\n\nSo next question: "How many unique anchor and target values exist in the training data?"\n\nThen, "What are the top 10 most common anchor values and their counts?"\n\nBut maybe also check if the top anchors are context-dependent.\n\nBut perhaps start simple.\n\nAnother thing: perhaps the anchor and target have a lot of unique values, which suggests that they\'re diverse, which may make it harder for the model unless it\'s transfer learning on good embeddings.\n\nBut for now, proceed with the tool calls.\n\nSo, for context in test: "What is the distribution of context codes in the test set? Show the top 10 most frequent contexts and their counts."\n\nAlso, for anchor and target in train.\n\nWait, the tools are called with ask_eda questions.\n\nSo first, check unique anchors and targets in train.\n\nAsk: "How many unique anchor and target values are there in the training data?"\n\nNext, check the top anchor values.\n\nBut let\'s see. The previous answers were about training data only. Now the next step.\n\nWait, maybe also check the context codes in the test set to compare with train.\n\nSo let\'s do that next.\n\nSo the next tool call would be:\n\n"Show context code counts in test dataset, top 10."\n\nBut maybe more generally to check the number of unique contexts in test, and see if they match train\'s distribution.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n"Display context code counts in test.csv\'s context column."\n\nBut since the tool can\'t see which file, but in Kaggle competitions, the train.csv and test.csv are in the same directory, so the ask_eda function can query against them.\n\nSo the question should specify the dataset (train or test), but since the user hasn\'t specified, but the ask_eda tool will handle it.\n\nWait, in the previous call, the user asked for training data. For test, they need to specify test.csv.\n\nSo in the question, to ask about test.csv\'s context distribution.\n\nSo next tool call: "What is the distribution of context codes in test.csv? Show the top 10 most frequent contexts and their counts."\n\nAlso, how many rows in test?\n\nBut perhaps also check if test has same columns.\n\nBut the user said test.csv is provided in the data, so need to check test.csv\'s data.\n\nNow, given all that, to proceed.\n\nAnother thing: check the count of rows in test. The competition description says "approximately 12k", so check if real count is close.\n\nBut since there\'s a public test set (but the hidden test set is larger), but perhaps the public test.csv is part of the visible data.\n\nAssuming that when they open the competition, they get train.csv, test.csv, sample_submission.csv.\n\nSo test.csv size: the public test set is small, but perhaps it\'s 12k or less.\n\nBut regardless, for EDA, check the size.\n\nBut for now, the next question is test context.\n\nBut let\'s see.\n\nAfter previous calls:\n\n- Train scores and missing.\n\n- Context in train.\n\nNow, next:\n\n- Check test.csv context.\n\nSo let\'s do that.\n\nBut also, check if the data has any anchor/target variations. Wait, maybe also check if the same anchor appears across different contexts.\n\nBut for now, proceed step by step.\n\nSo first, check test context distribution.\n\nNext, check the length of anchor and target for both train and test.\n\nBut the current tool call can be for test\'s context.\n\nSo:\n\nNext tool call: "What is the distribution of context codes in test.csv? Show the top 10 most frequent contexts and their counts."\n\nAlso, how many rows in test.csv.\n\nBut the question should be precise. For example: "What are the top 10 most frequent context codes in test.csv and their counts?"\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: check how many rows in test.csv.\n\nSo maybe another question: "How many rows are in test.csv?"\n\nBut maybe it\'s better to assume that the competition host expects to query the actual files.\n\nBut the tool can answer these.\n\nAlternatively, for context in test, files can be checked.\n\nBut proceeding.\n', 'reasoning_details': [{'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'Okay, let\'s see what we have so far.

But if they have different scores, that\'s a data quality issue.\n\nSo maybe check for duplicate (anchor, target, context) triples with differing scores.\n\nBut first, check the number of unique anchors, targets.\n\nLet\'s proceed with that.\n\nNow, for the next tool call: maybe ask about anchor and target lengths.\n\nOr check unique anchors and targets.\n\nAlternatively, check the uniqueness of the triplets.\n\nSo possible next questions: "What is the average character length of anchor and target phrases in the training set?" and "What is the distribution of character counts for anchor and target?"\n\nAlso, "How many unique anchor and target values are in the training data?"\n\nAlso, "How many duplicate entries exist where the same (anchor, target, context) triplet has different scores?"\n\nBut also, check the test.csv for context code counts compared to train.\n\nBut since the team might not have test data in memory, perhaps the ask_eda can query test.csv too.\n\nAlternatively, the initial call for training set, now check test set.\n\nLet\'s proceed.\n\nWait, the current state:\n\n- Train score distribution is known.\n\n- Missing values all zero.\n\n- Context code counts known for train.\n\nNow, perhaps check anchors and targets.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst, ask for the character length distribution of anchor and target in train.\n\nNext, compare test data.\n\nBut let\'s start with train.\n\nFor example:\n\n"How many unique anchor and target values are present in the training data?"\n\nBut also, the length statistics.\n\nLet me think of the question structure.\n\nFor example:\n\n"Show the character length distribution of anchor and target columns in the training data, including min, max, mean, and median."\n\nAlso, "What is the distribution of word counts for anchor and target?"\n\nBut maybe the team wants specific details.\n\nAlternatively, "How many unique anchor values and unique target values are there in the training data?"\n\nLet\'s do that.\n\nSo next tool call: "How many unique anchors and targets are in the training data?"\n\nThen check the length stats.\n\nBut also, maybe check the context distribution in test.csv.\n\nWait, the data has test.csv. So for the context codes in test, let\'s check how many and the top 10 same as train?\n\nIf context codes in test have different distribution, there could be a shift.\n\nSimilarly, for anchor and target lengths.\n\nSo perhaps next steps include checking test data\'s context codes and other attributes.\n\nSo for example, "How many unique context codes in test.csv?" and "Top 10 contexts in test."\n\nBut since the public test set is small but provided, but the actual competition test set is hidden, but for now, the data provided for EDA would include test.csv.\n\nSo the EDA tool can run on both train and test.\n\nSo let\'s check test\'s context codes.\n\nAlternatively, to check for train vs test distribution of context codes.\n\nSo first, get context counts for test.\n\nSo next tool call: "What is the distribution of context codes in test.csv? Show top 10."\n\nBut since the user needs to know both train and test to see shift.\n\nYes.\n\nAlso, check the number of rows in test.\n\nThe test set size is specified as approximately 12k pairs. But in the actual public test.csv, the size may be a portion of that. But regardless, the tool can check the size.\n\nBut given the team\'s prior steps, the next step is to check test\'s context code counts and compare with train.\n\nSo current state: after checking train\'s context top 10 (H04, H01, etc.), perhaps the test\'s context distribution may be similar or different.\n\nSo next steps:\n\nCheck test\'s context distribution.\n\nCheck train/test for anchor/target uniqueness or length.\n\nCheck duplicates in train.\n\nSo let\'s proceed.\n\nFirst, how many unique anchors in train?\n\nSo next question: "How many unique anchor and target values exist in the training data?"\n\nThen, "What are the top 10 most common anchor values and their counts?"\n\nBut maybe also check if the top anchors are context-dependent.\n\nBut perhaps start simple.\n\nAnother thing: perhaps the anchor and target have a lot of unique values, which suggests that they\'re diverse, which may make it harder for the model unless it\'s transfer learning on good embeddings.\n\nBut for now, proceed with the tool calls.\n\nSo, for context in test: "What is the distribution of context codes in the test set? Show the top 10 most frequent contexts and their counts."\n\nAlso, for anchor and target in train.\n\nWait, the tools are called with ask_eda questions.\n\nSo first, check unique anchors and targets in train.\n\nAsk: "How many unique anchor and target values are there in the training data?"\n\nNext, check the top anchor values.\n\nBut let\'s see. The previous answers were about training data only. Now the next step.\n\nWait, maybe also check the context codes in the test set to compare with train.\n\nSo let\'s do that next.\n\nSo the next tool call would be:\n\n"Show context code counts in test dataset, top 10."\n\nBut maybe more generally to check the number of unique contexts in test, and see if they match train\'s distribution.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n"Display context code counts in test.csv\'s context column."\n\nBut since the tool can\'t see which file, but in Kaggle competitions, the train.csv and test.csv are in the same directory, so the ask_eda function can query against them.\n\nSo the question should specify the dataset (train or test), but since the user hasn\'t specified, but the ask_eda tool will handle it.\n\nWait, in the previous call, the user asked for training data. For test, they need to specify test.csv.\n\nSo in the question, to ask about test.csv\'s context distribution.\n\nSo next tool call: "What is the distribution of context codes in test.csv? Show the top 10 most frequent contexts and their counts."\n\nAlso, how many rows in test?\n\nBut perhaps also check if test has same columns.\n\nBut the user said test.csv is provided in the data, so need to check test.csv\'s data.\n\nNow, given all that, to proceed.\n\nAnother thing: check the count of rows in test. The competition description says "approximately 12k", so check if real count is close.\n\nBut since there\'s a public test set (but the hidden test set is larger), but perhaps the public test.csv is part of the visible data.\n\nAssuming that when they open the competition, they get train.csv, test.csv, sample_submission.csv.\n\nSo test.csv size: the public test set is small, but perhaps it\'s 12k or less.\n\nBut regardless, for EDA, check the size.\n\nBut for now, the next question is test context.\n\nBut let\'s see.\n\nAfter previous calls:\n\n- Train scores and missing.\n\n- Context in train.\n\nNow, next:\n\n- Check test.csv context.\n\nSo let\'s do that.\n\nBut also, check if the data has any anchor/target variations. Wait, maybe also check if the same anchor appears across different contexts.\n\nBut for now, proceed step by step.\n\nSo first, check test context distribution.\n\nNext, check the length of anchor and target for both train and test.\n\nBut the current tool call can be for test\'s context.\n\nSo:\n\nNext tool call: "What is the distribution of context codes in test.csv? Show the top 10 most frequent contexts and their counts."\n\nAlso, how many rows in test.csv.\n\nBut the question should be precise. For example: "What are the top 10 most frequent context codes in test.csv and their counts?"\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: check how many rows in test.csv.\n\nSo maybe another question: "How many rows are in test.csv?"\n\nBut maybe it\'s better to assume that the competition host expects to query the actual files.\n\nBut the tool can answer these.\n\nAlternatively, for context in test, files can be checked.\n\nBut proceeding.\n', 'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0}]}, {'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_1b9a19fcfb1e49d18feb862c', 'content': 'Top 10 most frequent context codes in test.csv:\n==================================================\nContext: H01 - Count: 230\nContext: H04 - Count: 215\nContext: G01 - Count: 179\nContext: A61 - Count: 165\nContext: F16 - Count: 121\nContext: C07 - Count: 115\nContext: G06 - Count: 99\nContext: B60 - Count: 94\nContext: G02 - Count: 89\nContext: H03 - Count: 83\n\nTotal number of unique contexts: 106\nTotal number of records in test set: 3648\n'}]

Here\'s your chance to do so.\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) offers one of the largest repositories of scientific, technical, and commercial information in the world through its\xa0[Open Data Portal](https://developer.uspto.gov/about-open-data). Patents are a form of\xa0[intellectual property](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/basics/general-information-patents)\xa0granted in exchange for the public disclosure of new and useful inventions. Because patents undergo an intensive\xa0[vetting process](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/InventionCon2020_Understanding_the_Patent_Examination_Process.pdf)\xa0prior to grant, and because the history of U.S. innovation spans over two centuries and 11 million patents, the U.S. patent archives stand as a rare combination of data volume, quality, and diversity.\n\n> "The USPTO serves an American innovation machine that never sleeps by granting patents, registering trademarks, and promoting intellectual property around the globe. The USPTO shares over 200 years\' worth of human ingenuity with the world, from lightbulbs to quantum computers. Combined with creativity from the data science community, USPTO datasets carry unbounded potential to empower AI and ML models that will benefit the progress of science and society at large."\n>\n> --- USPTO Chief Information Officer Jamie Holcombe\n\nIn this competition, you will train your models on a novel semantic similarity dataset to extract relevant information by matching key phrases in patent documents. Determining the semantic similarity between phrases is critically important during the patent search and examination process to determine if an invention has been described before. For example, if one invention claims "television set" and a prior publication describes "TV set", a model would ideally recognize these are the same and assist a patent attorney or examiner in retrieving relevant documents. This extends beyond paraphrase identification; if one invention claims a "strong material" and another uses "steel", that may also be a match. What counts as a "strong material" varies per domain (it may be steel in one domain and ripstop fabric in another, but you wouldn\'t want your parachute made of steel). We have included the Cooperative Patent Classification as the technical domain context as an additional feature to help you disambiguate these situations.\n\nCan you build a model to match phrases in order to extract contextual information, thereby helping the patent community connect the dots between millions of patent documents?\n\n> This is a Code Competition.

Kaggle. https://kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching\n\n\n# Data\n\n## Dataset Description\n\nIn this dataset, you are presented pairs of phrases (an\xa0`anchor`\xa0and a\xa0`target`\xa0phrase) and asked to rate how similar they are on a scale from 0 (not at all similar) to 1 (identical in meaning). This challenge differs from a standard semantic similarity task in that similarity has been scored here within a patent\'s\xa0`context`, specifically its\xa0[CPC classification (version 2021.05)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Patent_Classification), which indicates the subject to which the patent relates. For example, while the phrases "bird" and "Cape Cod" may have low semantic similarity in normal language, the likeness of their meaning is much closer if considered in the context of "house".\n\nThis is a code competition, in which you will submit code that will be run against an unseen test set. The unseen test set contains approximately 12k pairs of phrases. A small public test set has been provided for testing purposes, but is not used in scoring.\n\nInformation on the meaning of CPC codes may be found on the\xa0[USPTO website](https://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/cpc/html/cpc.html). The CPC version 2021.05 can be found on the\xa0[CPC archive website](https://www.cooperativepatentclassification.org/Archive).\n\n## Score meanings\n\nThe scores are in the 0-1 range with increments of 0.25 with the following meanings:\n\n- **1.0**\xa0- Very close match. This is typically an exact match except possibly for differences in conjugation, quantity (e.g. singular vs. plural), and addition or removal of stopwords (e.g. "the", "and", "or").\n- **0.75**\xa0- Close synonym, e.g. "mobile phone" vs. "cellphone". This also includes abbreviations, e.g. "TCP" -> "transmission control protocol".\n- **0.5**\xa0- Synonyms which don\'t have the same meaning (same function, same properties). This includes broad-narrow (hyponym) and narrow-broad (hypernym) matches.\n- **0.25**\xa0- Somewhat related, e.g. the two phrases are in the same high level domain but are not synonyms. This also includes antonyms.\n- **0.0**\xa0- Unrelated.\n\nFiles\n-----\n\n- **train.csv**\xa0- the training set, containing phrases, contexts, and their similarity scores\n- **test.csv**\xa0- the test set set, identical in structure to the training set but without the score\n- **sample_submission.csv**\xa0- a sample submission file in the correct format\n\nColumns\n-------\n\n- `id`\xa0- a unique identifier for a pair of phrases\n- `anchor`\xa0- the first phrase\n- `target`\xa0- the second phrase\n- `context`\xa0- the\xa0[CPC classification (version 2021.05)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Patent_Classification), which indicates the subject within which the similarity is to be scored\n- `score`\xa0- the similarity.

The task is to predict the similarity score between two phrases (anchor and target) in the context of a CPC classification. The evaluation is Pearson correlation, so the model needs to predict continuous scores between 0 and 1 with increments of 0.25.\n\nFirst, I need to clarify the target variable and features. The target is \'score\', which is a float between 0 and 1 in 0.25 increments. Features are \'anchor\', \'target\', \'context\' (CPC code), and \'id\' as unique identifier.\n\nBefore jumping into modeling, I should check the dataset structure and data quality. Let\'s start by getting a basic overview.\n\nHypothesis 1: The training dataset has a certain number of rows. Let\'s check the size of train.csv. How many samples are there?\n\nAlso, check for missing values in each column. If there are missing values, we need to handle them.\n\nNext, check the distribution of the \'score\' column. Is it balanced? Are there more samples at certain scores? Since the scores are in 0.25 increments, maybe some scores are more common than others.\n\nCheck the uniqueness of \'id\' to ensure there are no duplicates. Each id should be unique for a pair.\n\nLooking at the \'context\' column: it\'s a CPC code. Need to see how many unique CPC codes are there. Also, are these codes consistent in format? For example, are they always starting with a letter followed by numbers?\n\nAnchor and target text: check the average length, maximum, minimum. Also, check if there are any unusual characters or punctuation issues.\n\nCheck for potential leakage. For instance, if the same \'id\' appears twice with different scores, that\'s a problem. Also, check if same pairs (anchor and target) with same context have different scores, which would indicate inconsistency in labeling.\n\nCheck train vs test distribution for scores. But since test data isn\'t available until submission phase, maybe check if the sample_submission shows structure but not the actual scores. Wait, the user said "a small public test set has been provided for testing purposes", but the actual test set is unseen. However, for EDA, we can look at train.csv and maybe the public test set provided. Wait, the data description says "test.csv" is provided but without the score, and sample_submission. So the train.csv is available, maybe public test is also available to check distributions.\n\nBut for the initial step, we can only access train.csv for EDA. Let me check: the files listed are train.csv, test.csv, sample_submission.csv. So when running ask_eda, the dataset is available.\n\nBut as a lead researcher, I need to check the train data first.\n\nSo first step: get number of rows in train.csv and check for missing values per column.\n\nHypothesis 1: The dataset has around 50k rows (not sure exact, but likely a few tens of thousands). Let\'s check the size.\n\nAlso, check if \'score\' has any missing values.\n\nHypothesis 2: The \'context\' column has CPC codes like \'A01B\', \'B23K\', etc. Let\'s check the unique CPC codes and their structure.\n\nAnother hypothesis: The anchor and target lengths vary. Maybe check the distribution of their lengths.\n\nAlso, check if there are any duplicates in anchor-target pairs with same context. If so, do they have the same score? If not, that\'s a data inconsistency issue.\n\nLet\'s start by asking these questions via ask_eda tool.\n\nFirst, let\'s check the size, missing values, score distribution.\n\nSo for the first tool call: question: "What is the shape of the train.csv dataset? How many rows and columns? Check if there are any missing values in each column. Also, provide a summary of the score column including min, max, mean, median, unique values, and value counts."\n\nThat should give first insights.\n\nThen, based on that, next steps.\n\nWait, also check the unique values in \'context\'.\n\nAnother check: for anchor and target, maybe the languages used?

Also, get the number of unique contexts and the distribution of context codes."\n\nBut maybe better to break into separate questions? But the question can be a list.\n\nWait, the tool can handle a question that asks multiple things.\n\nAlternatively, do each step one at a time to avoid overwhelming the EDA tool.\n\nBut for efficiency, maybe a concise question.\n\nFor example: "Provide statistics on train.csv: number of rows, columns, missing values per column, score metrics (min, max, mean, median, value counts), number of unique contexts, and sample of context values."\n\nYes.\n\nSo first ask_eda for that.\n\nThen, based on the results, proceed.\n', 'reasoning_details': [{'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'Okay, let\'s start by understanding the competition. The task is to predict the similarity score between two phrases (anchor and target) in the context of a CPC classification. The evaluation is Pearson correlation, so the model needs to predict continuous scores between 0 and 1 with increments of 0.25.\n\nFirst, I need to clarify the target variable and features. The target is \'score\', which is a float between 0 and 1 in 0.25 increments. Features are \'anchor\', \'target\', \'context\' (CPC code), and \'id\' as unique identifier.\n\nBefore jumping into modeling, I should check the dataset structure and data quality. Let\'s start by getting a basic overview.\n\nHypothesis 1: The training dataset has a certain number of rows. Let\'s check the size of train.csv. How many samples are there?\n\nAlso, check for missing values in each column. If there are missing values, we need to handle them.\n\nNext, check the distribution of the \'score\' column. Is it balanced? Are there more samples at certain scores? Since the scores are in 0.25 increments, maybe some scores are more common than others.\n\nCheck the uniqueness of \'id\' to ensure there are no duplicates. Each id should be unique for a pair.\n\nLooking at the \'context\' column: it\'s a CPC code. Need to see how many unique CPC codes are there. Also, are these codes consistent in format? For example, are they always starting with a letter followed by numbers?\n\nAnchor and target text: check the average length, maximum, minimum. Also, check if there are any unusual characters or punctuation issues.\n\nCheck for potential leakage. For instance, if the same \'id\' appears twice with different scores, that\'s a problem. Also, check if same pairs (anchor and target) with same context have different scores, which would indicate inconsistency in labeling.\n\nCheck train vs test distribution for scores. But since test data isn\'t available until submission phase, maybe check if the sample_submission shows structure but not the actual scores. Wait, the user said "a small public test set has been provided for testing purposes", but the actual test set is unseen. However, for EDA, we can look at train.csv and maybe the public test set provided. Wait, the data description says "test.csv" is provided but without the score, and sample_submission. So the train.csv is available, maybe public test is also available to check distributions.\n\nBut for the initial step, we can only access train.csv for EDA.

Here\'s your chance to do so.\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) offers one of the largest repositories of scientific, technical, and commercial information in the world through its\xa0[Open Data Portal](https://developer.uspto.gov/about-open-data). Patents are a form of\xa0[intellectual property](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/basics/general-information-patents)\xa0granted in exchange for the public disclosure of new and useful inventions. Because patents undergo an intensive\xa0[vetting process](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/InventionCon2020_Understanding_the_Patent_Examination_Process.pdf)\xa0prior to grant, and because the history of U.S. innovation spans over two centuries and 11 million patents, the U.S. patent archives stand as a rare combination of data volume, quality, and diversity.\n\n> "The USPTO serves an American innovation machine that never sleeps by granting patents, registering trademarks, and promoting intellectual property around the globe. The USPTO shares over 200 years\' worth of human ingenuity with the world, from lightbulbs to quantum computers. Combined with creativity from the data science community, USPTO datasets carry unbounded potential to empower AI and ML models that will benefit the progress of science and society at large."\n>\n> --- USPTO Chief Information Officer Jamie Holcombe\n\nIn this competition, you will train your models on a novel semantic similarity dataset to extract relevant information by matching key phrases in patent documents. Determining the semantic similarity between phrases is critically important during the patent search and examination process to determine if an invention has been described before. For example, if one invention claims "television set" and a prior publication describes "TV set", a model would ideally recognize these are the same and assist a patent attorney or examiner in retrieving relevant documents. This extends beyond paraphrase identification; if one invention claims a "strong material" and another uses "steel", that may also be a match. What counts as a "strong material" varies per domain (it may be steel in one domain and ripstop fabric in another, but you wouldn\'t want your parachute made of steel). We have included the Cooperative Patent Classification as the technical domain context as an additional feature to help you disambiguate these situations.\n\nCan you build a model to match phrases in order to extract contextual information, thereby helping the patent community connect the dots between millions of patent documents?\n\n> This is a Code Competition.

This challenge differs from a standard semantic similarity task in that similarity has been scored here within a patent\'s\xa0`context`, specifically its\xa0[CPC classification (version 2021.05)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Patent_Classification), which indicates the subject to which the patent relates. For example, while the phrases "bird" and "Cape Cod" may have low semantic similarity in normal language, the likeness of their meaning is much closer if considered in the context of "house".\n\nThis is a code competition, in which you will submit code that will be run against an unseen test set. The unseen test set contains approximately 12k pairs of phrases. A small public test set has been provided for testing purposes, but is not used in scoring.\n\nInformation on the meaning of CPC codes may be found on the\xa0[USPTO website](https://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/cpc/html/cpc.html). The CPC version 2021.05 can be found on the\xa0[CPC archive website](https://www.cooperativepatentclassification.org/Archive).\n\n## Score meanings\n\nThe scores are in the 0-1 range with increments of 0.25 with the following meanings:\n\n- **1.0**\xa0- Very close match. This is typically an exact match except possibly for differences in conjugation, quantity (e.g. singular vs. plural), and addition or removal of stopwords (e.g. "the", "and", "or").\n- **0.75**\xa0- Close synonym, e.g. "mobile phone" vs. "cellphone". This also includes abbreviations, e.g. "TCP" -> "transmission control protocol".\n- **0.5**\xa0- Synonyms which don\'t have the same meaning (same function, same properties). This includes broad-narrow (hyponym) and narrow-broad (hypernym) matches.\n- **0.25**\xa0- Somewhat related, e.g. the two phrases are in the same high level domain but are not synonyms. This also includes antonyms.\n- **0.0**\xa0- Unrelated.\n\nFiles\n-----\n\n- **train.csv**\xa0- the training set, containing phrases, contexts, and their similarity scores\n- **test.csv**\xa0- the test set set, identical in structure to the training set but without the score\n- **sample_submission.csv**\xa0- a sample submission file in the correct format\n\nColumns\n-------\n\n- `id`\xa0- a unique identifier for a pair of phrases\n- `anchor`\xa0- the first phrase\n- `target`\xa0- the second phrase\n- `context`\xa0- the\xa0[CPC classification (version 2021.05)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Patent_Classification), which indicates the subject within which the similarity is to be scored\n- `score`\xa0- the similarity.

The competition is about predicting the semantic similarity score between two phrases (anchor and target) within a specific CPC context. The evaluation metric is Pearson correlation. So first, I need to figure out the dataset structure, check data quality, distributions, and any potential issues.\n\nFirst step: clarify the target variable, features, and evaluation metric. The target is the \'score\' column, which ranges from 0 to 1 in 0.25 increments. Features are anchor, target, context (CPC code), and id. The evaluation is Pearson correlation between predictions and actual scores.\n\nNext, check the dataset size and columns. Let\'s ask the EDA tool about the basic structure. What\'s the number of rows in train.csv? Are there any missing values in critical columns like anchor, target, context, or score?\n\nPossible hypotheses:\n\n1. The dataset has missing values in some columns.\n2. The \'score\' distribution is imbalanced.\n3. The \'context\' CPC codes have varying frequencies; maybe some are very rare.\n4. The anchor and target text lengths might vary, possibly correlated with scores.\n5. The CPC codes need to be mapped to their descriptions, so maybe check if the context codes are present in the external dataset that provides CPC titles.\n\nWait, the competition data description mentions that CPC classification version 2021.05 is used, and the description says that the context is a CPC code (like "A61K" or "B60K"). So, to get the full meaning of the CPC context, we might need external data. The support baseline notes mention "Extract CPC context text from external files using regex patterns and map them to the train and test datasets based on context codes." So probably, there\'s a separate dataset with CPC codes and their descriptions. Since the provided dataset has \'context\' as CPC codes (e.g., "G06F"), but the actual title (like "Electric digital data processing") is needed for better modeling. So maybe we should search for external datasets that have CPC code descriptions.\n\nSo first, use search_external_datasets to look for CPC title datasets. The query could be "CPC 2021.05 classification title mapping" or "USPTO CPC code descriptions". The support baseline mentions "Merge test dataframe with CPC titles using the \'context\' column to enrich context with corresponding titles" and "Map CPC context codes to their corresponding text descriptions using a preloaded dictionary." So yes, external data is required here. So I should run search_external_datasets for that.\n\nThen, run ask_eda to check the train.csv structure first. Let\'s check the columns, missing values, and sample data.\n\nNext step: after checking if there\'s external data, check the data in train.csv.\n\nLet\'s start with the basic EDA questions. Let\'s ask for the number of rows, columns, missing values, score distribution, and context unique values.\n\nFirst, call ask_eda with "How many rows and columns are in the train dataset? What are the column names? Any missing values?"\n\nThen check score distribution: "What is the distribution of the \'score\' column? Are all values in 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 increments? How many unique values?"\n\nCheck context: "How many unique context (CPC codes) are there in train? What\'s the top 5 most frequent context codes? Are there any context codes not present in the external CPC descriptions?"\n\nAlso check anchor and target text: "What\'s the average, min, max length of anchor and target phrases? Any non-ASCII characters?"\n\nAlso check for data leakage: "Is there any overlap between train and test sets? Check if anchor or target phrases appear in both sets? Or any cross-correlation between train and test?"\n\nWait, but the competition says the test set is separate with ~12k pairs. But need to check if train and test have overlapping phrases.\n\nSo first step: search for external CPC dataset. Because without the CPC titles, having just the codes might not be helpful. So maybe the external dataset is necessary.\n\nLet me first run search_external_datasets for CPC titles.\n\nQuery: "USPTO CPC 2021.05 classification descriptions"\n\nThen, after getting that, check if the context codes in train.csv have corresponding titles.\n\nBut before that, let\'s check the basic structure of the train data.\n\nSo first, ask the EDA tool about the basic train dataset stats.\n', 'reasoning_details': [{'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'Okay, let\'s start by understanding the problem. The competition is about predicting the semantic similarity score between two phrases (anchor and target) within a specific CPC context. The evaluation metric is Pearson correlation. So first, I need to figure out the dataset structure, check data quality, distributions, and any potential issues.\n\nFirst step: clarify the target variable, features, and evaluation metric. The target is the \'score\' column, which ranges from 0 to 1 in 0.25 increments. Features are anchor, target, context (CPC code), and id. The evaluation is Pearson correlation between predictions and actual scores.\n\nNext, check the dataset size and columns. Let\'s ask the EDA tool about the basic structure. What\'s the number of rows in train.csv? Are there any missing values in critical columns like anchor, target, context, or score?\n\nPossible hypotheses:\n\n1. The dataset has missing values in some columns.\n2. The \'score\' distribution is imbalanced.\n3. The \'context\' CPC codes have varying frequencies; maybe some are very rare.\n4. The anchor and target text lengths might vary, possibly correlated with scores.\n5. The CPC codes need to be mapped to their descriptions, so maybe check if the context codes are present in the external dataset that provides CPC titles.\n\nWait, the competition data description mentions that CPC classification version 2021.05 is used, and the description says that the context is a CPC code (like "A61K" or "B60K"). So, to get the full meaning of the CPC context, we might need external data. The support baseline notes mention "Extract CPC context text from external files using regex patterns and map them to the train and test datasets based on context codes." So probably, there\'s a separate dataset with CPC codes and their descriptions. Since the provided dataset has \'context\' as CPC codes (e.g., "G06F"), but the actual title (like "Electric digital data processing") is needed for better modeling. So maybe we should search for external datasets that have CPC code descriptions.\n\nSo first, use search_external_datasets to look for CPC title datasets. The query could be "CPC 2021.05 classification title mapping" or "USPTO CPC code descriptions". The support baseline mentions "Merge test dataframe with CPC titles using the \'context\' column to enrich context with corresponding titles" and "Map CPC context codes to their corresponding text descriptions using a preloaded dictionary." So yes, external data is required here. So I should run search_external_datasets for that.\n\nThen, run ask_eda to check the train.csv structure first. Let\'s check the columns, missing values, and sample data.\n\nNext step: after checking if there\'s external data, check the data in train.csv.\n\nLet\'s start with the basic EDA questions. Let\'s ask for the number of rows, columns, missing values, score distribution, and context unique values.\n\nFirst, call ask_eda with "How many rows and columns are in the train dataset? What are the column names? Any missing values?"\n\nThen check score distribution: "What is the distribution of the \'score\' column? Are all values in 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 increments? How many unique values?"\n\nCheck context: "How many unique context (CPC codes) are there in train? What\'s the top 5 most frequent context codes? Are there any context codes not present in the external CPC descriptions?"\n\nAlso check anchor and target text: "What\'s the average, min, max length of anchor and target phrases? Any non-ASCII characters?"\n\nAlso check for data leakage: "Is there any overlap between train and test sets? Check if anchor or target phrases appear in both sets? Or any cross-correlation between train and test?"\n\nWait, but the competition says the test set is separate with ~12k pairs. But need to check if train and test have overlapping phrases.\n\nSo first step: search for external CPC dataset. Because without the CPC titles, having just the codes might not be helpful. So maybe the external dataset is necessary.\n\nLet me first run search_external_datasets for CPC titles.\n\nQuery: "USPTO CPC 2021.05 classification descriptions"\n\nThen, after getting that, check if the context codes in train.csv have corresponding titles.\n\nBut before that, let\'s check the basic structure of the train data.\n\nSo first, ask the EDA tool about the basic train dataset stats.\n', 'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0}]}, {'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_1aaa0c597be2448fa659ba4f', 'content': "The train dataset has 32825 rows and 5 columns.\nThe column names are: ['id', 'anchor', 'target', 'context', 'score']\nMissing values per column:\n  id: 0\n  anchor: 0\n  target: 0\n  context: 0\n  score: 0\n\nDataset info:\n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 32825 entries, 0 to 32824\nData columns (total 5 columns):\n #   Column   Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------   --------------  -----  \n 0   id       32825 non-null  object \n 1   anchor   32825 non-null  object \n 2   target   32825 non-null  object \n 3   context  32825 non-null  object \n 4   score    32825 non-null  float64\ndtypes: float64(1), object(4)\nmemory usage: 1.3+ MB\nNone\n"}]

All columns are non-null, so no missing values. That\'s good. The score distribution shows counts for each score value: 0.0 (6774), 0.25 (10306), 0.5 (11068), 0.75 (3634), 1.0 (1043). So the scores are binned into 0.25 increments, with 0.5 being the most common, then 0.25, then 0.0, 0.75, and 1.0 the least. That\'s a somewhat balanced distribution but with 0.5 being the largest group. For the context, there are 106 unique codes. The top contexts are H04, H01, G01, etc. The words in anchor and target have an average of about 2.18 and 2.17 words, respectively, with low standard deviations, meaning most phrases are very short—typically 2 words. That makes sense for patent phrases; they\'re probably technical terms or short phrases.\n\nNow, the next step would be to check if there\'s any relationship between context and score. For example, maybe certain contexts have different score distributions. High scores might be more common in some contexts than others. Also, are there any potential data leaks? Since the competition mentions CPC codes, but the context column is a CPC code, perhaps the actual context text (the description of the CPC code) isn\'t included, but instead just the code. Wait, in the description, it says: "context - the CPC classification (version 2021.05), which indicates the subject within which the similarity is to be scored." So context is the code, like "H04" or "G06", but not the text description. However, the supporting baseline notes mention merging with CPC title codes, so maybe the external data needs to be pulled to get the actual text for each CPC code.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: "CPC codes may be found on the USPTO website... CPC version 2021.05 can be found on the CPC archive website." So the context in the dataset is the code, but to get the full description, we need external data. The supporting baseline notes also mention "Extract CPC context text from external files using regex patterns and map them to the train and test datasets based on context codes." So perhaps the external dataset for CPC titles is necessary. That would explain why in the baseline notes, they mention loading CPC title codes from external CSV files.\n\nSo maybe I should first check if we have access to the context descriptions. Since the current context is just codes (like H04), to map them to their actual text, we need the external dataset. So using search_external_datasets to look for "CPC classification titles 2021.05" perhaps. Let\'s do that.\n\nBut before that, let\'s think about possible leakage. Are there any cases where the target or anchor includes the context code in a way that could cause leakage? For example, if the context code is part of the anchor or target text, then the model could just look for the code and not learn the semantic similarity. But the context is a separate column, so maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the context code indicates a section, but if the anchor or target already includes the actual words of the context description, that might be a problem. But since context in the dataset is just the code (like H04), maybe the actual text isn\'t in the anchor or target. So maybe the context code is separate, and the description needs to be fetched.\n\nFor example, H04 might stand for "Electric communications," but the actual description would help the model understand the domain. So the training data\'s context column is the code, but we need to get the text descriptions to enrich the data.\n\nAlso, looking at the top contexts: H04 has 1962 rows. The top context codes.\n\nAnother point: the word count for anchor and target is very low. Average 2.1 words. So phrases are typically short, maybe technical terms. Like "cell phone", "global positioning system", etc. But need to confirm that.\n\nBut maybe there are some phrases that have more words? The standard deviation is low, but maybe some can be longer. The question is, for safety, check the min and max word counts for anchor and target. Or maybe check if some phrases contain special characters or numbers.\n\nAlso, how are the scores distributed per context? For example, some contexts may have more 1.0 scores, others more 0.25. If that\'s the case, then when building a model, it\'s important to account for the context as part of the feature. Also, if certain contexts have different score distributions, maybe stratified cross-validation based on context would be good.\n\nSo next steps: check score distribution per context to see if there\'s variation. Then check the actual CPC descriptions. Then check if anchor or target have common words across contexts. Also, check if there are unique contexts in train and test. Wait, since there\'s a test dataset, but we don\'t have access to it yet, but maybe in the competition description, it\'s mentioned that there\'s a public test set. But the initial data we have is train.csv. We need to check if context codes in test are similar to train to prevent distribution shifts.\n\nBut to check that, I need to look at the test data\'s context. Wait, maybe the test data is not provided when we\'re doing EDA. The competition description says that the test.csv is provided but without the score. So perhaps as part of the EDA steps, we need to check the test data as well. Let me check if I can get info on test.csv.\n\nWait, the initial tool calls were on train.csv. Let me do the same for test. But first, check the test dataset structure. Let\'s use ask_eda on test.csv first.\n\nSo next step: find out the structure of test.csv. How many rows, columns, etc.\n\nSo call ask_eda with "How many rows and columns are in test.csv? What are column names? Any missing values?" Then check context distribution in test.\n\nBut wait, the problem says "public test set has been provided for testing purposes, but is not used in scoring." So the test.csv might be small? The description says the unseen test set has approximately 12k pairs. But the public test set is perhaps the one provided for testing, but the actual test set for submissions is unseen and larger. However, the exact structure of public vs. hidden test might vary. But according to the problem, "a small public test set has been provided for testing purposes, but is not used in scoring." So perhaps the test.csv that\'s available to us in the competition files is the public test set. Let\'s check.\n\nSo first, check test.csv\'s structure. But the current tool call hasn\'t looked at test yet. Let me do that.\n\nNext tool call: ask_eda for test.csv structure.\n\nBut maybe also check for possible data leakage between train and test. For example, if a context code in test appears only in test and not in train, then the model might not have seen that context. But if context codes in test are subsets of train\'s, then okay.\n\nSo first, check test\'s structure. Let\'s proceed.\n\nLet me make the tool call for test.csv.\n', 'reasoning_details': [{'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'Okay, let\'s see.

Here\'s your chance to do so.\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) offers one of the largest repositories of scientific, technical, and commercial information in the world through its\xa0[Open Data Portal](https://developer.uspto.gov/about-open-data). Patents are a form of\xa0[intellectual property](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/basics/general-information-patents)\xa0granted in exchange for the public disclosure of new and useful inventions. Because patents undergo an intensive\xa0[vetting process](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/InventionCon2020_Understanding_the_Patent_Examination_Process.pdf)\xa0prior to grant, and because the history of U.S. innovation spans over two centuries and 11 million patents, the U.S. patent archives stand as a rare combination of data volume, quality, and diversity.\n\n> "The USPTO serves an American innovation machine that never sleeps by granting patents, registering trademarks, and promoting intellectual property around the globe. The USPTO shares over 200 years\' worth of human ingenuity with the world, from lightbulbs to quantum computers. Combined with creativity from the data science community, USPTO datasets carry unbounded potential to empower AI and ML models that will benefit the progress of science and society at large."\n>\n> --- USPTO Chief Information Officer Jamie Holcombe\n\nIn this competition, you will train your models on a novel semantic similarity dataset to extract relevant information by matching key phrases in patent documents. Determining the semantic similarity between phrases is critically important during the patent search and examination process to determine if an invention has been described before. For example, if one invention claims "television set" and a prior publication describes "TV set", a model would ideally recognize these are the same and assist a patent attorney or examiner in retrieving relevant documents. This extends beyond paraphrase identification; if one invention claims a "strong material" and another uses "steel", that may also be a match. What counts as a "strong material" varies per domain (it may be steel in one domain and ripstop fabric in another, but you wouldn\'t want your parachute made of steel). We have included the Cooperative Patent Classification as the technical domain context as an additional feature to help you disambiguate these situations.\n\nCan you build a model to match phrases in order to extract contextual information, thereby helping the patent community connect the dots between millions of patent documents?\n\n> This is a Code Competition.

Kaggle. https://kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching\n\n\n# Data\n\n## Dataset Description\n\nIn this dataset, you are presented pairs of phrases (an\xa0`anchor`\xa0and a\xa0`target`\xa0phrase) and asked to rate how similar they are on a scale from 0 (not at all similar) to 1 (identical in meaning). This challenge differs from a standard semantic similarity task in that similarity has been scored here within a patent\'s\xa0`context`, specifically its\xa0[CPC classification (version 2021.05)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Patent_Classification), which indicates the subject to which the patent relates. For example, while the phrases "bird" and "Cape Cod" may have low semantic similarity in normal language, the likeness of their meaning is much closer if considered in the context of "house".\n\nThis is a code competition, in which you will submit code that will be run against an unseen test set. The unseen test set contains approximately 12k pairs of phrases. A small public test set has been provided for testing purposes, but is not used in scoring.\n\nInformation on the meaning of CPC codes may be found on the\xa0[USPTO website](https://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/cpc/html/cpc.html). The CPC version 2021.05 can be found on the\xa0[CPC archive website](https://www.cooperativepatentclassification.org/Archive).\n\n## Score meanings\n\nThe scores are in the 0-1 range with increments of 0.25 with the following meanings:\n\n- **1.0**\xa0- Very close match. This is typically an exact match except possibly for differences in conjugation, quantity (e.g. singular vs. plural), and addition or removal of stopwords (e.g. "the", "and", "or").\n- **0.75**\xa0- Close synonym, e.g. "mobile phone" vs. "cellphone". This also includes abbreviations, e.g. "TCP" -> "transmission control protocol".\n- **0.5**\xa0- Synonyms which don\'t have the same meaning (same function, same properties). This includes broad-narrow (hyponym) and narrow-broad (hypernym) matches.\n- **0.25**\xa0- Somewhat related, e.g. the two phrases are in the same high level domain but are not synonyms. This also includes antonyms.\n- **0.0**\xa0- Unrelated.\n\nFiles\n-----\n\n- **train.csv**\xa0- the training set, containing phrases, contexts, and their similarity scores\n- **test.csv**\xa0- the test set set, identical in structure to the training set but without the score\n- **sample_submission.csv**\xa0- a sample submission file in the correct format\n\nColumns\n-------\n\n- `id`\xa0- a unique identifier for a pair of phrases\n- `anchor`\xa0- the first phrase\n- `target`\xa0- the second phrase\n- `context`\xa0- the\xa0[CPC classification (version 2021.05)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Patent_Classification), which indicates the subject within which the similarity is to be scored\n- `score`\xa0- the similarity. This is sourced from a combination of one or more manual expert ratings.\n\n> "Google Patent Phrase Similarity Dataset" by Google is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0)\n\nSupporting baseline notes:\n### Overall Approach\n- Fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for patents (anferico/bert-for-patents) to predict semantic similarity scores between patent phrases using a concatenation of context and anchor with target text as input.

Maybe average, max, min characters or tokens.\n\nAlso, check if the same \'anchor\' or \'target\' appears multiple times with different scores or contexts. Maybe some anchors have varying scores depending on context.\n\nAdditionally, maybe check if context codes have a certain structure. CPC codes are like class codes, perhaps starting with letters.

All columns have zero missing values. That\'s good—no missing data to handle initially. But I need to dig deeper.\n\nNext, I should check the target variable distribution. The evaluation metric is Pearson correlation, which measures linear correlation between predicted and actual scores. The scores are in 0.25 increments from 0 to 1.

What is the count for each score category?"\n\nAlternatively: "What are the counts for each unique score value in the train.csv dataset?"\n\nYes.\n\nThen, check cardinality of context: "What is the number of unique context values in train.csv, and the top 10 most frequent contexts with their counts?"\n\nAlso, check the anchor and target string lengths.

The user is leading a machine learning competition team for the USPTO patent phrase matching task. My role is to investigate the dataset thoroughly before making any modeling recommendations. So far, I\'ve checked the data shape and missing values, which are clean (no missing data). Then I looked at the score distribution.\n\nThe score distribution shows: 0.0 has 6,774, 0.25 has 10,306, 0.5 has 11,068, 0.75 has 3,634, and 1.0 has 1,043. So it\'s imbalanced. The majority are around 0.25 and 0.5, with fewer 0.75 and especially 1.0. The lowest score (0.0) is more than 0.75 but less than 0.25 and 0.5. That\'s important because if the model is trained on imbalanced data, it might not perform well on underrepresented classes, especially 0.75 and 1.0. But since the evaluation metric is Pearson correlation, which measures linear relationship, maybe the imbalance isn\'t a direct issue for the metric, but it could still affect how well the model captures the tail ends of the distribution.\n\nNext step is to check the structure of the input data. Let\'s see the anchor and target phrases. Maybe look at their lengths. How many words? Average, max, min? Also, how many unique contexts are there? The context is a CPC code. Let\'s check the cardinality of the context column. Also, check if there are duplicate rows. Wait, but the id is unique, so probably no duplicates, but maybe some anchor-target pairs with same context have multiple scores? But probably not, since id is unique.\n\nWait, the problem says the data is pairs of phrases with a context. So each row is a unique pair with same context. But maybe the same anchor and target with different contexts have different scores. Need to check context types.\n\nSo next question: "What are the unique values and counts for the \'context\' column?" to find how many different CPC codes there are and their frequencies. Also, maybe check the distribution of scores across different contexts to see if some contexts have certain scores more often.\n\nAnother thought: maybe check the length distributions of anchor and target. Let\'s ask for the character lengths and word counts for anchor and target.\n\nAlso, check if there are any patterns in the text. Like, do they have many numbers or special characters? But maybe better to first check the raw statistics.\n\nSo next steps: ask about context distribution, anchor and target text lengths (words and characters), maybe check if there\'s any consistency in the context codes (like whether they are hierarchical, like A, B, C sections). Also check for duplicates in anchor-target-context combinations. But since id is unique, probably not duplicates, but maybe same anchor and target with same context but different scores? But the problem states each row has a unique id, so maybe each pair is unique. But unlikely to have same anchor-target-context with different scores, but possible if manual ratings differ, but not sure.\n\nWait, the description says "each pair of phrases (an anchor and a target phrase)" with an id. So id is unique per pair. So no duplicates. So the unique combinations.\n\nBut perhaps some anchor phrases reappear many times, with different targets or contexts.\n\nSo next, to check: how many unique anchor phrases, unique target phrases, unique context codes. Also maybe check the number of unique contexts.\n\nLet me call ask_eda for context counts. Also check the length stats.\n\nWait, the current step after score distribution is to check the context column. Let\'s do that.\n\nBut also, maybe check for leakage between train and test. But the test.csv is separate, but we don\'t have access to test yet except for sample submission. The problem says the public test set is small. But for now, since the data is given as train and test, but the test.csv is not provided yet. Wait, the user is supposed to have the dataset locally. So maybe when using ask_eda, the tool can also check test.csv. But in the initial call, we only checked train. Maybe check if test.csv is available. But perhaps in this setup, the dataset is only provided as the CSV files. Let\'s see.\n\nBut the current instructions say "act as the lead researcher; don\'t write code but use tools to get data insights." So first, we need to verify the data structure. Let\'s check the context distribution.\n\nSo next tool call to ask_eda question: "what are the unique values and counts for the \'context\' column in train.csv?" and "what are the word length statistics (min, max, mean) for anchor and target columns?"\n\nWait, also, maybe check if the context codes follow the CPC structure, like first letter is section, then up to three digits, then a letter. For example, A01B. But perhaps the question about CPC structure is more external data related. The support baseline notes mentioned merging CPC titles, so the CPC codes need to be mapped to their text descriptions. The competition data says "context is CPC classification", so the codes like "A", "B", etc., but perhaps the specific codes have a hierarchy.\n\nBut to check that, maybe need external data. So the first thing is, the \'context\' column in train.csv has codes like "A", "B", etc., but those are the first part, and full CPC codes are longer. But how is it represented in the data? For example, maybe values like "A45D", "G06F" etc. So need to check what the context values actually look like.\n\nBut to answer that, we can run ask_eda on the context column\'s unique values and their counts. Let\'s see.\n\nAnother thing: Check if the CPC codes have any patterns. For example, are they all 4 characters? Maybe not. Let\'s see.\n\nSo possible step: check example context values. Or check the number of distinct contexts. But to know that, ask for the unique contexts and counts.\n\nWait, but the tool can be used to get the distribution of contexts. Also, possibly check the string lengths of context codes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check the actual values by looking at first few rows. Let\'s ask for a sample of context values.\n\nSo for example, first 5 unique context values.\n\nBut maybe better to get the unique contexts and their counts. Let\'s call the EDA tool with "What are the counts of each unique context value in train.csv?" Then also check a few examples.\n\nBut the previous step was score distribution; now moving to context analysis.\n\nSo next step: ask for context counts. That\'s important because if the context distribution is known, then maybe the CPC codes need to be handled properly.\n\nAlso, for the anchor and target text: their lengths. Let\'s check word counts and character counts. Because transformer models have max sequence length, so knowing the distribution helps to decide max length for tokenization.\n\nSo another tool call: "What are the average, max, and min word counts for anchor and target columns? Also, what are the character length stats for those columns?"\n\nSo the next step. But first, let\'s check context.\n\nLet\'s say the context column has many unique codes. For example, maybe 1000 or 10000 unique CPC codes. But need to check.\n\nAlternatively, if there are only a few hundred CPC codes, but many entries per context.\n\nSo let\'s make the next tool call to ask_eda for context distribution.\n\nSo far, done: shape, missing values, score distribution. Next: context counts and anchor/target lengths.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n', 'reasoning_details': [{'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'Okay, let\'s start breaking this down. The user is leading a machine learning competition team for the USPTO patent phrase matching task. My role is to investigate the dataset thoroughly before making any modeling recommendations. So far, I\'ve checked the data shape and missing values, which are clean (no missing data). Then I looked at the score distribution.\n\nThe score distribution shows: 0.0 has 6,774, 0.25 has 10,306, 0.5 has 11,068, 0.75 has 3,634, and 1.0 has 1,043. So it\'s imbalanced. The majority are around 0.25 and 0.5, with fewer 0.75 and especially 1.0. The lowest score (0.0) is more than 0.75 but less than 0.25 and 0.5. That\'s important because if the model is trained on imbalanced data, it might not perform well on underrepresented classes, especially 0.75 and 1.0. But since the evaluation metric is Pearson correlation, which measures linear relationship, maybe the imbalance isn\'t a direct issue for the metric, but it could still affect how well the model captures the tail ends of the distribution.\n\nNext step is to check the structure of the input data. Let\'s see the anchor and target phrases. Maybe look at their lengths. How many words? Average, max, min? Also, how many unique contexts are there? The context is a CPC code. Let\'s check the cardinality of the context column. Also, check if there are duplicate rows. Wait, but the id is unique, so probably no duplicates, but maybe some anchor-target pairs with same context have multiple scores? But probably not, since id is unique.\n\nWait, the problem says the data is pairs of phrases with a context. So each row is a unique pair with same context. But maybe the same anchor and target with different contexts have different scores. Need to check context types.\n\nSo next question: "What are the unique values and counts for the \'context\' column?" to find how many different CPC codes there are and their frequencies.

Here\'s your chance to do so.\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) offers one of the largest repositories of scientific, technical, and commercial information in the world through its\xa0[Open Data Portal](https://developer.uspto.gov/about-open-data). Patents are a form of\xa0[intellectual property](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/basics/general-information-patents)\xa0granted in exchange for the public disclosure of new and useful inventions. Because patents undergo an intensive\xa0[vetting process](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/InventionCon2020_Understanding_the_Patent_Examination_Process.pdf)\xa0prior to grant, and because the history of U.S. innovation spans over two centuries and 11 million patents, the U.S. patent archives stand as a rare combination of data volume, quality, and diversity.\n\n> "The USPTO serves an American innovation machine that never sleeps by granting patents, registering trademarks, and promoting intellectual property around the globe. The USPTO shares over 200 years\' worth of human ingenuity with the world, from lightbulbs to quantum computers. Combined with creativity from the data science community, USPTO datasets carry unbounded potential to empower AI and ML models that will benefit the progress of science and society at large."\n>\n> --- USPTO Chief Information Officer Jamie Holcombe\n\nIn this competition, you will train your models on a novel semantic similarity dataset to extract relevant information by matching key phrases in patent documents. Determining the semantic similarity between phrases is critically important during the patent search and examination process to determine if an invention has been described before. For example, if one invention claims "television set" and a prior publication describes "TV set", a model would ideally recognize these are the same and assist a patent attorney or examiner in retrieving relevant documents. This extends beyond paraphrase identification; if one invention claims a "strong material" and another uses "steel", that may also be a match. What counts as a "strong material" varies per domain (it may be steel in one domain and ripstop fabric in another, but you wouldn\'t want your parachute made of steel). We have included the Cooperative Patent Classification as the technical domain context as an additional feature to help you disambiguate these situations.\n\nCan you build a model to match phrases in order to extract contextual information, thereby helping the patent community connect the dots between millions of patent documents?\n\n> This is a Code Competition.

Kaggle. https://kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching\n\n\n# Data\n\n## Dataset Description\n\nIn this dataset, you are presented pairs of phrases (an\xa0`anchor`\xa0and a\xa0`target`\xa0phrase) and asked to rate how similar they are on a scale from 0 (not at all similar) to 1 (identical in meaning). This challenge differs from a standard semantic similarity task in that similarity has been scored here within a patent\'s\xa0`context`, specifically its\xa0[CPC classification (version 2021.05)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Patent_Classification), which indicates the subject to which the patent relates. For example, while the phrases "bird" and "Cape Cod" may have low semantic similarity in normal language, the likeness of their meaning is much closer if considered in the context of "house".\n\nThis is a code competition, in which you will submit code that will be run against an unseen test set. The unseen test set contains approximately 12k pairs of phrases. A small public test set has been provided for testing purposes, but is not used in scoring.\n\nInformation on the meaning of CPC codes may be found on the\xa0[USPTO website](https://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/cpc/html/cpc.html). The CPC version 2021.05 can be found on the\xa0[CPC archive website](https://www.cooperativepatentclassification.org/Archive).\n\n## Score meanings\n\nThe scores are in the 0-1 range with increments of 0.25 with the following meanings:\n\n- **1.0**\xa0- Very close match. This is typically an exact match except possibly for differences in conjugation, quantity (e.g. singular vs. plural), and addition or removal of stopwords (e.g. "the", "and", "or").\n- **0.75**\xa0- Close synonym, e.g. "mobile phone" vs. "cellphone". This also includes abbreviations, e.g. "TCP" -> "transmission control protocol".\n- **0.5**\xa0- Synonyms which don\'t have the same meaning (same function, same properties). This includes broad-narrow (hyponym) and narrow-broad (hypernym) matches.\n- **0.25**\xa0- Somewhat related, e.g. the two phrases are in the same high level domain but are not synonyms. This also includes antonyms.\n- **0.0**\xa0- Unrelated.\n\nFiles\n-----\n\n- **train.csv**\xa0- the training set, containing phrases, contexts, and their similarity scores\n- **test.csv**\xa0- the test set set, identical in structure to the training set but without the score\n- **sample_submission.csv**\xa0- a sample submission file in the correct format\n\nColumns\n-------\n\n- `id`\xa0- a unique identifier for a pair of phrases\n- `anchor`\xa0- the first phrase\n- `target`\xa0- the second phrase\n- `context`\xa0- the\xa0[CPC classification (version 2021.05)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Patent_Classification), which indicates the subject within which the similarity is to be scored\n- `score`\xa0- the similarity.

Here\'s your chance to do so.\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) offers one of the largest repositories of scientific, technical, and commercial information in the world through its\xa0[Open Data Portal](https://developer.uspto.gov/about-open-data). Patents are a form of\xa0[intellectual property](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/basics/general-information-patents)\xa0granted in exchange for the public disclosure of new and useful inventions. Because patents undergo an intensive\xa0[vetting process](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/InventionCon2020_Understanding_the_Patent_Examination_Process.pdf)\xa0prior to grant, and because the history of U.S. innovation spans over two centuries and 11 million patents, the U.S. patent archives stand as a rare combination of data volume, quality, and diversity.\n\n> "The USPTO serves an American innovation machine that never sleeps by granting patents, registering trademarks, and promoting intellectual property around the globe. The USPTO shares over 200 years\' worth of human ingenuity with the world, from lightbulbs to quantum computers. Combined with creativity from the data science community, USPTO datasets carry unbounded potential to empower AI and ML models that will benefit the progress of science and society at large."\n>\n> --- USPTO Chief Information Officer Jamie Holcombe\n\nIn this competition, you will train your models on a novel semantic similarity dataset to extract relevant information by matching key phrases in patent documents. Determining the semantic similarity between phrases is critically important during the patent search and examination process to determine if an invention has been described before. For example, if one invention claims "television set" and a prior publication describes "TV set", a model would ideally recognize these are the same and assist a patent attorney or examiner in retrieving relevant documents. This extends beyond paraphrase identification; if one invention claims a "strong material" and another uses "steel", that may also be a match. What counts as a "strong material" varies per domain (it may be steel in one domain and ripstop fabric in another, but you wouldn\'t want your parachute made of steel). We have included the Cooperative Patent Classification as the technical domain context as an additional feature to help you disambiguate these situations.\n\nCan you build a model to match phrases in order to extract contextual information, thereby helping the patent community connect the dots between millions of patent documents?\n\n> This is a Code Competition.

Kaggle. https://kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching\n\n\n# Data\n\n## Dataset Description\n\nIn this dataset, you are presented pairs of phrases (an\xa0`anchor`\xa0and a\xa0`target`\xa0phrase) and asked to rate how similar they are on a scale from 0 (not at all similar) to 1 (identical in meaning). This challenge differs from a standard semantic similarity task in that similarity has been scored here within a patent\'s\xa0`context`, specifically its\xa0[CPC classification (version 2021.05)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Patent_Classification), which indicates the subject to which the patent relates. For example, while the phrases "bird" and "Cape Cod" may have low semantic similarity in normal language, the likeness of their meaning is much closer if considered in the context of "house".\n\nThis is a code competition, in which you will submit code that will be run against an unseen test set. The unseen test set contains approximately 12k pairs of phrases. A small public test set has been provided for testing purposes, but is not used in scoring.\n\nInformation on the meaning of CPC codes may be found on the\xa0[USPTO website](https://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/cpc/html/cpc.html). The CPC version 2021.05 can be found on the\xa0[CPC archive website](https://www.cooperativepatentclassification.org/Archive).\n\n## Score meanings\n\nThe scores are in the 0-1 range with increments of 0.25 with the following meanings:\n\n- **1.0**\xa0- Very close match. This is typically an exact match except possibly for differences in conjugation, quantity (e.g. singular vs. plural), and addition or removal of stopwords (e.g. "the", "and", "or").\n- **0.75**\xa0- Close synonym, e.g. "mobile phone" vs. "cellphone". This also includes abbreviations, e.g. "TCP" -> "transmission control protocol".\n- **0.5**\xa0- Synonyms which don\'t have the same meaning (same function, same properties). This includes broad-narrow (hyponym) and narrow-broad (hypernym) matches.\n- **0.25**\xa0- Somewhat related, e.g. the two phrases are in the same high level domain but are not synonyms. This also includes antonyms.\n- **0.0**\xa0- Unrelated.\n\nFiles\n-----\n\n- **train.csv**\xa0- the training set, containing phrases, contexts, and their similarity scores\n- **test.csv**\xa0- the test set set, identical in structure to the training set but without the score\n- **sample_submission.csv**\xa0- a sample submission file in the correct format\n\nColumns\n-------\n\n- `id`\xa0- a unique identifier for a pair of phrases\n- `anchor`\xa0- the first phrase\n- `target`\xa0- the second phrase\n- `context`\xa0- the\xa0[CPC classification (version 2021.05)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Patent_Classification), which indicates the subject within which the similarity is to be scored\n- `score`\xa0- the similarity.

Let\'s start by understanding the competition description and the data provided.\n\nThe main goal is to predict the semantic similarity score between two phrases (anchor and target) given a context (CPC classification). The evaluation is Pearson correlation, which is important to note because it\'s a measure of linear correlation, so the model\'s predictions should be well-correlated with the actual scores.\n\nFirst, I should clarify the target variable, features, and data structure. The dataset has columns: id, anchor, target, context, and score. The context is CPC code, which is a classification system for patents. The task is to predict scores between 0 and 1 in 0.25 increments.\n\nStarting with basic data quality checks. Let\'s look at the training data first. The user provided train.csv, test.csv, and sample_submission.csv. The primary thing is to check the size, missing values, distribution of scores, and maybe the structure of the columns.\n\nHypothesis 1: The dataset has missing values in any of the columns, especially \'score\' for training data. But since it\'s training data, probably no missing scores, but maybe in other fields. Let\'s check for nulls in train.csv.\n\nHypothesis 2: The score distribution is balanced or skewed. Since the scores are in 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, but maybe some classes are overrepresented. For example, maybe most samples are around 0.5. This could affect the model\'s ability to learn the extremes.\n\nHypothesis 3: The uniqueness of anchor and target phrases. Are there many duplicates in anchor-target pairs? If so, maybe some id\'s have the same phrases but different scores? That might indicate some noise or inconsistency in labeling.\n\nHypothesis 4: The context (CPC codes) distribution. Maybe certain CPC codes are more prevalent than others, or maybe the context codes have a lot of unique values, which might affect how we handle them (e.g., some CPC codes may not appear in train but in test).\n\nHypothesis 5: Length of anchor and target phrases. Maybe the length affects the score, like shorter phrases being more similar? Or perhaps longer phrases have lower variability. Need to check average character/word counts.\n\nHypothesis 6: Checking for possible data leakage. For example, if anchor and target in training have identical phrases but different scores, that could be a issue. Or maybe the same phrase pair appears multiple times with same or different scores. But since it\'s a code competition, but the training data shouldn\'t have duplicates unless intentional.\n\nAlso, the context is a CPC code. The CPC codes are hierarchical, but in the data, they\'re given as strings like "A01B 3/00". Maybe the context codes have some structure. The problem statement mentions that the CPC context is important for disambiguating similarity. For example, "bird" and "Cape Cod" might be similar in the context of "house" but not generally. So perhaps the context needs to be processed. But maybe the context string is directly used, or maybe it\'s a code that needs to be expanded into text descriptions.\n\nWait, but the data description says "context" is the CPC classification (version 2021.05). The CPC codes themselves might need to be converted to their text descriptions. Looking at the supporting baseline notes: "Extract CPC context text from external files using regex patterns and map them to the train and test datasets based on context codes." So maybe the \'context\' in the provided data is just the code (like "A12", "B34", etc.) but to get the description, you need external data.\n\nSo perhaps to fully use the context, we need to get the CPC code descriptions. For example, CPC code "A01" corresponds to "Agriculture; Hunting; Trapping; Fishing". But in the train.csv and test.csv, the \'context\' column might have just the code (like "A01", "A06", etc.) but not the full description. So the baseline notes mention merging with CPC titles. That suggests that the external dataset for CPC codes is necessary.\n\nSo the first step is to download the external CPC code data. The USPTO website or CPC archive has the code-to-description mappings. Let\'s check the supporting baseline notes: "Merge test dataframe with CPC titles using the \'context\' column to enrich context with corresponding titles." So yes, we need to download external CPC titles CSV file which maps CPC codes to their descriptions.\n\nTherefore, first step: use download_external_datasets to get the CPC code descriptions.\n\nLet\'s call download_external_datasets with query="CPC code description mapping for version 2021.05".\n\nBut what is the exact source? The competition description says: "The CPC version 2021.05 can be found on the CPC archive website."\n\nCPC archive website: https://www.cooperativepatentclassification.org/Archive\n\nLooking at that, there\'s a download section for the classification data. They have a file called "CPCTitle.txt" or similar. But perhaps the CSV needed is one that maps CPC codes to their titles.\n\nFor example, common practice in such competitions is to have a CPC codes CSV where each code (like "A01B") has a title. For example, in the Kaggle competition page, maybe there\'s a note that the data includes CPC codes like "A01B 3/00", but the actual description is separate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the external dataset is available as a separate CSV file on the competition\'s data page. Let me check the competition\'s data section. But since I can\'t access the internet directly, but the task is to use the download_external_datasets tool.\n\nSo the appropriate query for download_external_datasets would be "cpc code description mapping for version 2021.05".\n\nAfter downloading, then check the contents using ask_eda.\n\nBut first, let\'s process the training data first to check the context codes. Wait, perhaps the \'context\' column in train.csv is a CPC code like "A01", "B23", etc. But to get the description, need the external data.\n\nBut first, I should check the existing training data for context codes. Let\'s ask the EDA tool about the train.csv.\n\nAsked questions:\n\n- Check for missing values in train.csv columns (anchor, target, context, score)\n- Check the distribution of the \'score\' column\n- Check the unique count of \'context\' codes in train.csv\n- Check the length (character and word count) distribution of anchor and target\n- Check for duplicate (anchor, target, context) pairs with different scores (which would indicate data inconsistencies)\n\nAlso, check the test.csv for possible data leakage or distribution shifts.\n\nBut let\'s start with the ask_eda for the first steps.\n\nFirst, the training data contains \'id\', \'anchor\', \'target\', \'context\', \'score\'. Let\'s check for nulls.\n\nSo I should run ask_eda with question about missing values in train.csv.\n\nNext, check score distribution.\n\nThen, unique contexts.\n\nThen, check duplicates.\n\nThen, compare train/test context codes to see if there\'s overlap.\n\nBut the tool will do the analysis.\n\nSo let\'s start with:\n\n1. ask_eda("How many missing values are in each column of train.csv?")\n\n2. ask_eda("What is the distribution of scores in train.csv? List counts per score value (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0) and check if there\'s any distribution skew")\n\n3. ask_eda("What\'s the number of unique context codes in train.csv? Show their top 10 most frequent codes and their counts.")\n\n4. ask_eda("What\'s the character length distribution (min, max, mean) of anchor and target phrases in train.csv. Also, check word count distribution (mean words per phrase).")\n\n5. ask_eda("How many duplicate entries exist where same anchor, target, context pair have different scores?")\n\n6. Now, if CPC descriptions are needed, download the external CPC data, then check what\'s available.\n\nWait, the download_external_datasets should be called first to get CPC codes.\n\nAlternatively, first check if the train.csv\'s context codes are something like "A01", and if so, but perhaps the CPC codes in train.csv are structured as 4-digit codes (like A01B) but maybe the description needs to be obtained.\n\nBut perhaps, without the external data, we can\'t fully understand the context. So need to download that first.\n\nSo let\'s call:\n\ndownload_external_datasets("CPC code title mapping for version 2021.05")\n\nThen, once downloaded, use ask_eda on that file.\n\nBut first, need to check if the training data\'s context column matches the codes in the external CPC dataset.\n\nWait, the competition\'s problem description says the CPC codes are version 2021.05. So the exact version is important.\n\nSo perhaps the external dataset for CPC titles is available. Standard practice is that the CPC codes are hierarchical: e.g., a code might be "A61K 45/00", but the title for that code is "Medicinal preparations for treatment of diseases of the skin."\n\nSo for example, an actual CPC code has multiple sections, classes, subclasses, etc. But the context in the data might just be the basic code.\n\nWait, the sample in the problem says "For example, while the phrases "bird" and "Cape Cod" may have low semantic similarity in normal language, the likeness of their meaning is much closer if considered in the context of "house". The context here is CPC, so for example, if the CPC context is for "house", then maybe the code is related to housing or architecture. But how is the CPC code represented in the data? For example, the context column in train.csv might have codes like "E04B" for building construction, which might relate to houses.\n\nSo to get the titles for the CPC codes used in the dataset, the external mapping is needed.\n\nSo first, download the external CPC code descriptions.\n\nSo now, calling:\n\ndownload_external_datasets("CPC title mapping for version 2021.05")\n\nAssuming the tool can fetch a CSV file that has CPC code (like "A01B") and title (like "Agriculture; Hunting; Trapping; Fishing").\n\nAlternatively, maybe the standard CPC code-to-title files are available. For example, here\'s a common file: the "cpc-title.txt" from CPC archive.\n\nLooking for "cpc-title-202105.txt" or similar. But the exact file may vary. But perhaps the tool can find it.\n\nOnce downloaded, we can check what\'s in that file.\n\nBut also, perhaps the train.csv\'s context column has full CPC codes. Let\'s say, for example, a context code in train.json is "A01B 3/00". But the CPC description may be linked to the main code "A01B" or to "A01B3/00". So need to check how the codes are structured.\n\nBut before that, first, check the current train data\'s context values.\n\nSo step by step:\n\n1. Run ask_eda for train.csv missing values.\n\n2. Check score distribution.\n\n3. Check context uniqueness and counts.\n\n4. Check phrase lengths.\n\n5. Check for duplicate pairs with different scores.\n\nThen, download CPC titles data.\n\n6. Ask EDA on the downloaded CPC file to see the structure.\n\nThen, check if all context codes in train can be matched to CPC titles.\n\nThen, see if there\'s context codes in test that aren\'t in train, etc.\n\nBut to start, let\'s proceed to the first ask_eda.\n\nLet me write the first tool call.\n', 'reasoning_details': [{'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'Okay, I need to kick off the investigation for this patent phrase similarity competition. Let\'s start by understanding the competition description and the data provided.\n\nThe main goal is to predict the semantic similarity score between two phrases (anchor and target) given a context (CPC classification). The evaluation is Pearson correlation, which is important to note because it\'s a measure of linear correlation, so the model\'s predictions should be well-correlated with the actual scores.\n\nFirst, I should clarify the target variable, features, and data structure. The dataset has columns: id, anchor, target, context, and score. The context is CPC code, which is a classification system for patents. The task is to predict scores between 0 and 1 in 0.25 increments.\n\nStarting with basic data quality checks. Let\'s look at the training data first. The user provided train.csv, test.csv, and sample_submission.csv. The primary thing is to check the size, missing values, distribution of scores, and maybe the structure of the columns.\n\nHypothesis 1: The dataset has missing values in any of the columns, especially \'score\' for training data. But since it\'s training data, probably no missing scores, but maybe in other fields. Let\'s check for nulls in train.csv.\n\nHypothesis 2: The score distribution is balanced or skewed. Since the scores are in 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, but maybe some classes are overrepresented. For example, maybe most samples are around 0.5. This could affect the model\'s ability to learn the extremes.\n\nHypothesis 3: The uniqueness of anchor and target phrases. Are there many duplicates in anchor-target pairs? If so, maybe some id\'s have the same phrases but different scores? That might indicate some noise or inconsistency in labeling.\n\nHypothesis 4: The context (CPC codes) distribution. Maybe certain CPC codes are more prevalent than others, or maybe the context codes have a lot of unique values, which might affect how we handle them (e.g., some CPC codes may not appear in train but in test).\n\nHypothesis 5: Length of anchor and target phrases. Maybe the length affects the score, like shorter phrases being more similar? Or perhaps longer phrases have lower variability. Need to check average character/word counts.\n\nHypothesis 6: Checking for possible data leakage. For example, if anchor and target in training have identical phrases but different scores, that could be a issue. Or maybe the same phrase pair appears multiple times with same or different scores. But since it\'s a code competition, but the training data shouldn\'t have duplicates unless intentional.\n\nAlso, the context is a CPC code. The CPC codes are hierarchical, but in the data, they\'re given as strings like "A01B 3/00". Maybe the context codes have some structure. The problem statement mentions that the CPC context is important for disambiguating similarity. For example, "bird" and "Cape Cod" might be similar in the context of "house" but not generally. So perhaps the context needs to be processed. But maybe the context string is directly used, or maybe it\'s a code that needs to be expanded into text descriptions.\n\nWait, but the data description says "context" is the CPC classification (version 2021.05). The CPC codes themselves might need to be converted to their text descriptions. Looking at the supporting baseline notes: "Extract CPC context text from external files using regex patterns and map them to the train and test datasets based on context codes." So maybe the \'context\' in the provided data is just the code (like "A12", "B34", etc.) but to get the description, you need external data.\n\nSo perhaps to fully use the context, we need to get the CPC code descriptions. For example, CPC code "A01" corresponds to "Agriculture; Hunting; Trapping; Fishing". But in the train.csv and test.csv, the \'context\' column might have just the code (like "A01", "A06", etc.) but not the full description. So the baseline notes mention merging with CPC titles. That suggests that the external dataset for CPC codes is necessary.\n\nSo the first step is to download the external CPC code data. The USPTO website or CPC archive has the code-to-description mappings. Let\'s check the supporting baseline notes: "Merge test dataframe with CPC titles using the \'context\' column to enrich context with corresponding titles." So yes, we need to download external CPC titles CSV file which maps CPC codes to their descriptions.\n\nTherefore, first step: use download_external_datasets to get the CPC code descriptions.\n\nLet\'s call download_external_datasets with query="CPC code description mapping for version 2021.05".\n\nBut what is the exact source? The competition description says: "The CPC version 2021.05 can be found on the CPC archive website."\n\nCPC archive website: https://www.cooperativepatentclassification.org/Archive\n\nLooking at that, there\'s a download section for the classification data. They have a file called "CPCTitle.txt" or similar. But perhaps the CSV needed is one that maps CPC codes to their titles.\n\nFor example, common practice in such competitions is to have a CPC codes CSV where each code (like "A01B") has a title. For example, in the Kaggle competition page, maybe there\'s a note that the data includes CPC codes like "A01B 3/00", but the actual description is separate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the external dataset is available as a separate CSV file on the competition\'s data page. Let me check the competition\'s data section. But since I can\'t access the internet directly, but the task is to use the download_external_datasets tool.\n\nSo the appropriate query for download_external_datasets would be "cpc code description mapping for version 2021.05".\n\nAfter downloading, then check the contents using ask_eda.\n\nBut first, let\'s process the training data first to check the context codes. Wait, perhaps the \'context\' column in train.csv is a CPC code like "A01", "B23", etc. But to get the description, need the external data.\n\nBut first, I should check the existing training data for context codes. Let\'s ask the EDA tool about the train.csv.\n\nAsked questions:\n\n- Check for missing values in train.csv columns (anchor, target, context, score)\n- Check the distribution of the \'score\' column\n- Check the unique count of \'context\' codes in train.csv\n- Check the length (character and word count) distribution of anchor and target\n- Check for duplicate (anchor, target, context) pairs with different scores (which would indicate data inconsistencies)\n\nAlso, check the test.csv for possible data leakage or distribution shifts.\n\nBut let\'s start with the ask_eda for the first steps.\n\nFirst, the training data contains \'id\', \'anchor\', \'target\', \'context\', \'score\'. Let\'s check for nulls.\n\nSo I should run ask_eda with question about missing values in train.csv.\n\nNext, check score distribution.\n\nThen, unique contexts.\n\nThen, check duplicates.\n\nThen, compare train/test context codes to see if there\'s overlap.\n\nBut the tool will do the analysis.\n\nSo let\'s start with:\n\n1. ask_eda("How many missing values are in each column of train.csv?")\n\n2. ask_eda("What is the distribution of scores in train.csv? List counts per score value (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0) and check if there\'s any distribution skew")\n\n3. ask_eda("What\'s the number of unique context codes in train.csv? Show their top 10 most frequent codes and their counts.")\n\n4. ask_eda("What\'s the character length distribution (min, max, mean) of anchor and target phrases in train.csv. Also, check word count distribution (mean words per phrase).")\n\n5. ask_eda("How many duplicate entries exist where same anchor, target, context pair have different scores?")\n\n6. Now, if CPC descriptions are needed, download the external CPC data, then check what\'s available.\n\nWait, the download_external_datasets should be called first to get CPC codes.\n\nAlternatively, first check if the train.csv\'s context codes are something like "A01", and if so, but perhaps the CPC codes in train.csv are structured as 4-digit codes (like A01B) but maybe the description needs to be obtained.\n\nBut perhaps, without the external data, we can\'t fully understand the context. So need to download that first.\n\nSo let\'s call:\n\ndownload_external_datasets("CPC code title mapping for version 2021.05")\n\nThen, once downloaded, use ask_eda on that file.\n\nBut first, need to check if the training data\'s context column matches the codes in the external CPC dataset.\n\nWait, the competition\'s problem description says the CPC codes are version 2021.05.

Determining the semantic similarity between phrases is critically important during the patent search and examination process to determine if an invention has been described before. For example, if one invention claims "television set" and a prior publication describes "TV set", a model would ideally recognize these are the same and assist a patent attorney or examiner in retrieving relevant documents. This extends beyond paraphrase identification; if one invention claims a "strong material" and another uses "steel", that may also be a match. What counts as a "strong material" varies per domain (it may be steel in one domain and ripstop fabric in another, but you wouldn\'t want your parachute made of steel). We have included the Cooperative Patent Classification as the technical domain context as an additional feature to help you disambiguate these situations.\n\nCan you build a model to match phrases in order to extract contextual information, thereby helping the patent community connect the dots between millions of patent documents?\n\n> This is a Code Competition.

Start by clarifying the target variable(s), feature space(s), and evaluation metric(s) from the competition description.\n2. Investigate label balance or distribution, missing values, feature ranges, and dataset size.\n3. Examine the structure of the input data (e.g., length distributions, numerical scales, categorical cardinalities, sequence lengths, or image dimensions).\n4. Probe for potential leakage, ordering effects (temporal, spatial, or otherwise), or train/test distribution shifts.\n5.

First, I need to understand the dataset structure and the task. The goal is to predict the similarity score between two phrases (anchor and target) given a context (CPC classification). The evaluation is Pearson correlation, so the model needs to output continuous values between 0 and 1.\n\nFirst step: Clarify the target variable, features, and evaluation metric. The target is \'score\' in the train.csv, with possible values in increments of 0.25 from 0 to 1. Features are \'anchor\', \'target\', \'context\', and the \'id\' is just an identifier. Evaluation is Pearson correlation between predicted and actual scores.\n\nNow, the primary task is to do EDA to understand the distribution, missing values, data quality, etc. So, start with the basic things.\n\nFirst, check the dataset size and columns in train.csv. How many samples? What\'s the distribution of scores? Are there missing values in the columns?\n\nLet me ask the EDA tool for the column info and basic stats.\n\nQuestion for ask_eda: What is the structure of the train.csv dataset? Include column names, data types, number of rows, and check for missing values.\n\nAlso, check the distribution of the \'score\' variable to see if it\'s balanced. The scores are in 0.25 increments, but maybe some scores are more common than others.\n\nOrthogonal: Check the \'context\' column. What\'s the unique CPC codes and their frequencies. Also, maybe check if context codes have text descriptions, but since the context is the CPC code (like \'A61K\'), maybe need to map it to the actual title. But the problem says "context is CPC classification (version 2021.05)", so maybe the context is a code that needs to be expanded with external data.\n\nWait, the competition description says: "The CPC version 2021.05 can be found on the CPC archive website." There might be a mapping from CPC code to its title. So, for example, \'A61K\' might correspond to "Medicinal preparations". So the context code itself might be too vague without knowing the title. So if the CPC code alone is used, maybe we need to get the external data for CPC codes with their titles. Hence, need to download external datasets related to CPC codes.\n\nBut first, check whether the context codes in the dataset are just the codes (like "A", "A61", "A61K", etc.), and maybe the actual descriptions are needed for better modeling. So perhaps the contexts in the dataset are codes, and to enrich them, we need to get the CPC titles.\n\nSo possible steps:\n\n1. Check the train.csv data. What are the values in the context column? How unique are they? Are the context codes in a format that needs to be mapped to descriptions?\n\nSo first step: Use ask_eda to check the distribution of context codes.\n\nAlso, check the anchor and target text length distributions. For example, how long are the phrases typically?\n\nLet me start by asking about the structure of train.csv.\n\nSo ask_eda: "What are the column names, data types, number of rows, and missing values in train.csv?"\n\nWait, but the competition data has train.csv, test.csv, and sample_submission. The user might have access to the train.csv data. But to check the details of the dataset.\n\nAlso, check if there are missing values in any columns. For example, do all rows have anchor, target, context? Are there missing values in score? But in train.csv, score is provided, so missing values there would be a problem, but likely not.\n\nAnother thing: Check the distribution of the \'score\' variable. How many of each score? Since scores are in 0.25 increments (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0), check how many samples for each.\n\nAlso, look at the context column: how many unique contexts, what are the most common ones.\n\nSimilarly, check the length of anchor and target strings. Get average, min, max, maybe distribution.\n\nSo first tool call would be to get info on the dataset structure, missing values, score distribution, context counts, anchor and target length stats.\n\nLet\'s do that.\n\nAfter getting that info, maybe check if there are any duplicate pairs (same anchor, target, context but different scores) which would indicate data errors.\n\nThen, also check how the context codes look. For example, if context codes are from a certain format. CPC codes usually have structure like A, A61, A61K, etc. But in the dataset, maybe the context is given as a string like "A", "A23", etc.\n\nBut to better model, we might need the CPC title.

So download the external datasets for CPC classification, perhaps from USPTO or the CPC archive.\n\nSo the next step would be to use download_external_datasets with query "CPC classification titles V2021.05" to get the mapping of CPC codes to their titles.\n\nThen, join that with the train and test data to enrich context with titles.\n\nBut let\'s wait for the initial EDA results.\n\nLet\'s start with the first ask_eda call.\n\nPossible tool call:\n\n{"name": "ask_eda", "arguments": {"question": "What are the column names, data types, number of rows, and missing values in train.csv?"}}\n\nBut maybe also ask about the score distribution, context, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the ask_eda can handle multiple questions in one call?

The user asked for EDA on the train.csv dataset, and here\'s the output.\n\nFirst, column names and data types: id (object), anchor (object), target (object), context (object), score (float64). All columns have 0 null counts, so no missing data. That\'s good. The row count is 32,825, which is a decent size for training.\n\nScore distribution: 0.00 (20.64%), 0.25 (31.40%), 0.50 (33.72%), 0.75 (11.07%), 1.00 (3.18%). So the labels are heavily skewed towards lower scores, especially 0.25 and 0.50. The 1.00 class is very rare (only ~3%). This might be a problem because if the model predicts mostly the majority classes, it might not handle the high or low extremes well, but since the evaluation is Pearson correlation, maybe the model needs to capture the real distribution. However, the skew could affect performance, especially for scores like 1.00 which are rare.\n\nContext unique values: top 10 contexts are H04, H01, G01, A61, F16, G06, C07, B60, B01, G02. Total unique contexts are 106. So there are several context codes, but the top ones are repeating a lot. For example, H04 appears 1962 times. The context codes are CPC classifications, so they correspond to technical domains. But wait, CPC codes can have multiple levels. For example, H04 is a main class, but maybe there are subclasses. But in the data, context is given as a string like "H04", which might be the main class. Need to check if the context string is just the main class or the full code. For example, CPC codes usually have a letter followed by numbers, like H04B for a subclass. But here, the top context entries are H04, H01, etc., which are the main classes, but maybe there are sub-classes. Wait, the problem description says "CPC classification (version 2021.05)", so the context might be the full code. Let me check the tool output again. The unique contexts are like "H04", "H01", but maybe there are more complex codes. Wait, the user\'s EDA says "Number of unique contexts: 106". So the context column contains primary CPC class codes? But maybe the actual context uses the full code. Let me see. For example, maybe context is "H04" but there are also "H04B", etc. However, the top 10 listed are H04, H01, etc., each with counts. So each context entry is a CPC code string, possibly multi-character. But the count here shows that "H04" is the most frequent with 1962 entries, but maybe there are more detailed codes like H04B, H04W, etc. The current EDA output only shows top 10 most frequent context values. So the data might have contexts that are like "H04", "H04B", "G06N", etc., but in the top 10, the main class codes like H04 (without subclass) are most frequent. But the output lists "H04" as a context value, but in reality, the actual CPC code might have more levels. Therefore, the context codes might be the full codes, but some are more common than others.\n\nAnchor average length is 15.99 characters, target 15.76. So the phrases are short, which makes sense for patent phrases. The number of unique anchors is 733, unique targets is 26,850. Wait, that\'s a big difference. Let me check that. If there are 32,825 rows, and only 733 unique anchors, but 26,850 unique targets, that means that anchors are reused a lot across different pairs. For example, the same anchor might be paired with many different targets. However, target is unique in 26,850 of 32k rows, which suggests that many targets are unique, but some might repeat. Wait, the count is unique values. So 733 unique anchors in the entire dataset. That\'s very few. Let me calculate: 32825 rows, 733 unique anchors, so on average each anchor is paired with about 44.8 targets (32825/733 ≈44.8). But unique targets are 26850, which is higher than the total rows (32825), wait no. Wait, 26850 unique targets in 32825 rows. That means that some targets are repeated. Wait, 26850 unique targets for 32825 rows implies that many targets are repeated. For example, the most frequent targets might be common. But 26850 unique targets out of 32825 rows means about 26.8% of targets are unique? No, wait: the number of unique targets is 26,850, which is less than 32,825. Because 26,850 is the count of unique strings. So, let\'s say there are 32,825 total entries for target column, but only 26,850 distinct ones. So some targets are repeated. Similarly, anchor has 733 unique out of 32825 rows, so each anchor is used many times. That makes sense. So specific anchor phrases are reused across different contexts. For example, "voltage" might be an anchor paired with many different targets in different contexts.\n\nNow, the next question: are there any potential issues? Let\'s see.\n\nFirst, the context codes. The top contexts are H04 (1962), H01 (1956), etc. But the total unique contexts are 106. So CPC codes are actually the main class codes (like H04, G06, etc.), maybe not the full CPC codes, but perhaps the first character and part of the numbers. Wait, CPC codes typically have a class (one letter) followed by numbers and sometimes another letter. For example, H04B is a subclass. But in the data, the top context values are like "H04", so maybe only the main class is used here. Alternatively, maybe it\'s the full code. Let\'s check the number of unique contexts. There are 106 unique context codes. Let\'s see: CPC has about 250 main classes (A to H, and Y), but maybe the dataset uses the main classes. But the count of 106 unique contexts suggests that the context column is not the main class but a more specific code. For example, a CPC code has a class (e.g., H), section (H04 is a subclass), but maybe here it\'s the full CPC code string. Let me check: for example, in CPC, "H04" is part of the code. Wait, actually the CPC is structured into sections (A-H, Y), then classes (like H01, H04), then subclasses, etc. So the main class is something like H04. So context values like "H04" are the class codes. So the context column has the CPC class codes. But why are there 106 unique contexts? Because there are 106 different class codes in the dataset. For example, H04, H01, G01, etc. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the remaining steps. The evaluation metric is Pearson correlation. So the model needs to map the input to a continuous score such that the predicted scores correlate well with true scores. The skew in scores: most are 0.25 and 0.50. The 1.00 is very rare. This might affect how the model is trained. For example, if the model always predicts 0.50, it might have a decent correlation, but the evaluation metric might be sensitive to errors on less frequent scores. So patching the class imbalance in training might be important, perhaps through sampling or weighting. But since it\'s regression, Pearson correlation isn\'t directly affected by class imbalance but by how well the continuous predictions match the true values across the distribution.\n\nNext, check for leakage. The data might have any potential leakage. For instance, if the same anchor or target appears in both train and test, but since the problem is about matching phrases within context, perhaps the test set has new contexts or phrases. Need to check if there\'s overlap between train and test\'s anchors, targets, or contexts. But the current tool was only on train.csv. So we need to check the test set as well. However, the test set is not provided for analysis here. Since this is a competition, the test set is hidden, but perhaps we can check for leakage by seeing if the train data has duplicates in the rows, or the anchor/target pairs. But maybe that\'s not needed yet.\n\nWait, let\'s look at the previous data: 733 unique anchors, 26850 unique targets. So maybe the same anchor appears multiple times with different targets. But for example, if a particular anchor is only in the train set, then the test set might have new anchors. Alternatively, maybe the anchor and target in test could overlap with train, which would be considered leakage if the same pair appears in train for scoring purposes. But given the problem description, since it\'s about matching phrases in the context of CPC codes, the same anchor-target pair with same context might have the same score. However, if the same anchor and target but different context are present, that could be valid.\n\nBut to check for leakage between train and test, we need to look at both datasets. However, current tool only has train.csv. So first, perhaps download the test.csv to see its structure. Wait, but according to the problem description, there\'s a public test set, but in Kaggle, the public test set is often provided, but sometimes the actual test set is hidden. But for this competition, the test.csv is provided as a public dataset, but the actual score is hidden.\n\nBut the user hasn\'t yet called for the test data. So possible steps: check the test.csv for similar structure, number of rows, null counts, etc. Then see if any anchor or target in test exists in train, or context overlap. But that\'s a standard leakage check. Also, check if the test set has similar score distribution (but test set doesn\'t have scores, so we can\'t check scores). But for leakage, we can check whether the same (anchor, target, context) exists in both train and test. If they do, that would be leakage. But usually in these competitions, they scrub for such cases.\n\nAnother thing: check distribution of context in test. If test has entirely new contexts not present in train, that could be a problem. But need to check.\n\nAlso, check if there are patterns in the data. For example, whether certain contexts have specific score distributions.\n\nSo next steps for EDA:\n\n1. Check the test.csv structure: row count, unique anchors, targets, contexts, similar to train. Also, confirm that the test data doesn\'t have \'score\' column.\n\nBut according to the problem description, test.csv doesn\'t have \'score\' column.\n\nBut we need to call ask_eda on the test.csv. However, the user hasn\'t done that yet. So perhaps next step is to check the test data structure and statistics to compare with train.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps first download the external CPC description dataset. The problem mentions that context is CPC code, and there\'s a link to the CPC archive. For example, the CPC codes have titles or descriptions. So, the CPC code like "H04" is probably a classification code for telecommunications, but the actual title might be useful. Wait, the data description says: "we have included the Cooperative Patent Classification as the technical domain context as an additional feature to help you disambiguate these situations." So perhaps the context code (like H04) is a code, but the actual title is available. The data doesn\'t have the title, just the code. So the developer might need to map the context code to its textual description.\n\nThere\'s an external dataset needed here. For example, the USPTO has CPC codes with descriptions. Let\'s check: perhaps download the CPC classification files, which have codes and their titles. For example, the CPC version 2021.05. This could be useful for enriching the data.\n\nSo next step: call download_external_datasets for "CPC classification tree for version 2021.05" or similar. Once downloaded, then analyze it with ask_eda to see how the CPC codes map to titles, to see if there\'s any missing codes in the dataset.\n\nAlso, check train.csv for unique contexts, and whether those contexts are present in the external CPC data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the CPC codes in context are only the top-level codes, but in reality, the CPC codes have sub-levels, so when the competition mentions context, it\'s the main class. But the external CPC dataset would have the full classification tree.\n\nThus, the next tool call should be to download the external CPC data.\n\nSo first, let\'s note: the context column contains CPC codes, which need to be expanded to their textual descriptions for better understanding of the domain. So downloading the CPC classification files is necessary.\n\nTherefore, the next step: call download_external_datasets with query "USPTO CPC classification 2021.05 files" or "CPC 2021_05 official descriptions" or similar.\n\nBut the name of the external dataset: perhaps there\'s a file on the USPTO Open Data Portal that contains the CPC title lists.\n\nFor example, according to the competition description: "Information on the meaning of CPC codes may be found on the USPTO website" and there\'s a link to CPC archive website. So maybe there\'s a CSV file with CPC codes and titles.\n\nLet\'s use download_external_datasets to get that.\n\nSo next tool call: query "USPTO CPC classification tree for 2021.05", or perhaps the exact name. Let\'s say "CPC classification codes and titles for version 2021.05".\n\nOnce that\'s downloaded, then analyze it to see what\'s inside.\n\nAlternatively, the CPC archive website might have a file named \'CPCT_202105.txt\' or similar. Let\'s see. The CPC archive website (https://www.cooperativepatentclassification.org/Archive) has the 2021.05 version. The public disclosure might include all CPC classes and subclass titles.\n\nUpon checking the CPC Archive website, there\'s a link to "CPC 2021.05 version" with a file like "cpc_scheme_202105.zip". Once extracted, there are files with the schema. For example, the file might be CPCScheme202105.txt, which has CPC codes and their names.\n\nSo for the purpose of this competition, the external dataset needed is the mapping from CPC code to title.\n\nSo downloading that is necessary.\n\nTherefore, next step: call download_external_datasets with query "CPC classification codes and titles for version 2021.05".\n\nAfter that, analyze that dataset to see how many codes are present, and correlate with the context codes in train.csv to see if all context codes in train have a title mapping.\n\nSo let\'s proceed with that.\n\nBut according to the competition details: "Merge test dataframe with CPC titles using the \'context\' column to enrich context with corresponding titles." (from supporting baseline notes). So the developer must have to map the context code to its title, which requires this external data.\n\nSo yes, this external dataset is crucial. So next step is to download it.\n\nSo the next tool call is:\n\n{"name": "download_external_datasets", "arguments": {"query": "CPC classification 2021.05 codes and titles from USPTO open data"}}\n', 'reasoning_details': [{'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'Okay, let me start by reviewing the tool response. The user asked for EDA on the train.csv dataset, and here\'s the output.\n\nFirst, column names and data types: id (object), anchor (object), target (object), context (object), score (float64). All columns have 0 null counts, so no missing data. That\'s good. The row count is 32,825, which is a decent size for training.\n\nScore distribution: 0.00 (20.64%), 0.25 (31.40%), 0.50 (33.72%), 0.75 (11.07%), 1.00 (3.18%). So the labels are heavily skewed towards lower scores, especially 0.25 and 0.50. The 1.00 class is very rare (only ~3%). This might be a problem because if the model predicts mostly the majority classes, it might not handle the high or low extremes well, but since the evaluation is Pearson correlation, maybe the model needs to capture the real distribution. However, the skew could affect performance, especially for scores like 1.00 which are rare.\n\nContext unique values: top 10 contexts are H04, H01, G01, A61, F16, G06, C07, B60, B01, G02. Total unique contexts are 106. So there are several context codes, but the top ones are repeating a lot. For example, H04 appears 1962 times. The context codes are CPC classifications, so they correspond to technical domains. But wait, CPC codes can have multiple levels. For example, H04 is a main class, but maybe there are subclasses. But in the data, context is given as a string like "H04", which might be the main class. Need to check if the context string is just the main class or the full code. For example, CPC codes usually have a letter followed by numbers, like H04B for a subclass. But here, the top context entries are H04, H01, etc., which are the main classes, but maybe there are sub-classes. Wait, the problem description says "CPC classification (version 2021.05)", so the context might be the full code. Let me check the tool output again. The unique contexts are like "H04", "H01", but maybe there are more complex codes. Wait, the user\'s EDA says "Number of unique contexts: 106". So the context column contains primary CPC class codes? But maybe the actual context uses the full code. Let me see. For example, maybe context is "H04" but there are also "H04B", etc. However, the top 10 listed are H04, H01, etc., each with counts. So each context entry is a CPC code string, possibly multi-character. But the count here shows that "H04" is the most frequent with 1962 entries, but maybe there are more detailed codes like H04B, H04W, etc. The current EDA output only shows top 10 most frequent context values. So the data might have contexts that are like "H04", "H04B", "G06N", etc., but in the top 10, the main class codes like H04 (without subclass) are most frequent. But the output lists "H04" as a context value, but in reality, the actual CPC code might have more levels. Therefore, the context codes might be the full codes, but some are more common than others.\n\nAnchor average length is 15.99 characters, target 15.76. So the phrases are short, which makes sense for patent phrases. The number of unique anchors is 733, unique targets is 26,850. Wait, that\'s a big difference. Let me check that. If there are 32,825 rows, and only 733 unique anchors, but 26,850 unique targets, that means that anchors are reused a lot across different pairs. For example, the same anchor might be paired with many different targets. However, target is unique in 26,850 of 32k rows, which suggests that many targets are unique, but some might repeat. Wait, the count is unique values. So 733 unique anchors in the entire dataset. That\'s very few. Let me calculate: 32825 rows, 733 unique anchors, so on average each anchor is paired with about 44.8 targets (32825/733 ≈44.8). But unique targets are 26850, which is higher than the total rows (32825), wait no. Wait, 26850 unique targets in 32825 rows. That means that some targets are repeated. Wait, 26850 unique targets for 32825 rows implies that many targets are repeated. For example, the most frequent targets might be common. But 26850 unique targets out of 32825 rows means about 26.8% of targets are unique? No, wait: the number of unique targets is 26,850, which is less than 32,825. Because 26,850 is the count of unique strings. So, let\'s say there are 32,825 total entries for target column, but only 26,850 distinct ones. So some targets are repeated. Similarly, anchor has 733 unique out of 32825 rows, so each anchor is used many times. That makes sense. So specific anchor phrases are reused across different contexts. For example, "voltage" might be an anchor paired with many different targets in different contexts.\n\nNow, the next question: are there any potential issues? Let\'s see.\n\nFirst, the context codes. The top contexts are H04 (1962), H01 (1956), etc. But the total unique contexts are 106. So CPC codes are actually the main class codes (like H04, G06, etc.), maybe not the full CPC codes, but perhaps the first character and part of the numbers. Wait, CPC codes typically have a class (one letter) followed by numbers and sometimes another letter. For example, H04B is a subclass. But in the data, the top context values are like "H04", so maybe only the main class is used here. Alternatively, maybe it\'s the full code. Let\'s check the number of unique contexts. There are 106 unique context codes. Let\'s see: CPC has about 250 main classes (A to H, and Y), but maybe the dataset uses the main classes. But the count of 106 unique contexts suggests that the context column is not the main class but a more specific code. For example, a CPC code has a class (e.g., H), section (H04 is a subclass), but maybe here it\'s the full CPC code string. Let me check: for example, in CPC, "H04" is part of the code. Wait, actually the CPC is structured into sections (A-H, Y), then classes (like H01, H04), then subclasses, etc. So the main class is something like H04. So context values like "H04" are the class codes. So the context column has the CPC class codes. But why are there 106 unique contexts? Because there are 106 different class codes in the dataset. For example, H04, H01, G01, etc. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the remaining steps. The evaluation metric is Pearson correlation. So the model needs to map the input to a continuous score such that the predicted scores correlate well with true scores. The skew in scores: most are 0.25 and 0.50. The 1.00 is very rare. This might affect how the model is trained. For example, if the model always predicts 0.50, it might have a decent correlation, but the evaluation metric might be sensitive to errors on less frequent scores. So patching the class imbalance in training might be important, perhaps through sampling or weighting. But since it\'s regression, Pearson correlation isn\'t directly affected by class imbalance but by how well the continuous predictions match the true values across the distribution.\n\nNext, check for leakage. The data might have any potential leakage. For instance, if the same anchor or target appears in both train and test, but since the problem is about matching phrases within context, perhaps the test set has new contexts or phrases. Need to check if there\'s overlap between train and test\'s anchors, targets, or contexts. But the current tool was only on train.csv. So we need to check the test set as well.

So the user has already run two tool calls. First, they used ask_eda on the train.csv to get some basic stats, then they downloaded external datasets related to CPC codes.\n\nFrom the first ask_eda, the main points are:\n- Train data has 32,825 rows, no nulls.\n- Score distribution: 0.0 (20.64%), 0.25 (31.4%), 0.5 (33.72%), 0.75 (11.07%), 1.0 (3.18%)\n- Top contexts: H04, H01, G01, etc., with H04 being the most frequent (1962 entries).\n- Anchor and target have average lengths of ~16 characters.\n- Unique anchors: 733, unique targets: 26,850, unique contexts: 106.\n\nThen they downloaded external datasets, and now there\'s a titles.csv file. The description says it\'s CPC titles. So the next step is probably to look into that titles.csv to understand the context codes better.\n\nThe context column in the training data has codes like H04, H01, etc. But those codes by themselves might not mean much without their titles. So the user needs to map the context codes to their actual descriptions to get more insight into what each context represents.\n\nSo the next question should be to check the titles.csv. Let\'s see what the columns are, how many rows, and maybe check how the CPC codes from the main data correspond to these titles.\n\nSo the next tool call would be to ask_eda about titles.csv. For example, "Show columns, row count, and sample rows of titles.csv". Then maybe check how many titles are there, and see if the context codes in train.csv match the codes in titles.csv.\n\nWait, the download external datasets query was "CPC classification 2021.05 codes and titles from USPTO open data", and it returned titles.csv and sampled-patent-titles.csv. So the titles.csv likely has the CPC codes and their full titles.\n\nSo now, the next step is to query titles.csv. Let\'s ask about the columns and sample data.\n\nAlso, check if the context codes in train.csv are present in titles.csv. Maybe there\'s a mismatch or some codes not covered.\n\nSo perhaps the next question is: "What are the columns and first 5 rows of titles.csv? Also, how many unique CPC codes are in titles.csv, and compare to the unique contexts in train.csv."\n\nWait, but the user has train.csv and the titles.csv. The context in train.csv is the CPC code. So the titles.csv probably has a code column and a title column.\n\nSo the ask_eda on titles.csv would help to see the structure.\n\nAlso, need to check if all the context codes in train.csv have a corresponding title in titles.csv. Any missing codes?\n\nBut the first step is to get the structure of titles.csv.\n\nSo next tool call: ask_eda with question about titles.csv columns, rows, sample data.\n\nAfter that, check if all context codes in train are in titles.\n\nBut maybe there\'s another dataset, like the sampled-patent-titles.csv. Let\'s see. The download_external_datasets returned titles.csv and sampled-patent-titles.csv. Maybe sampled is a subset? But probably titles.csv is the main one.\n\nSo the next step is to ask_eda on titles.csv. Let\'s check.\n\nPossible question: "Show columns, data types, number of rows, and a few sample rows of titles.csv. Also, check how many unique CPC codes are in titles.csv and compare to the 106 unique contexts in train.csv."\n\nBut wait, the question needs to be precise. Let\'s structure it.\n\nAlternatively, "Ask for columns, rows, sample rows in titles.csv, and check if all context codes from train.csv exist in titles.csv\'s code column."\n\nSo the question could be: "Check the columns and sample rows of titles.csv. Then, for the \'context\' column in train.csv, how many codes are missing in titles.csv? Also, show the top 10 context codes from train.csv matched to their titles from titles.csv."\n\nBut that\'s multiple questions. Maybe split into separate tool calls.\n\nBut the first step is to check the structure of titles.csv.\n\nLet me write that tool call.\n', 'reasoning_details': [{'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'Okay, let\'s see. So the user has already run two tool calls. First, they used ask_eda on the train.csv to get some basic stats, then they downloaded external datasets related to CPC codes.\n\nFrom the first ask_eda, the main points are:\n- Train data has 32,825 rows, no nulls.\n- Score distribution: 0.0 (20.64%), 0.25 (31.4%), 0.5 (33.72%), 0.75 (11.07%), 1.0 (3.18%)\n- Top contexts: H04, H01, G01, etc., with H04 being the most frequent (1962 entries).\n- Anchor and target have average lengths of ~16 characters.\n- Unique anchors: 733, unique targets: 26,850, unique contexts: 106.\n\nThen they downloaded external datasets, and now there\'s a titles.csv file. The description says it\'s CPC titles. So the next step is probably to look into that titles.csv to understand the context codes better.\n\nThe context column in the training data has codes like H04, H01, etc. But those codes by themselves might not mean much without their titles. So the user needs to map the context codes to their actual descriptions to get more insight into what each context represents.\n\nSo the next question should be to check the titles.csv. Let\'s see what the columns are, how many rows, and maybe check how the CPC codes from the main data correspond to these titles.\n\nSo the next tool call would be to ask_eda about titles.csv. For example, "Show columns, row count, and sample rows of titles.csv". Then maybe check how many titles are there, and see if the context codes in train.csv match the codes in titles.csv.\n\nWait, the download external datasets query was "CPC classification 2021.05 codes and titles from USPTO open data", and it returned titles.csv and sampled-patent-titles.csv. So the titles.csv likely has the CPC codes and their full titles.\n\nSo now, the next step is to query titles.csv. Let\'s ask about the columns and sample data.\n\nAlso, check if the context codes in train.csv are present in titles.csv. Maybe there\'s a mismatch or some codes not covered.\n\nSo perhaps the next question is: "What are the columns and first 5 rows of titles.csv? Also, how many unique CPC codes are in titles.csv, and compare to the unique contexts in train.csv."\n\nWait, but the user has train.csv and the titles.csv. The context in train.csv is the CPC code. So the titles.csv probably has a code column and a title column.\n\nSo the ask_eda on titles.csv would help to see the structure.\n\nAlso, need to check if all the context codes in train.csv have a corresponding title in titles.csv. Any missing codes?\n\nBut the first step is to get the structure of titles.csv.\n\nSo next tool call: ask_eda with question about titles.csv columns, rows, sample data.\n\nAfter that, check if all context codes in train are in titles.\n\nBut maybe there\'s another dataset, like the sampled-patent-titles.csv. Let\'s see. The download_external_datasets returned titles.csv and sampled-patent-titles.csv. Maybe sampled is a subset? But probably titles.csv is the main one.\n\nSo the next step is to ask_eda on titles.csv. Let\'s check.\n\nPossible question: "Show columns, data types, number of rows, and a few sample rows of titles.csv. Also, check how many unique CPC codes are in titles.csv and compare to the 106 unique contexts in train.csv."\n\nBut wait, the question needs to be precise. Let\'s structure it.\n\nAlternatively, "Ask for columns, rows, sample rows in titles.csv, and check if all context codes from train.csv exist in titles.csv\'s code column."\n\nSo the question could be: "Check the columns and sample rows of titles.csv. Then, for the \'context\' column in train.csv, how many codes are missing in titles.csv? Also, show the top 10 context codes from train.csv matched to their titles from titles.csv."\n\nBut that\'s multiple questions.

The user is the lead research strategist for a machine learning competition team, so I need to build a deep understanding of the dataset before recommending any modeling steps.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial `ask_eda` call results for the train.csv:\n\n- Column names and types: id (object), anchor (object), target (object), context (object), score (float64)\n- Total rows: 32825\n- No null values in any columns, which is good.\n- Score distribution: \n  - 0.00: 20.64%\n  - 0.25: 31.40%\n  - 0.50: 33.72%\n  - 0.75: 11.07%\n  - 1.00: 3.18%\n  So, the scores are somewhat imbalanced, with the middle classes (0.25, 0.50) being the most frequent, and 1.00 being the least. That\'s important for modeling because the model might need to handle class imbalance, maybe through weighted loss functions or stratified sampling.\n\n- Context unique values top 10: H04, H01, G01, etc. There are 106 unique contexts in total. The counts for top contexts are around 1900+ for H04 and H01. So contexts are not evenly distributed, some codes are more common than others.\n\n- Anchor and target average length: ~16 characters each. Also, number of unique anchors is 733 (very few), but unique targets is 26850. Wait, that seems odd. Wait, 733 unique anchors out of 32825 rows? So the same anchor is reused across many rows, but the targets vary a lot. Let\'s check the statistics again. The previous output said Number of unique anchors: 733, unique targets: 26850. So most anchors are repeated, while targets are mostly unique. For example, perhaps anchor "child seat" is used in many different contexts with different targets. So the anchor might have high reuse, but targets vary.\n\nWait, but wait: anchor has 733 unique values, but total rows is 32825. So average repetition of anchor is 32825 / 733 ≈ 45 times per anchor. That\'s high. Similarly, targets have 26850 unique values out of 32825 rows, so most targets are unique (only about 6k duplicate targets). So each target usually appears once, but anchors are reused often. So the dataset has anchor reuse where the same anchor is paired with different targets in different contexts.\n\nNow, the next step was downloading external datasets for CPC titles. The `download_external_datasets` query was for CPC 2021.05 codes and titles. After download, there\'s a new file called titles.csv. Then another `ask_eda` on titles.csv:\n\n- Columns: code, title, section, class, subclass, group, main_group.\n- 260k rows. But the CPC codes in titles.csv have 260476 unique codes. But in train.csv, unique contexts are 106. However, the check showed all contexts in train.csv are present in titles.csv.\n\nWait, the actual first 5 rows of titles.csv: for example, code \'A\' has title \'HUMAN NECESSITIES\', section A, etc. So the codes in titles.csv are hierarchical: A, A01, A01B, A01B1/00, etc. So the code column in titles.csv contains the full CPC codes at different levels. However, in train.csv\'s context column, the values are like "H04", "H01", etc. Looking at the sample: context is 2-digit letters followed by numbers? Wait, the top contexts in train.csv are H04, H01, G01, A61, F16, etc. So those are section + class? Looking at titles.csv: the first row code \'A\' is section, then \'A01\' is section + class? Let\'s see: code \'A01\' has title \'AGRICULTURE; FORESTRY; ANIMAL HUSBANDRY; HUNTI...\' and section \'A\'.\n\nWait, CPC codes have hierarchical structure. The section is one letter (e.g., A, B, C...), then class (two digits), subclass (one letter), group (two digits), main group (three digits). But in train.csv\'s context, the values are like H04, which is likely section H, class 04. Because in titles.csv, the code \'H04\' would be a code with a two-digit class following section H. But looking at titles.csv, the codes have varying lengths. For example, code \'H04\' in titles.csv is present as section \'H\' and class 04, but let\'s check.\n\nIn titles.csv, first 5 rows: code \'H04\' doesn\'t appear, but looking at code \'A01\', \'A01B\', etc. \'H04\' likely corresponds to the section H class 04. So context in train.csv is like the section and class level? But wait, the answer showed that all contexts in train.csv are present in titles.csv, and train.csv contexts are 106 unique values, while titles.csv had 260k codes, but that\'s because titles.csv includes all levels (section, class, subclass, group). However, the actual context codes in train.csv are probably the main CPC codes, but maybe only the section and class levels. For example, in the training data, context is H04, which is section H, class 04. In titles.csv, there\'s a code \'H04\' which is classified as section H, class 04. Similarly, H01 is section H class 01.\n\nSo when users mention merging CPC titles, they probably want to join the train/test data with titles.csv via the context column. But in titles.csv, the code column includes all the different levels. So a context value like \'H04\' would correspond to the \'code\' column in titles.csv. So for example, row in titles.csv where code=\'H04\' would have the title for that CPC classification.\n\nBut wait, the titles.csv has 260k rows, which is all possible CPC codes at all hierarchical levels, but the context in train.csv uses only the top-level codes like H04, which are part of the 260k rows. So perhaps context in train.csv corresponds to the \'code\' in titles.csv at a certain level. For example, \'H04\' as a code in titles.csv. Let\'s check: in titles.csv\'s code column, there is a row with code \'H04\', which would give the title for that CPC code.\n\nSo merging train.csv with titles.csv on context == code would allow us to get the title of the CPC classification. For example, context \'H04\' would have a title indicating what H04 is about, like \'Electric communication technique\' or something. This allows adding the title as a feature, which could help the model understand the domain context better.\n\nAnother thing: the context in train.csv is 106 unique values, and the titles.csv has those exact codes present. So merging would work. So the developer could enhance the dataset by adding the title of the CPC code. For example, for context \'H04\', the title would be a string that describes that CPC code. This would be helpful for the model to know the domain, so when given anchor and target phrases, the model can use this context title to understand the specific domain and thus determine similarity.\n\nNow, looking at the source of the competition\'s data: train.csv has columns id, anchor, target, context (CPC code), score. So the context code is the CPC classification. So CPC codes can be read from USPTO\'s CPC structure, which is hierarchical. The titles.csv gives the descriptions for each code level.\n\nSo the next step is to check if merging by context with titles.csv code gives useful information. Since in titles.csv, code is the CPC code (like H04), then yes. So for context \'H04\', the title column would have the description. So merging train.csv and titles.csv (on context = code) would add the title to the dataset. Then, the developer can use that title as additional info.\n\nNow, what insights can we get from this merged data? For example, maybe some CPC sections have more instances in the training data than others. For example, in the original train.csv, the top contexts were H04, H01, etc. So after merging, we could check the counts of titles, which might help in understanding if certain domains are over/underrepresented.\n\nBut perhaps it\'s important now to check for data leakage. Let\'s see. What\'s the evaluation metric? Pearson correlation between predicted and actual scores. So the model has to predict a continuous score between 0 and 1 per id.\n\nThe possible features: anchor, target, context (maybe the title from titles.csv), but also maybe other features extracted from these texts. Also, the anchor has few unique values but repeated many times; targets are mostly unique. So for a given anchor, there are multiple different targets with varying scores. So the model needs to consider both the anchor, target, and context to predict similarity.\n\nNow, for leakage: we need to check if there\'s any information in the training data that would leak into the test set. For example, in questionnaires like this, potential leaks could be if the same anchor or target appears in both train and test, which is common. But usually, it\'s allowed since the test set is similar. However, maybe for some anchors that are very common in train, and test might have new ones. But probably the test has anchors and targets not seen in train, but same CPC contexts. But let\'s check.\n\nThe previous analysis: unique anchors in train: 733. Unique targets: 26850. But need to check if there\'s overlap between train and test for anchors, targets, contexts. But we don\'t have the test.csv data yet. However, the competition is a code competition, and the test.csv is provided but right now the user can\'t see it. Wait, in the data description, test.csv is provided, but we don\'t have access to it unless we run a tool to see it. Oh, but the possible tool calls: the user can\'t access test.csv without using the tools. But in the current setup, how did the assistant download external data? The initial `ask_eda` on train.csv is done, then downloaded titles.csv. But test.csv is part of the competition data already in the directory.\n\nWait, perhaps in the Kaggle environment, train.csv and test.csv are available, but when using tools, the ask_eda can read them. So earlier analysis on train.csv was done. Let\'s check if in the current state, we have the test.csv available. So when the competition is set up, the user (developer) would have test.csv and train.csv.\n\nSo in the current scenario, perhaps the assistant can run `ask_eda` on test.csv as well. But the assistant needs to check.\n\nSo possible next steps:\n\n1. Check test.csv structure and compare with train.\n\nBut the current sessions are that the assistant had run ask_eda on train.csv, downloaded the external titles, then ran ask_eda on titles.csv. Now, the assistant should check test.csv to see if structures are similar.\n\nBut perhaps I need to check for possible data leakage. For example, are there common anchors or targets between train and test? If yes, then maybe the model can be fine-tuned and get good performance. But possible leakage if similar words or contexts. But normally, in competitions like this, there\'s some overlap. However, to make sure that the model generalizes, we need to check the distribution of contexts, anchor, target in test vs train.\n\nAnother point: the context in train has 106 unique values. We should check if test has the same contexts. If the context distribution in test is similar to train, then no distribution shift.\n\nAlso, check if the score distribution in train is representative of test. But we don\'t have test\'s scores obviously, but we can check other features.\n\nSo next tool call should be to inspect test.csv structure. For example, columns, count, nulls, score is not present, but maybe the other columns.\n\nSo let\'s ask for test.csv structure.\n\nAlso, the hatful of using the download_external_datasets is done for CPC titles. Now, check if the titles.csv can be merged with train and test to get context titles.\n\nAnother possible check: for the CPC codes present in train, how many words are there in the titles of the context? For example, the title column in titles.csv for code \'H04\' might have \'Electric communication technique\' which is a long description. That could be useful as part of the input text.\n\nNow, let\'s see what to do next.\n\nThe current status is:\n\n- Train.csv has 32825 rows, no nulls.\n\n- Score distribution: skewed with 0.5 being most common.\n\n- Contexts: 106 unique, with varying frequencies.\n\n- Anchor has only 733 unique values, so high reuse of anchors.\n\n- Target has 26850 unique values, most are unique.\n\n- Titles.csv has 260476 rows, with codes at various hierarchical levels, and all contexts in train are found there.\n\nNow, the next logical step is to check the test.csv\'s structure and compare with train.\n\nSo let\'s use ask_eda on test.csv.\n\nAlso, check whether contexts in test are the same as train, and the distribution of contexts.\n\nMaybe check how many anchors and targets in test are present in train.\n\nBut first, check test structure.\n\nSo the next tool call would be ask_eda for test.csv structure.\n\nBut also, check if the test has the same columns except score. Because in test.csv, the columns are id, anchor, target, context.\n\nSo after getting test.csv structure, we can check for row count, nulls, unique contexts, anchor/target counts, etc.\n\nThen check for overlap between train and test in anchors, targets.\n\nThat\'s important to see if the data is split such that new anchors or targets are in test, so model needs to generalize.\n\nAlso, check the context distribution in test vs train.\n\nLet\'s proceed.\n\nPotential questions for ask_eda for test.csv.\n\nBut also, check if the CPC titles are available to merge. So for example, check how many contexts in test are present in titles.csv. But since train\'s contexts are in titles, perhaps test\'s too, but need to check.\n\nHowever, since the dataset has a competition, and public test set is available, but sometimes test data has new contexts. But given the context list is CPC codes, which are fixed, maybe test uses same CPC codes.\n\nBut to be sure, check.\n\nNow, let\'s plan the next steps.\n\nFirst, check the test.csv structure.\n\nSo, next ask_eda: columns, data types, row count, null counts, context unique values for test.csv.\n\nAlso, check number of unique anchors and targets in test.\n\nThen check overlap between train and test for anchors, targets, contexts.\n\nThis will help understand if leakage or domain shift is possible.\n\nIf test has contexts not in train, then that\'s a problem. But since CPC codes are part of the classification system, perhaps all contexts in test are covered in titles.csv, and likely same as train.\n\nBut let\'s see.\n\nAfter that, perhaps look into the text content of anchors/targets, maybe check if there are any specific patterns or NL issues (like punctuation, case sensitivity, etc.)\n\nAnother thing: check if the \'context\' column in train has non-alphanumeric characters, but probably it\'s like H04, etc.\n\nBut before proceeding, let\'s get insights on test data.\n', 'reasoning_details': [{'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'Okay, let me process all the information I have so far.

This allows adding the title as a feature, which could help the model understand the domain context better.\n\nAnother thing: the context in train.csv is 106 unique values, and the titles.csv has those exact codes present. So merging would work. So the developer could enhance the dataset by adding the title of the CPC code. For example, for context \'H04\', the title would be a string that describes that CPC code. This would be helpful for the model to know the domain, so when given anchor and target phrases, the model can use this context title to understand the specific domain and thus determine similarity.\n\nNow, looking at the source of the competition\'s data: train.csv has columns id, anchor, target, context (CPC code), score. So the context code is the CPC classification. So CPC codes can be read from USPTO\'s CPC structure, which is hierarchical. The titles.csv gives the descriptions for each code level.\n\nSo the next step is to check if merging by context with titles.csv code gives useful information. Since in titles.csv, code is the CPC code (like H04), then yes. So for context \'H04\', the title column would have the description. So merging train.csv and titles.csv (on context = code) would add the title to the dataset. Then, the developer can use that title as additional info.\n\nNow, what insights can we get from this merged data? For example, maybe some CPC sections have more instances in the training data than others. For example, in the original train.csv, the top contexts were H04, H01, etc. So after merging, we could check the counts of titles, which might help in understanding if certain domains are over/underrepresented.\n\nBut perhaps it\'s important now to check for data leakage. Let\'s see. What\'s the evaluation metric? Pearson correlation between predicted and actual scores. So the model has to predict a continuous score between 0 and 1 per id.\n\nThe possible features: anchor, target, context (maybe the title from titles.csv), but also maybe other features extracted from these texts. Also, the anchor has few unique values but repeated many times; targets are mostly unique. So for a given anchor, there are multiple different targets with varying scores. So the model needs to consider both the anchor, target, and context to predict similarity.\n\nNow, for leakage: we need to check if there\'s any information in the training data that would leak into the test set. For example, in questionnaires like this, potential leaks could be if the same anchor or target appears in both train and test, which is common. But usually, it\'s allowed since the test set is similar. However, maybe for some anchors that are very common in train, and test might have new ones. But probably the test has anchors and targets not seen in train, but same CPC contexts. But let\'s check.\n\nThe previous analysis: unique anchors in train: 733. Unique targets: 26850. But need to check if there\'s overlap between train and test for anchors, targets, contexts. But we don\'t have the test.csv data yet. However, the competition is a code competition, and the test.csv is provided but right now the user can\'t see it. Wait, in the data description, test.csv is provided, but we don\'t have access to it unless we run a tool to see it. Oh, but the possible tool calls: the user can\'t access test.csv without using the tools. But in the current setup, how did the assistant download external data? The initial `ask_eda` on train.csv is done, then downloaded titles.csv. But test.csv is part of the competition data already in the directory.\n\nWait, perhaps in the Kaggle environment, train.csv and test.csv are available, but when using tools, the ask_eda can read them. So earlier analysis on train.csv was done. Let\'s check if in the current state, we have the test.csv available. So when the competition is set up, the user (developer) would have test.csv and train.csv.\n\nSo in the current scenario, perhaps the assistant can run `ask_eda` on test.csv as well. But the assistant needs to check.\n\nSo possible next steps:\n\n1. Check test.csv structure and compare with train.\n\nBut the current sessions are that the assistant had run ask_eda on train.csv, downloaded the external titles, then ran ask_eda on titles.csv. Now, the assistant should check test.csv to see if structures are similar.\n\nBut perhaps I need to check for possible data leakage. For example, are there common anchors or targets between train and test? If yes, then maybe the model can be fine-tuned and get good performance. But possible leakage if similar words or contexts. But normally, in competitions like this, there\'s some overlap. However, to make sure that the model generalizes, we need to check the distribution of contexts, anchor, target in test vs train.\n\nAnother point: the context in train has 106 unique values. We should check if test has the same contexts. If the context distribution in test is similar to train, then no distribution shift.\n\nAlso, check if the score distribution in train is representative of test. But we don\'t have test\'s scores obviously, but we can check other features.\n\nSo next tool call should be to inspect test.csv structure. For example, columns, count, nulls, score is not present, but maybe the other columns.\n\nSo let\'s ask for test.csv structure.\n\nAlso, the hatful of using the download_external_datasets is done for CPC titles. Now, check if the titles.csv can be merged with train and test to get context titles.\n\nAnother possible check: for the CPC codes present in train, how many words are there in the titles of the context? For example, the title column in titles.csv for code \'H04\' might have \'Electric communication technique\' which is a long description. That could be useful as part of the input text.\n\nNow, let\'s see what to do next.\n\nThe current status is:\n\n- Train.csv has 32825 rows, no nulls.\n\n- Score distribution: skewed with 0.5 being most common.\n\n- Contexts: 106 unique, with varying frequencies.\n\n- Anchor has only 733 unique values, so high reuse of anchors.\n\n- Target has 26850 unique values, most are unique.\n\n- Titles.csv has 260476 rows, with codes at various hierarchical levels, and all contexts in train are found there.\n\nNow, the next logical step is to check the test.csv\'s structure and compare with train.\n\nSo let\'s use ask_eda on test.csv.\n\nAlso, check whether contexts in test are the same as train, and the distribution of contexts.\n\nMaybe check how many anchors and targets in test are present in train.\n\nBut first, check test structure.\n\nSo the next tool call would be ask_eda for test.csv structure.\n\nBut also, check if the test has the same columns except score. Because in test.csv, the columns are id, anchor, target, context.\n\nSo after getting test.csv structure, we can check for row count, nulls, unique contexts, anchor/target counts, etc.\n\nThen check for overlap between train and test in anchors, targets.\n\nThat\'s important to see if the data is split such that new anchors or targets are in test, so model needs to generalize.\n\nAlso, check the context distribution in test vs train.\n\nLet\'s proceed.\n\nPotential questions for ask_eda for test.csv.\n\nBut also, check if the CPC titles are available to merge. So for example, check how many contexts in test are present in titles.csv. But since train\'s contexts are in titles, perhaps test\'s too, but need to check.\n\nHowever, since the dataset has a competition, and public test set is available, but sometimes test data has new contexts. But given the context list is CPC codes, which are fixed, maybe test uses same CPC codes.\n\nBut to be sure, check.\n\nNow, let\'s plan the next steps.\n\nFirst, check the test.csv structure.\n\nSo, next ask_eda: columns, data types, row count, null counts, context unique values for test.csv.\n\nAlso, check number of unique anchors and targets in test.\n\nThen check overlap between train and test for anchors, targets, contexts.\n\nThis will help understand if leakage or domain shift is possible.\n\nIf test has contexts not in train, then that\'s a problem. But since CPC codes are part of the classification system, perhaps all contexts in test are covered in titles.csv, and likely same as train.\n\nBut let\'s see.\n\nAfter that, perhaps look into the text content of anchors/targets, maybe check if there are any specific patterns or NL issues (like punctuation, case sensitivity, etc.)\n\nAnother thing: check if the \'context\' column in train has non-alphanumeric characters, but probably it\'s like H04, etc.\n\nBut before proceeding, let\'s get insights on test data.\n', 'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0}]}, {'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_a0f1858c2fe542d383f16524', 'content': 'COLUMN NAMES AND DATA TYPES:\nid          object\nanchor      object\ntarget      object\ncontext     object\nscore      float64\ndtype: object\n\nROW COUNT:\nTotal number of rows: 3648\n\nNULL COUNTS FOR EACH COLUMN:\nid: 0\nanchor: 0\ntarget: 0\ncontext: 0\nscore: 0\n\nTOP 10 MOST FREQUENT CONTEXT VALUES:\nH01: 230\nH04: 215\nG01: 179\nA61: 165\nF16: 121\nC07: 115\nG06: 99\nB60: 94\nG02: 89\nH03: 83\n\nAVERAGE LENGTH OF ANCHOR AND TARGET:\nAverage anchor length: 16.00\nAverage target length: 15.75\n\nUNIQUE ANCHORS AND TARGETS COUNT:\nNumber of unique anchors: 703\nNumber of unique targets: 3509\n'}]

First, I need to check the competition details again to make sure I have everything.\n\nThe problem is to predict the similarity score between two phrases (anchor and target) given a context (CPC code). The evaluation is Pearson correlation. The data has train and test sets, and there\'s a titles.csv file with CPC codes and their descriptions.\n\nFrom the first tool call (ask_eda on train.csv), here\'s what I got:\n\n- Train has 32,825 rows, no nulls. Score distribution is skewed: 0.25 (31.4%), 0.50 (33.7%), 0.0 (20.6%), 0.75 (11.1%), 1.0 (3.2%). So more low to mid scores, very few perfect matches.\n\n- Contexts: top 10 codes like H04, H01, G01, etc. 106 unique contexts in total.\n\n- Anchor and target average lengths around 16 characters. Unique anchors: 733, targets: 26,850. Wait, targets have more unique values than anchors. That suggests that anchors are reused more across different pairs.\n\nThen, we downloaded external data with download_external_datasets, which added titles.csv. Then checked titles.csv. It has 260k rows, but only 106 unique contexts in train, and all of them are present in titles.csv. The CPC codes in train are a subset of the full CPC codes, which makes sense because the problem states that context is the CPC code, but maybe the code is the main group or something? The titles.csv has columns code, title, section, class, subclass, group, main_group. For example, code \'A01B1/00\' is a more detailed code, while the train context has H04, H01, etc. Wait, but in train.csv, context is like \'H04\', \'H01\' – which are sections or classes?\n\nLooking at the first row of titles.csv: code \'A\' has title \'HUMAN NECESSITIES\', section \'A\', class NaN. Then A01 has section A, class 1.0. So CPC codes can have multiple levels: section (single letter), class (two digits), subclass (letter + two digits?), group (numbers with slash), etc. But in the train dataset, the context column has codes like H04, which might be part of the CPC structure.\n\nWait, when we checked the unique contexts in train.csv, there are 106 unique values, and all of them are present in titles.csv\'s code column. But how many unique codes are in titles.csv? 260k rows because each code is detailed. For example, codes like A01B1/00 are in titles.csv, but in train.csv, context is like H04, which might be the section or class. Wait, but H is a section, 04 is a class? Let me check CPC structure.\n\nCPC classification has sections (A-H, Y), then classes (two digits), subclasses (letter + digits?), groups. For example, section H is Electricity. H04 is the class for Telecommunications, which is the code in the train context. So the context in train.csv is the CPC class code (like \'H04\'), but in titles.csv, there are more detailed codes. For example, H04 might correspond to multiple codes in titles.csv, but looking at the first rows of titles.csv, the \'code\' column starts with \'A\' (section), then A01 (class), then A01B (subclass), etc. So H04 would be the class code. So in titles.csv, maybe the H04 is found in the \'code\' column? Let\'s see. Wait, in titles.csv, code column starts with \'A\' then \'A01\', etc. So for CPC section H, class 04, the code would be \'H04\' in the code column of titles.csv? But in titles.csv, the code column has entries like \'A\', \'A01\', \'A01B\', \'A01B1/00\', etc. So maybe each row is a more detailed code, but also includes the section and class. For example, code \'H04\' would be present in the code column? Let me check the values. Let\'s see: the unique contexts in train.csv are top values like H04, H01, G01, etc. So in titles.csv, those codes like \'H04\' should exist as code entries. For instance, in titles.csv, code H04 would be an entry? Let\'s check IPPA (but we can\'t, since we have to infer from the tool response).\n\nWait, when we did the EDA on titles.csv, it says Number of unique CPC codes in titles.csv: 260476. But that must be because each row is a unique code entry (like each detailed CPC). But the actual unique codes in titles.csv (the \'code\' column) would be 260k unique rows. But when we check if all contexts in train.csv (106 unique) are present in titles.csv\'s code column, the result was true. So train\'s context \'H04\' would be present as a code in titles.csv? But looking at the first rows of titles.csv, code \'A\', \'A01\', \'A01B\', etc. So H04 would be a code entry in titles.csv? Let\'s see: in titles.csv, code \'H04\' should have a title. For example, the \'code\' column might have entries like \'H04\', which has a title like "Television systems..." or something. So the context in train.csv is the CPC code (maybe the class), which exists in titles.csv. But in the titles.csv, there\'s also more detailed codes (subclasses etc.), but the train\'s context is only the main class (like H04). So when using the titles.csv, maybe we need to map the context (e.g., \'H04\') to the corresponding title in titles.csv. Let\'s check: when we look at the titles.csv, the \'code\' column includes entries like \'H04\', so to get the title for context \'H04\', we can find the row where code is \'H04\' and take the title. However, sometimes the code might be a more detailed code, but since train\'s context is like \'H04\' (which is a class), which is present in titles.csv\'s code column. So yes, context codes in train can be used to lookup the title from titles.csv.\n\nNow the next step: look at the test set. The test has 3,648 rows, same structure as train but without score. The context values for test: top 10 are similar to train (H01, H04, etc.), so same distribution of contexts. Average lengths of anchor/target similar to train. Unique anchors in test: 703, targets: 3509. Compare to train: train had 733 unique anchors, so slightly less in test. Targets in test are 3509 unique, compared to train\'s 26k. So in both train and test, the anchor has fewer unique values than target.\n\nWait, why is the number of unique anchors so low compared to targets? For example, in train, 733 unique anchors for 32k rows. That implies that the same anchor is paired with many different targets. Similarly in test, 703 unique anchors for 3.6k rows. So maybe some anchors are used repeatedly in the dataset. For example, the anchor could be a common term like "cellphone" which is paired with different targets like "mobile phone", "smartphone", etc. This might be important for feature engineering.\n\nNext, check the score distribution. Train scores: 0.0 (20.6%), 0.25 (31.4%), 0.5 (33.7%), 0.75 (11.1%), 1.0 (3.2%). So scores are not uniformly distributed. The majority of the data has 0.25, 0.5, and 0.0. 1.0 is very rare. This is important because if the score distribution is skewed, we might need to handle it during modeling. For example, if a model is trained to predict 0.5 a lot, it might not generalize well for 1.0 or 0.75 cases. Also, for cross-validation, stratification based on score bins would be important to have each fold representative.\n\nLooking at the target variable (score), the percentages: even though 0.5 is the most common, 0.25 and 0.5 together make up ~65%. 0.0 is 20%, which is significant. So when splitting the data for CV, stratifying by these score bins can help maintain balance across folds.\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any anchor-context combinations that appear multiple times in the training data? For example, same anchor and context paired with different targets and scores. If there\'s inconsistency in scoring for same anchor-context pair, that might indicate noise in the data. But with the current EDA, we haven\'t checked that yet. However, the next step might be to check for duplicate rows or specific patterns.\n\nBut so far, data quality seems good: no nulls, all contexts present in titles.csv. So we can proceed to enrich the data with CPC titles from titles.csv.\n\nFor example, in train.csv, context is \'H04\', and from titles.csv, we can map this to the title of that CPC code. So for instance, context \'H04\' would have a title like "Telecommunications, broadcasting, etc." (real CPC details). This could be useful for the model to understand the domain. The baseline suggestions mentioned using the context text descriptions, so this makes sense.\n\nSo the next step would be to check how to merge the train and test data with the CPC title descriptions. For example, in train.csv, context column can be joined with titles.csv code column to get the title. Let\'s check the EDA results for titles.csv structure. titles.csv has code, title, section, class, subclass, group, main_group. So we can merge the train data with titles.csv on context = code. But wait, train context codes like \'H04\' might be the \'code\' in titles.csv. Let\'s check: for example, if we take context \'H04\' from train, then in titles.csv, there\'s a row where code=\'H04\' and title is the description for CPC H04.\n\nLooking at the first few rows of titles.csv, we have code \'A\' (title "HUMAN NECESSITIES"), code \'A01\' ("AGRICULTURE..."), code \'A01B\' ("SOIL WORKING..."), etc. But \'H04\' is a section (H) and class (04), so in titles.csv, is there a row with code \'H04\'? For example, in the CSV, the code might have entries like \'H04\' with title like "Telecommunication". Yes, likely. So when merging, the context (e.g., \'H04\') in train can be used to find the title in titles.csv.\n\nAnother thing to check: in titles.csv, the \'code\' column has entries like \'H04\', but also maybe more detailed ones. For example, H04B might be another entry. But the train context is H04, so it\'s possible that the code column in titles.csv has entries at different levels. So for example, if train context is \'H04\', then titles.csv has a row where code is \'H04\', which has the title for class H04.\n\nNow, what about the structure of the CPC codes? For example, H04 is a CPC class. The titles.csv might have multiple rows for different levels of code. But since train context is given at the class level, matching on code would work.\n\nNow, looking at the test set, context values are similar to train, so the same CPC titles would apply.\n\nNext step: for the model, using context title in the input. For example, concatenating anchor, target, and context title.\n\nBut before that, let\'s check if the anchor and target have certain patterns. For example, the average length is around 16 chars. Not very long, so sequence models may not need very long tokens.\n\nAnother point: number of unique anchors is much lower than unique targets. So perhaps anchor is a domain-specific term used in multiple contexts. For example, anchor="cellphone" appears multiple times with different targets. Similarly, target may be more varied.\n\nAnother check to do: how many times each anchor appears in train. For example, maybe some anchors are used in many rows. This might mean that similar anchors have different targets with varying scores. So for example, anchor "cellphone" paired with "mobile phone" (score 0.75), "smartphone" (score 0.5?), etc. But without looking at the data, it\'s hard to tell. But the high number of unique targets suggests that.\n\nBut so far, EDA shows that:\n\n- Train and test have similar context distributions.\n\n- All contexts can be mapped to titles via titles.csv.\n\n- Score distribution is skewed – 0.0, 0.25, 0.5 are common, 1.0 rare.\n\n- Good data quality (no nulls, all contexts exist in titles).\n\nPossible next EDA steps to check:\n\n1. For the same anchor and context, how does the target\'s score vary?\n\nFor example, same anchor "light" in context "G02" (Optics), paired with different targets. Do some pairs have high scores and others low? If not, maybe this is consistent, but if it varies a lot, could be clean. Or inconsistency could indicate errors.\n\n2. Check the token lengths to decide on max sequence length for BERT. For example, how many tokens the anchor + target + context would be.\n\nBut perhaps already have some info. Anchor/target length is ~16 characters. But when tokenized, it\'s different. The token length might be longer. For example, if using a tokenizer like BERT\'s, which splits words into subwords.\n\nFor example, say anchor is "telecommunication", which could be split into tokens. But the average character length gives us a rough estimate of token length.\n\nBut to be safe, better to check token lengths. But perhaps that\'s beyond the current EDA, but the developer might need to know.\n\nAnother check: are there any rare contexts in train that may not be present in test? But the context unique values between train and test are similar. For example, in train top context is H04, in test also top is H01, H04. So probably representatives.\n\nAlso, in training, the context with highest count is 1962 (H04). Test has H01 as most frequent with 230. The distribution seems similar.\n\nNext, check for label leakage: for example, if the same anchor-target pair appears in train and test, but scores are different. But since score is not in test, maybe we can check if the train and test have same id structure? No, ids are unique to each dataset. So same anchor and target and context? For example, check if any rows are duplicates between train and test. If so, that could be leakage.\n\nBut the current EDA didn\'t check if there\'s overlap between train and test. This is important. For example, if same anchor, target, context exists in train and test with different scores, that\'s a problem. But perhaps in reality, the test data is completely separate. But to be sure, we should check for such overlaps.\n\nHow to check this? For example, merge train and test on anchor, target, context and see if any rows have identical values. If so, and if in train the score is available, but in test it\'s not, then maybe the test has rows that are from train but with score missing. However, typically in competitions, the test set has no overlapping rows with train.\n\nBut better to check.\n\nAnother possible issue: if anchor and target are same in train and test, but context differs. But to check for data leakage, we need to check if any points in test were in train. If so, that\'s leakage.\n\nSo for example, check if the set of (anchor, target, context) triples in train is the same as in test. If there\'s overlap, then that\'s leakage.\n\nCurrent EDA didn\'t check this. So next step should be to check for overlapping rows between train and test.\n\nSo possible question for ask_eda:\n\n"Check the number of overlapping rows between train and test based on anchor, target, and context columns. Also count unique triples."\n\nBut let\'s think: the id is unique per dataset, but the actual content could overlap.\n\nFor example, if in train.csv, there\'s a row with anchor=\'apple\', target=\'fruit\', context=\'A23\', and test.csv has same values but different id. Then if this is present in test, but not not in train, wait, but how to check. By comparing the triples (anchor, target, context) between train and test.\n\nSo next step: ask_eda to check if anchor, target, context repeated between train and test.\n\nIf there are overlaps, then data leakage. But in reality, the competition\'s test set is supposed to be separate.\n\nAnother check: in train, how many unique (anchor, target) pairs? For example, same anchor and target in different contexts may have different scores.\n\nBut this is for EDA: maybe the same anchor and target in different contexts may have different scores. For example, anchor \'mobile\', target \'phone\' in different contexts: maybe higher score in context \'G06\' than in another context. So context matters.\n\nBut regardless, the current artifacts are that we need to check for test-train overlap.\n\nSo let\'s proceed with:\n\nCheck the number of common anchor, target, context values between train and test.\n\nSo, tool call for that.\n\nAlso, check the distribution of scores by context in train: for each context, what\'s the average score and distribution. Are some contexts more likely to have high scores?\n\nAnother possible EDA step: check average score for each context. For example, does context A (some class) have higher scores than others.\n\nBut first, check if there\'s overlap between train and test.\n\nSo current plan:\n\n1. Check for overlapping (anchor, target, context) between train and test. If yes, then there\'s leakage.\n\n2. For each context, check the average score and distribution.\n\nBut let\'s do the overlapping question first.\n\nSo for the next tool call:\n\n"Check the number of overlapping rows between train and test based on anchor, target, and context columns. Also count unique triples in each."\n\nThis is to verify that there\'s no leakage between train and test.\n\nIf there are overlapping rows, it\'s bad. If not, good.\n\nLet\'s make this a tool call.\n', 'reasoning_details': [{'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'Okay, let\'s process all the EDA results step by step. First, I need to check the competition details again to make sure I have everything.\n\nThe problem is to predict the similarity score between two phrases (anchor and target) given a context (CPC code). The evaluation is Pearson correlation. The data has train and test sets, and there\'s a titles.csv file with CPC codes and their descriptions.\n\nFrom the first tool call (ask_eda on train.csv), here\'s what I got:\n\n- Train has 32,825 rows, no nulls. Score distribution is skewed: 0.25 (31.4%), 0.50 (33.7%), 0.0 (20.6%), 0.75 (11.1%), 1.0 (3.2%). So more low to mid scores, very few perfect matches.\n\n- Contexts: top 10 codes like H04, H01, G01, etc. 106 unique contexts in total.\n\n- Anchor and target average lengths around 16 characters. Unique anchors: 733, targets: 26,850. Wait, targets have more unique values than anchors. That suggests that anchors are reused more across different pairs.\n\nThen, we downloaded external data with download_external_datasets, which added titles.csv. Then checked titles.csv. It has 260k rows, but only 106 unique contexts in train, and all of them are present in titles.csv. The CPC codes in train are a subset of the full CPC codes, which makes sense because the problem states that context is the CPC code, but maybe the code is the main group or something? The titles.csv has columns code, title, section, class, subclass, group, main_group. For example, code \'A01B1/00\' is a more detailed code, while the train context has H04, H01, etc. Wait, but in train.csv, context is like \'H04\', \'H01\' – which are sections or classes?\n\nLooking at the first row of titles.csv: code \'A\' has title \'HUMAN NECESSITIES\', section \'A\', class NaN. Then A01 has section A, class 1.0. So CPC codes can have multiple levels: section (single letter), class (two digits), subclass (letter + two digits?), group (numbers with slash), etc. But in the train dataset, the context column has codes like H04, which might be part of the CPC structure.\n\nWait, when we checked the unique contexts in train.csv, there are 106 unique values, and all of them are present in titles.csv\'s code column. But how many unique codes are in titles.csv? 260k rows because each code is detailed. For example, codes like A01B1/00 are in titles.csv, but in train.csv, context is like H04, which might be the section or class. Wait, but H is a section, 04 is a class? Let me check CPC structure.\n\nCPC classification has sections (A-H, Y), then classes (two digits), subclasses (letter + digits?), groups. For example, section H is Electricity. H04 is the class for Telecommunications, which is the code in the train context. So the context in train.csv is the CPC class code (like \'H04\'), but in titles.csv, there are more detailed codes. For example, H04 might correspond to multiple codes in titles.csv, but looking at the first rows of titles.csv, the \'code\' column starts with \'A\' (section), then A01 (class), then A01B (subclass), etc. So H04 would be the class code. So in titles.csv, maybe the H04 is found in the \'code\' column? Let\'s see. Wait, in titles.csv, code column starts with \'A\' then \'A01\', etc. So for CPC section H, class 04, the code would be \'H04\' in the code column of titles.csv? But in titles.csv, the code column has entries like \'A\', \'A01\', \'A01B\', \'A01B1/00\', etc. So maybe each row is a more detailed code, but also includes the section and class. For example, code \'H04\' would be present in the code column? Let me check the values. Let\'s see: the unique contexts in train.csv are top values like H04, H01, G01, etc. So in titles.csv, those codes like \'H04\' should exist as code entries. For instance, in titles.csv, code H04 would be an entry? Let\'s check IPPA (but we can\'t, since we have to infer from the tool response).\n\nWait, when we did the EDA on titles.csv, it says Number of unique CPC codes in titles.csv: 260476. But that must be because each row is a unique code entry (like each detailed CPC). But the actual unique codes in titles.csv (the \'code\' column) would be 260k unique rows. But when we check if all contexts in train.csv (106 unique) are present in titles.csv\'s code column, the result was true. So train\'s context \'H04\' would be present as a code in titles.csv? But looking at the first rows of titles.csv, code \'A\', \'A01\', \'A01B\', etc. So H04 would be a code entry in titles.csv? Let\'s see: in titles.csv, code \'H04\' should have a title. For example, the \'code\' column might have entries like \'H04\', which has a title like "Television systems..." or something. So the context in train.csv is the CPC code (maybe the class), which exists in titles.csv. But in the titles.csv, there\'s also more detailed codes (subclasses etc.), but the train\'s context is only the main class (like H04). So when using the titles.csv, maybe we need to map the context (e.g., \'H04\') to the corresponding title in titles.csv. Let\'s check: when we look at the titles.csv, the \'code\' column includes entries like \'H04\', so to get the title for context \'H04\', we can find the row where code is \'H04\' and take the title. However, sometimes the code might be a more detailed code, but since train\'s context is like \'H04\' (which is a class), which is present in titles.csv\'s code column. So yes, context codes in train can be used to lookup the title from titles.csv.\n\nNow the next step: look at the test set. The test has 3,648 rows, same structure as train but without score. The context values for test: top 10 are similar to train (H01, H04, etc.), so same distribution of contexts. Average lengths of anchor/target similar to train. Unique anchors in test: 703, targets: 3509. Compare to train: train had 733 unique anchors, so slightly less in test. Targets in test are 3509 unique, compared to train\'s 26k. So in both train and test, the anchor has fewer unique values than target.\n\nWait, why is the number of unique anchors so low compared to targets? For example, in train, 733 unique anchors for 32k rows. That implies that the same anchor is paired with many different targets. Similarly in test, 703 unique anchors for 3.6k rows. So maybe some anchors are used repeatedly in the dataset. For example, the anchor could be a common term like "cellphone" which is paired with different targets like "mobile phone", "smartphone", etc. This might be important for feature engineering.\n\nNext, check the score distribution. Train scores: 0.0 (20.6%), 0.25 (31.4%), 0.5 (33.7%), 0.75 (11.1%), 1.0 (3.2%). So scores are not uniformly distributed. The majority of the data has 0.25, 0.5, and 0.0. 1.0 is very rare. This is important because if the score distribution is skewed, we might need to handle it during modeling. For example, if a model is trained to predict 0.5 a lot, it might not generalize well for 1.0 or 0.75 cases. Also, for cross-validation, stratification based on score bins would be important to have each fold representative.\n\nLooking at the target variable (score), the percentages: even though 0.5 is the most common, 0.25 and 0.5 together make up ~65%. 0.0 is 20%, which is significant. So when splitting the data for CV, stratifying by these score bins can help maintain balance across folds.\n\nAnother thing to check: are there any anchor-context combinations that appear multiple times in the training data? For example, same anchor and context paired with different targets and scores. If there\'s inconsistency in scoring for same anchor-context pair, that might indicate noise in the data. But with the current EDA, we haven\'t checked that yet. However, the next step might be to check for duplicate rows or specific patterns.\n\nBut so far, data quality seems good: no nulls, all contexts present in titles.csv. So we can proceed to enrich the data with CPC titles from titles.csv.\n\nFor example, in train.csv, context is \'H04\', and from titles.csv, we can map this to the title of that CPC code. So for instance, context \'H04\' would have a title like "Telecommunications, broadcasting, etc." (real CPC details). This could be useful for the model to understand the domain. The baseline suggestions mentioned using the context text descriptions, so this makes sense.\n\nSo the next step would be to check how to merge the train and test data with the CPC title descriptions. For example, in train.csv, context column can be joined with titles.csv code column to get the title. Let\'s check the EDA results for titles.csv structure. titles.csv has code, title, section, class, subclass, group, main_group. So we can merge the train data with titles.csv on context = code. But wait, train context codes like \'H04\' might be the \'code\' in titles.csv. Let\'s check: for example, if we take context \'H04\' from train, then in titles.csv, there\'s a row where code=\'H04\' and title is the description for CPC H04.\n\nLooking at the first few rows of titles.csv, we have code \'A\' (title "HUMAN NECESSITIES"), code \'A01\' ("AGRICULTURE..."), code \'A01B\' ("SOIL WORKING..."), etc. But \'H04\' is a section (H) and class (04), so in titles.csv, is there a row with code \'H04\'? For example, in the CSV, the code might have entries like \'H04\' with title like "Telecommunication". Yes, likely. So when merging, the context (e.g., \'H04\') in train can be used to find the title in titles.csv.\n\nAnother thing to check: in titles.csv, the \'code\' column has entries like \'H04\', but also maybe more detailed ones. For example, H04B might be another entry. But the train context is H04, so it\'s possible that the code column in titles.csv has entries at different levels. So for example, if train context is \'H04\', then titles.csv has a row where code is \'H04\', which has the title for class H04.\n\nNow, what about the structure of the CPC codes? For example, H04 is a CPC class. The titles.csv might have multiple rows for different levels of code. But since train context is given at the class level, matching on code would work.\n\nNow, looking at the test set, context values are similar to train, so the same CPC titles would apply.\n\nNext step: for the model, using context title in the input. For example, concatenating anchor, target, and context title.\n\nBut before that, let\'s check if the anchor and target have certain patterns. For example, the average length is around 16 chars. Not very long, so sequence models may not need very long tokens.\n\nAnother point: number of unique anchors is much lower than unique targets. So perhaps anchor is a domain-specific term used in multiple contexts. For example, anchor="cellphone" appears multiple times with different targets. Similarly, target may be more varied.\n\nAnother check to do: how many times each anchor appears in train. For example, maybe some anchors are used in many rows. This might mean that similar anchors have different targets with varying scores. So for example, anchor "cellphone" paired with "mobile phone" (score 0.75), "smartphone" (score 0.5?), etc. But without looking at the data, it\'s hard to tell. But the high number of unique targets suggests that.\n\nBut so far, EDA shows that:\n\n- Train and test have similar context distributions.\n\n- All contexts can be mapped to titles via titles.csv.\n\n- Score distribution is skewed – 0.0, 0.25, 0.5 are common, 1.0 rare.\n\n- Good data quality (no nulls, all contexts exist in titles).\n\nPossible next EDA steps to check:\n\n1. For the same anchor and context, how does the target\'s score vary?\n\nFor example, same anchor "light" in context "G02" (Optics), paired with different targets. Do some pairs have high scores and others low? If not, maybe this is consistent, but if it varies a lot, could be clean. Or inconsistency could indicate errors.\n\n2. Check the token lengths to decide on max sequence length for BERT. For example, how many tokens the anchor + target + context would be.\n\nBut perhaps already have some info. Anchor/target length is ~16 characters. But when tokenized, it\'s different. The token length might be longer. For example, if using a tokenizer like BERT\'s, which splits words into subwords.\n\nFor example, say anchor is "telecommunication", which could be split into tokens. But the average character length gives us a rough estimate of token length.\n\nBut to be safe, better to check token lengths. But perhaps that\'s beyond the current EDA, but the developer might need to know.\n\nAnother check: are there any rare contexts in train that may not be present in test? But the context unique values between train and test are similar. For example, in train top context is H04, in test also top is H01, H04. So probably representatives.\n\nAlso, in training, the context with highest count is 1962 (H04). Test has H01 as most frequent with 230. The distribution seems similar.\n\nNext, check for label leakage: for example, if the same anchor-target pair appears in train and test, but scores are different. But since score is not in test, maybe we can check if the train and test have same id structure? No, ids are unique to each dataset. So same anchor and target and context? For example, check if any rows are duplicates between train and test. If so, that could be leakage.\n\nBut the current EDA didn\'t check if there\'s overlap between train and test. This is important. For example, if same anchor, target, context exists in train and test with different scores, that\'s a problem. But perhaps in reality, the test data is completely separate. But to be sure, we should check for such overlaps.\n\nHow to check this? For example, merge train and test on anchor, target, context and see if any rows have identical values. If so, and if in train the score is available, but in test it\'s not, then maybe the test has rows that are from train but with score missing. However, typically in competitions, the test set has no overlapping rows with train.\n\nBut better to check.\n\nAnother possible issue: if anchor and target are same in train and test, but context differs. But to check for data leakage, we need to check if any points in test were in train. If so, that\'s leakage.\n\nSo for example, check if the set of (anchor, target, context) triples in train is the same as in test. If there\'s overlap, then that\'s leakage.\n\nCurrent EDA didn\'t check this. So next step should be to check for overlapping rows between train and test.\n\nSo possible question for ask_eda:\n\n"Check the number of overlapping rows between train and test based on anchor, target, and context columns. Also count unique triples."\n\nBut let\'s think: the id is unique per dataset, but the actual content could overlap.\n\nFor example, if in train.csv, there\'s a row with anchor=\'apple\', target=\'fruit\', context=\'A23\', and test.csv has same values but different id. Then if this is present in test, but not not in train, wait, but how to check. By comparing the triples (anchor, target, context) between train and test.\n\nSo next step: ask_eda to check if anchor, target, context repeated between train and test.\n\nIf there are overlaps, then data leakage. But in reality, the competition\'s test set is supposed to be separate.\n\nAnother check: in train, how many unique (anchor, target) pairs? For example, same anchor and target in different contexts may have different scores.\n\nBut this is for EDA: maybe the same anchor and target in different contexts may have different scores. For example, anchor \'mobile\', target \'phone\' in different contexts: maybe higher score in context \'G06\' than in another context. So context matters.\n\nBut regardless, the current artifacts are that we need to check for test-train overlap.\n\nSo let\'s proceed with:\n\nCheck the number of common anchor, target, context values between train and test.\n\nSo, tool call for that.\n\nAlso, check the distribution of scores by context in train: for each context, what\'s the average score and distribution. Are some contexts more likely to have high scores?\n\nAnother possible EDA step: check average score for each context. For example, does context A (some class) have higher scores than others.\n\nBut first, check if there\'s overlap between train and test.\n\nSo current plan:\n\n1. Check for overlapping (anchor, target, context) between train and test. If yes, then there\'s leakage.\n\n2. For each context, check the average score and distribution.\n\nBut let\'s do the overlapping question first.\n\nSo for the next tool call:\n\n"Check the number of overlapping rows between train and test based on anchor, target, and context columns. Also count unique triples in each."\n\nThis is to verify that there\'s no leakage between train and test.\n\nIf there are overlapping rows, it\'s bad. If not, good.\n\nLet\'s make this a tool call.\n', 'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0}]}, {'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_d157da6f9f594be3ae4b8dd5', 'content': 'Train dataset has 32825 total rows and 32825 unique triples\nTest dataset has 3648 total rows and 3648 unique triples\nNumber of overlapping unique triples between train and test: 0\nThere are no overlapping triples between train and test datasets\n'}]

The user has provided a competition where the task is to predict the semantic similarity score between pairs of phrases (anchor and target) within a specific CPC context.\n\nFirst, the dataset structure: training data has 32,825 rows, test data has 3,648. No missing values in either, which is good. The score distribution is skewed: most scores are 0.25 (31.4%), 0.5 (33.7%), then 0.0 (20.6%), 0.75 (11.1%), and 1.0 (3.2%). The highest frequency is for 0.5, which might mean models should be cautious about predicting high scores too often.\n\nLooking at context codes, the top ones like H04, H01, G01, A61, etc., have high frequencies. From the titles.csv, we have all CPC codes from the training data present. For example, the train context has 106 unique codes, and titles.csv has them all. That\'s important because we can merge the titles to get more context descriptions, which might help the model understand the technical domain better.\n\nThe average anchor and target lengths are both around 16 characters. That\'s short, so maybe tokenization won\'t need very long sequences. But since we have to concatenate anchor, target, and context, the total length might be more. For example, average anchor (16) + target (16) + context (maybe longer?) but context in the training data is like "H04" which is a short code. However, the titles.csv has actual titles for each CPC code. Wait, in the train.csv, context is like "H04", but in titles.csv, they have columns like \'code\' (e.g., \'H04A\', \'H04B\') and \'title\' which is the description. So maybe context codes in training data need to be mapped to their full titles. That\'s a key point from the supporting baseline notes.\n\nThe user checked that the test and train datasets don\'t have any overlapping triples (anchor, target, context pairs). So no direct duplicates between train and test. But this could mean that model might need to generalize to new combinations, not just memorize patterns from the dataset.\n\nAlso, looking at unique anchors and targets: in train, unique anchors 733 vs 26,850 unique targets. That\'s interesting. But wait, wait—wait when they ran "Number of unique anchors: 733" and "Number of unique targets: 26850" for train data. Wait, no, the previous `ask_eda` for train\'s unique anchors and targets: the answer showed "Number of unique anchors: 733" and "Number of unique targets: 26850". That seems odd. Wait, in a dataset of 32k rows, having only 733 unique anchors but 26k unique targets suggests that many anchors repeat across many targets. For example, one anchor might be paired with multiple targets. Similarly, in the test data, unique anchors 703 and unique targets 3509. So the anchor field has many repetitions.\n\nWait, but in the train.csv, context is also a column. So maybe the same anchor can be in different contexts. But the key question: does the same anchor-target pair appear in different contexts? But according to the previous check of overlapping triples (anchor, target, context), there are no overlaps between train and test. But when we count unique anchors in train (733), that\'s just the anchor column regardless of context. Similarly, targets can repeat but maybe in different contexts. Wait, no—32k rows, with anchors only 733 unique, so on average each anchor appears in 32k / 733 ≈ 44 times. But the targets have 26k unique, so most targets only appear once. So the dataset is structured such that there are a smaller number of anchors that are reused across many different targets.\n\nBut how does context affect this? For example, anchor "television set" might appear in context "H01" (electrical machinery) vs "G06" (computing), but in different rows.\n\nNow, a potential concern: if the same anchor appears in multiple rows with different contexts but the same target, how does the score vary? But that\'s something that could be checked with another EDA step. However, the user hasn\'t done that yet.\n\nAlso, the evaluation metric is Pearson correlation. So the model needs to predict scores that correlate well with actual scores. So regression task, but the scores are discrete values (0.0, 0.25, etc.), but Pearson correlation can handle continuous predictions.\n\nLooking at the target variable (score), the distribution is skewed, especially low counts for 1.0 and higher for 0.25 and 0.5. This might lead to models not performing well on the extremes. But since Pearson correlates predictions with actual, it\'s more about ranking than absolute accuracy.\n\nAnother angle: CPC code context. Each context code in the training data (like \'H04\') corresponds to a specific section. From titles.csv, let\'s see what the \'H04\' code\'s title is. For example, titles.csv had code \'H04\' but looking at the sample rows, the code could have sections like A, sub-classes. Wait, but in the titles.csv data, the code is the CPC code. So code like \'H04\' might not be present in the code column as a standalone code, but maybe \'H04B\' or similar. Wait, but the train.csv\'s context column shows \'H04\', \'H01\', etc. So perhaps in the titles.csv, the code column is the 4-letter codes like \'H04B\'. But when looking at the first example in titles.csv:\n\ncode: \'A\', \'A01\', \'A01B\', \'A01B1/00\', etc.\n\nWait the code column in titles.csv has entries like \'A\', \'A01\', \'A01B\', \'A01B1/00\'. So the hierarchy in CPC is section, class, subclass, group, etc. But the context field in train.csv is like \'H04\', which perhaps is the class level or subclass? For example, CPC codes are divided into sections (single letters like \'H\'), then classes (like \'H04\' for electric communication), then subclasses (H04B). But maybe the context in train.csv corresponds to a CPC class. Let\'s check.\n\nWait, the user\'s previous check showed that the unique contexts in train.csv (106) all exist in titles.csv. But in titles.csv, each row has a unique code. So for example, in titles.csv, H04B would be a specific code. However, the context in train.csv has values like \'H04\' (without the subparts), which might correspond to a class. So perhaps to get the full title for the context in train.csv, we need to find the main title for that CPC class.\n\nWait, the context in train.csv is a CPC code. For example, \'H04\' in the train data\'s context column. Checking the titles.csv code column: looking at the example rows, code \'H04\' isn\'t present. The codes start with \'A\', \'A01\', \'A01B\', etc. Let me check the previous result: for the titles.csv, code had entries like \'A\', \'A01\', \'A01B\', \'A01B1/00\', \'A01B1/02\', etc. So the code in titles.csv includes section (A), class (A01), subclass (A01B), and then more specific codes. Wait, but \'H04\' as a code may be a section H (for electric communication), but CPC class for electric communication is H04. So for example, the section \'H\' is Electric Communications, then class \'H04\' refers to electric communication.\n\nBut perhaps the train.csv context is the class level (two digits like H04, but \'H\' is section).\n\nWait, in CPC, sections are single letters (A-H), then classes are two digits (like H04), but sometimes sections are part of the code. Wait, actually, CPC code structures: the first character is the section, followed by the class number, then subclass, etc. So for example, section H (Electricity), class H04 (Telecommunications), subclass H04B, etc. So the context in train.csv is likely the CPC class code like H04. But in the titles.csv, code \'H04\' may not exist; instead, maybe it\'s stored as \'H04\'? Let me check the sample data from titles.csv. The first row in titles.csv is code \'A\' (section), then \'A01\' (class), \'A01B\' (subclass), etc. So in the titles.csv data, codes like \'H04\' might be present. Wait, let\'s assume that the titles.csv\'s code column contains the CPC codes, including sections and classes.\n\nLooking back: the EDA for titles.csv showed "Number of unique CPC codes in titles.csv: 260476", but that doesn\'t seem right. Wait, 260476 rows in titles.csv, each code is unique? So each code in the code column is a unique CP code. But CPC codes have hierarchy. For example, section A is the top-level, then A01, A01B, etc., and each code is unique. So for context codes in train.csv (like \'H04\'), which is a class, perhaps in titles.csv, the code \'H04\' exists. Let\'s check the previous output: the titles.csv\'s code column, the first rows show code as \'A\', \'A01\', \'A01B\', \'A01B1/00\', etc. So if the train context is \'H04\', then there should be a title for it. But in the sample, codes like \'H04\' would be a class code. Let\'s say that the code column in titles.csv includes all levels, but also possibly the higher-level codes. For example, \'H04\' might exist as a row. Let\'s check the example. The first row was code \'A\' (section), which is correct since A is a section. Then \'A01\' (class), \'A01B\' (subclass), etc. So CPC codes in the titles.csv\'s code column include sections (like \'A\'), classes (like \'A01\'), subclasses (like \'A01B\'), and more specific codes. So when the context in train.csv is \'H04\', which is a class code (since H is section, 04 is class), then there should be a corresponding code in titles.csv as \'H04\' (but maybe written as \'H04\' but titles.csv codes like \'H04\' is possible. Let\'s see, for example, code \'H04\' in the code column. If yes, then that\'s the title for class \'H04\'.\n\nBut the main point is: the context in train.csv is a CPC code (like \'H04\'), and in titles.csv, those codes can be looked up for their full descriptions. So merging the train data with titles.csv on the context column (which matches the code column in titles.csv) would add the actual title for that CPC code. For example, context \'H04\' would map to "Electric communication" or something similar. This would give the model more context.\n\nNow, looking at the next steps: how to proceed.\n\nThe next area to check is whether the context codes in training and test data have different distributions. We have top contexts for train and test. Let\'s check that. In train, top contexts: H04, H01, G01, A61, etc. In test, top contexts: H01 (230), H04 (215), G01 (179), etc. So similar top contexts. Could this mean similarity between train and test distributions?\n\nAlso, maybe looking at the distribution of contexts in train vs test. For example, do both have similar proportions of each context? Maybe the context distribution is similar between train and test.\n\nAnother angle: checking how the score varies across different contexts. For example, in context \'H04\', how is the score distributed? This could be important if different fields have different patterns. For example, in electrical communication (H04), maybe certain phrases are more likely to have high similarity scores because of specific terminology.\n\nBut this would require a cross-tabulation between context and score. Let\'s see if there\'s any previous question about that. The current EDA hasn\'t checked context-specific score distributions yet. Also, the number of unique scores per context might vary. For example, some contexts may have more scores of 1.0, others less.\n\nAlso, another thing: the average length of anchor and target by context. For example, maybe in some contexts, the phrases tend to be longer or shorter.\n\nBut all that can be checked via ask_eda.\n\nAnother thought: the dataset has no overlapping triples, so the model will have to generalize to new anchor, target, context combinations. But that\'s already known.\n\nNow, going back to what the developer might need. According to the supporting baseline notes, many competitors merge title information from the titles.csv to enrich the context with the actual title.\n\nThe current steps so far:\n\n1. Checked train and test structure: no missing values, score distribution.\n2. Downloaded and checked titles.csv, which has title info for CPC codes.\n3. Confirmed all train contexts exist in titles.csv.\n4. Checked unique anchors and targets, their repetition counts.\n5. Checked no overlapping triples between train and test.\n\nNext steps to do:\n\n- Check context-specific score distribution. For example, for each context, what\'s the distribution of scores. Are some contexts more likely to have high scores? Like \'H04\' context may have score 0.75 often because certain terms have synonyms (like \'mobile phone\' vs. \'cellphone\'), which is a common synonym.\n\n- Also, check how the target\'s length varies with context or score.\n\n- Also, maybe check the relationship between context and score. For example, "in which context are the highest scores found?"\n\nAnother tool call could be to merge train.csv with titles.csv on context/code and then check the distribution of scores across the different CPC titles.\n\nBut to do this, first, let\'s see what the titles.csv\'s title column says for a few context codes. For example, in train.csv context \'H04\' would have a title in titles.csv. Let\'s download data and merge, then ask EDA about that.\n\nAlternatively, the user has already downloaded titles.csv, so maybe use ask_eda to check the title for a specific context.\n\nBut perhaps first, check the correlation between context code and score. Let\'s see.\n\nLet\'s think about possible hypotheses and check them.\n\nHypothesis 1: The CPC context affects the score distribution (e.g., some contexts have higher average scores).\n\nHypothesis 2: The presence of certain words in anchor or target (like digits, special characters) may correlate with score.\n\nHypothesis 3: The interaction between anchor and target text varies by context, so including the context title is crucial.\n\nFor example, in the context of "A61" (medical), a phrase like "heart" might have a high score with "cardiovascular", but lower with "processor", so the context matters.\n\nThis is probably a very important point. Let\'s check how context influences scores.\n\nSo, next step: for each context (or at least top contexts), check the score distribution.\n\nFor example, in train.csv, group by context and then compute median or average score for each context.\n\nHow many unique contexts in train: 106. So that\'s manageable. The top 10 contexts have high counts.\n\nSo, let\'s run an EDA for score distribution per context (top 10 contexts).\n\nAlso, check if for the same anchor, different contexts yield different scores. For example, same anchor used with same target but different context, does the score change? That would indicate context matters. But since in train.csv, each triple is unique (anchor, target, context), to check this, need to find if any (anchor, target) pair appears with different contexts. But looking at the data: unique triples, so if anchor and target are same but context differs, then multiple rows.\n\nWait, the earlier check of unique triples: for train.csv, 32825 unique triples (since total rows is 32825 and was found unique). So each triple is unique. So if (anchor, target, context) repeats, but the data doesn\'t have duplicates. So it\'s possible to have same anchor and target with different contexts.\n\nFor example, anchor "electricity" and target "power" could be in different contexts like \'H04\' and \'G01\', with different scores.\n\nSo this would be a good check. But to find if there are multiple rows with same anchor and target but different contexts.\n\nLet me check how many unique (anchor, target) pairs in train.csv.\n\nWait, from the previous EDA question: for train, unique anchors 733, unique targets 26850. So number of unique (anchor, target) pairs: probably 32825 because each row is unique triple. But maybe some anchor-target pairs repeat in different contexts.\n\nLet\'s check: if we group by anchor and target and count how many times the pair appears. For example, doing:\n\ntrain[[\'anchor\', \'target\']].value_counts().max()\n\nBut previously EDA didn\'t check that. So perhaps a useful next step.\n\nBut according to current data, there are 32k unique triples. So each anchor-target-context triple is unique. Therefore, anchor-target pairs might repeat with different contexts.\n\nSo, how many distinct (anchor, target) pairs are there in train? If it\'s less than 32825, that would mean some anchor-target combinations are in multiple contexts.\n\nThis could be important for model design, because the model would have to consider context even when anchor-target is the same.\n\nSo, the value_counts for anchor and target would be less than 32k. Let\'s ask for that.\n\nBut perhaps also check if the same anchor-target pair in different contexts has different scores. If yes, that confirms context is crucial.\n\nThat\'s a critical insight. If the same anchor and target have different scores based on context, then without including context in the model, it won\'t work properly.\n\nSo this is a key hypothesis to check.\n\nSo next tool call: check for how many (anchor, target) pairs have different contexts and different scores.\n\nSo, count the number of anchor-target pairs that appear in multiple contexts with different scores.\n\nLet\'s proceed with that.\n\nAnother hypothesis: the context title (the descriptive text) is important. For example, if the model can see that the context is "Electric Communication" versus "Medical Instruments", it can adjust the similarity accordingly. So merging the context code with titles.csv to get the context description would help.\n\nWe\'ve already confirmed that all train contexts exist in titles.csv. So next step would be to merge them and use the title columns as additional context.\n\nBut before recommending merging, it\'s good to check if the context title contains info that\'s not present in the CPC code, which would be helpful for the model.\n\nFor example, CPC code \'H04\' might be "Electric communication systems", which is more informative than just \'H04\'.\n\nSo merging the titles is a good strategy as seen in support baselines.\n\nNow, to build a plan.\n\nSo far:\n\n- Check score distribution, context top 10, data quality: done.\n\n- Check titles.csv: exists, all contexts present.\n\n- Check no overlapping triples, so generalization needed.\n\nNow, next questions:\n\n1. For each context in the top 10, what\'s the score distribution? (e.g., H04\'s average score, breakdown of scores)\n\n2. How many (anchor, target) pairs appear in more than one context? And what\'s the variance in scores for those pairs? (this would show context dependency)\n\n3. What are the common words in high score vs low score pairs? (but might need tokenization or basic analysis)\n\nBut for now, since the question is to confirm context\'s role, step 2 is high priority.\n\nSo let\'s query for:\n\n- For train.csv, group by anchor and target, then count the number of unique contexts for each pair. For pairs with more than one context, check the scores for those contexts.\n\nFor example, how many such pairs exist, and what\'s the Pearson correlation between context and score for those pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe more simply just find examples where anchor and target are same but context differs and scores differ.\n\nFor example, get a few examples to verify.\n\nBut EDA can count the number of pairs where context index leads to different scores.\n\nThis is a key step.\n\nSo, the next tool call would be: find the number of anchor-target pairs that appear with multiple contexts and have different scores. Also check an example of such a thing.\n\nLet\'s code that.\n\nFor instance:\n\ngroup by anchor and target, then check if the max score != min score. If yes, that pair has different scores in different contexts.\n\nSo, count the number of such pairs, and examples.\n\nThis would confirm context matters.\n\nLet\'s call ask_eda with that question.\n\nAlso, another check: what\'s the average score per context (top contexts), to see if context-specific score averages vary significantly.\n\nFor example, average score for context H04, H01, etc.\n\nAnother aspect: the average anchor and target lengths by context (e.g., do medical contexts have longer phrases?).\n\nBut context\'s role in score seems critical.\n\nSo the next step is to check context-specific scores and anchor-target pairs across contexts.\n\nLet\'s do that.', 'reasoning_details': [{'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'Okay, let\'s start by summarizing the key insights from the EDA tools we\'ve used so far. The user has provided a competition where the task is to predict the semantic similarity score between pairs of phrases (anchor and target) within a specific CPC context.\n\nFirst, the dataset structure: training data has 32,825 rows, test data has 3,648. No missing values in either, which is good. The score distribution is skewed: most scores are 0.25 (31.4%), 0.5 (33.7%), then 0.0 (20.6%), 0.75 (11.1%), and 1.0 (3.2%). The highest frequency is for 0.5, which might mean models should be cautious about predicting high scores too often.\n\nLooking at context codes, the top ones like H04, H01, G01, A61, etc., have high frequencies. From the titles.csv, we have all CPC codes from the training data present. For example, the train context has 106 unique codes, and titles.csv has them all. That\'s important because we can merge the titles to get more context descriptions, which might help the model understand the technical domain better.\n\nThe average anchor and target lengths are both around 16 characters. That\'s short, so maybe tokenization won\'t need very long sequences. But since we have to concatenate anchor, target, and context, the total length might be more. For example, average anchor (16) + target (16) + context (maybe longer?) but context in the training data is like "H04" which is a short code. However, the titles.csv has actual titles for each CPC code. Wait, in the train.csv, context is like "H04", but in titles.csv, they have columns like \'code\' (e.g., \'H04A\', \'H04B\') and \'title\' which is the description. So maybe context codes in training data need to be mapped to their full titles. That\'s a key point from the supporting baseline notes.\n\nThe user checked that the test and train datasets don\'t have any overlapping triples (anchor, target, context pairs). So no direct duplicates between train and test. But this could mean that model might need to generalize to new combinations, not just memorize patterns from the dataset.\n\nAlso, looking at unique anchors and targets: in train, unique anchors 733 vs 26,850 unique targets. That\'s interesting. But wait, wait—wait when they ran "Number of unique anchors: 733" and "Number of unique targets: 26850" for train data. Wait, no, the previous `ask_eda` for train\'s unique anchors and targets: the answer showed "Number of unique anchors: 733" and "Number of unique targets: 26850". That seems odd. Wait, in a dataset of 32k rows, having only 733 unique anchors but 26k unique targets suggests that many anchors repeat across many targets. For example, one anchor might be paired with multiple targets. Similarly, in the test data, unique anchors 703 and unique targets 3509. So the anchor field has many repetitions.\n\nWait, but in the train.csv, context is also a column. So maybe the same anchor can be in different contexts. But the key question: does the same anchor-target pair appear in different contexts? But according to the previous check of overlapping triples (anchor, target, context), there are no overlaps between train and test. But when we count unique anchors in train (733), that\'s just the anchor column regardless of context. Similarly, targets can repeat but maybe in different contexts. Wait, no—32k rows, with anchors only 733 unique, so on average each anchor appears in 32k / 733 ≈ 44 times. But the targets have 26k unique, so most targets only appear once. So the dataset is structured such that there are a smaller number of anchors that are reused across many different targets.\n\nBut how does context affect this? For example, anchor "television set" might appear in context "H01" (electrical machinery) vs "G06" (computing), but in different rows.\n\nNow, a potential concern: if the same anchor appears in multiple rows with different contexts but the same target, how does the score vary? But that\'s something that could be checked with another EDA step. However, the user hasn\'t done that yet.\n\nAlso, the evaluation metric is Pearson correlation. So the model needs to predict scores that correlate well with actual scores. So regression task, but the scores are discrete values (0.0, 0.25, etc.), but Pearson correlation can handle continuous predictions.\n\nLooking at the target variable (score), the distribution is skewed, especially low counts for 1.0 and higher for 0.25 and 0.5. This might lead to models not performing well on the extremes. But since Pearson correlates predictions with actual, it\'s more about ranking than absolute accuracy.\n\nAnother angle: CPC code context. Each context code in the training data (like \'H04\') corresponds to a specific section. From titles.csv, let\'s see what the \'H04\' code\'s title is. For example, titles.csv had code \'H04\' but looking at the sample rows, the code could have sections like A, sub-classes. Wait, but in the titles.csv data, the code is the CPC code. So code like \'H04\' might not be present in the code column as a standalone code, but maybe \'H04B\' or similar. Wait, but the train.csv\'s context column shows \'H04\', \'H01\', etc. So perhaps in the titles.csv, the code column is the 4-letter codes like \'H04B\'. But when looking at the first example in titles.csv:\n\ncode: \'A\', \'A01\', \'A01B\', \'A01B1/00\', etc.\n\nWait the code column in titles.csv has entries like \'A\', \'A01\', \'A01B\', \'A01B1/00\'. So the hierarchy in CPC is section, class, subclass, group, etc. But the context field in train.csv is like \'H04\', which perhaps is the class level or subclass? For example, CPC codes are divided into sections (single letters like \'H\'), then classes (like \'H04\' for electric communication), then subclasses (H04B). But maybe the context in train.csv corresponds to a CPC class. Let\'s check.\n\nWait, the user\'s previous check showed that the unique contexts in train.csv (106) all exist in titles.csv. But in titles.csv, each row has a unique code. So for example, in titles.csv, H04B would be a specific code. However, the context in train.csv has values like \'H04\' (without the subparts), which might correspond to a class. So perhaps to get the full title for the context in train.csv, we need to find the main title for that CPC class.\n\nWait, the context in train.csv is a CPC code. For example, \'H04\' in the train data\'s context column. Checking the titles.csv code column: looking at the example rows, code \'H04\' isn\'t present. The codes start with \'A\', \'A01\', \'A01B\', etc. Let me check the previous result: for the titles.csv, code had entries like \'A\', \'A01\', \'A01B\', \'A01B1/00\', \'A01B1/02\', etc. So the code in titles.csv includes section (A), class (A01), subclass (A01B), and then more specific codes. Wait, but \'H04\' as a code may be a section H (for electric communication), but CPC class for electric communication is H04. So for example, the section \'H\' is Electric Communications, then class \'H04\' refers to electric communication.\n\nBut perhaps the train.csv context is the class level (two digits like H04, but \'H\' is section).\n\nWait, in CPC, sections are single letters (A-H), then classes are two digits (like H04), but sometimes sections are part of the code. Wait, actually, CPC code structures: the first character is the section, followed by the class number, then subclass, etc. So for example, section H (Electricity), class H04 (Telecommunications), subclass H04B, etc. So the context in train.csv is likely the CPC class code like H04. But in the titles.csv, code \'H04\' may not exist; instead, maybe it\'s stored as \'H04\'? Let me check the sample data from titles.csv. The first row in titles.csv is code \'A\' (section), then \'A01\' (class), \'A01B\' (subclass), etc. So in the titles.csv data, codes like \'H04\' might be present. Wait, let\'s assume that the titles.csv\'s code column contains the CPC codes, including sections and classes.\n\nLooking back: the EDA for titles.csv showed "Number of unique CPC codes in titles.csv: 260476", but that doesn\'t seem right. Wait, 260476 rows in titles.csv, each code is unique? So each code in the code column is a unique CP code. But CPC codes have hierarchy. For example, section A is the top-level, then A01, A01B, etc., and each code is unique. So for context codes in train.csv (like \'H04\'), which is a class, perhaps in titles.csv, the code \'H04\' exists. Let\'s check the previous output: the titles.csv\'s code column, the first rows show code as \'A\', \'A01\', \'A01B\', \'A01B1/00\', etc. So if the train context is \'H04\', then there should be a title for it. But in the sample, codes like \'H04\' would be a class code. Let\'s say that the code column in titles.csv includes all levels, but also possibly the higher-level codes. For example, \'H04\' might exist as a row. Let\'s check the example. The first row was code \'A\' (section), which is correct since A is a section. Then \'A01\' (class), \'A01B\' (subclass), etc. So CPC codes in the titles.csv\'s code column include sections (like \'A\'), classes (like \'A01\'), subclasses (like \'A01B\'), and more specific codes. So when the context in train.csv is \'H04\', which is a class code (since H is section, 04 is class), then there should be a corresponding code in titles.csv as \'H04\' (but maybe written as \'H04\' but titles.csv codes like \'H04\' is possible. Let\'s see, for example, code \'H04\' in the code column. If yes, then that\'s the title for class \'H04\'.\n\nBut the main point is: the context in train.csv is a CPC code (like \'H04\'), and in titles.csv, those codes can be looked up for their full descriptions. So merging the train data with titles.csv on the context column (which matches the code column in titles.csv) would add the actual title for that CPC code. For example, context \'H04\' would map to "Electric communication" or something similar. This would give the model more context.\n\nNow, looking at the next steps: how to proceed.\n\nThe next area to check is whether the context codes in training and test data have different distributions. We have top contexts for train and test. Let\'s check that. In train, top contexts: H04, H01, G01, A61, etc. In test, top contexts: H01 (230), H04 (215), G01 (179), etc. So similar top contexts. Could this mean similarity between train and test distributions?\n\nAlso, maybe looking at the distribution of contexts in train vs test. For example, do both have similar proportions of each context? Maybe the context distribution is similar between train and test.\n\nAnother angle: checking how the score varies across different contexts. For example, in context \'H04\', how is the score distributed? This could be important if different fields have different patterns. For example, in electrical communication (H04), maybe certain phrases are more likely to have high similarity scores because of specific terminology.\n\nBut this would require a cross-tabulation between context and score. Let\'s see if there\'s any previous question about that. The current EDA hasn\'t checked context-specific score distributions yet. Also, the number of unique scores per context might vary. For example, some contexts may have more scores of 1.0, others less.\n\nAlso, another thing: the average length of anchor and target by context. For example, maybe in some contexts, the phrases tend to be longer or shorter.\n\nBut all that can be checked via ask_eda.\n\nAnother thought: the dataset has no overlapping triples, so the model will have to generalize to new anchor, target, context combinations. But that\'s already known.\n\nNow, going back to what the developer might need. According to the supporting baseline notes, many competitors merge title information from the titles.csv to enrich the context with the actual title.\n\nThe current steps so far:\n\n1. Checked train and test structure: no missing values, score distribution.\n2. Downloaded and checked titles.csv, which has title info for CPC codes.\n3. Confirmed all train contexts exist in titles.csv.\n4. Checked unique anchors and targets, their repetition counts.\n5. Checked no overlapping triples between train and test.\n\nNext steps to do:\n\n- Check context-specific score distribution. For example, for each context, what\'s the distribution of scores. Are some contexts more likely to have high scores? Like \'H04\' context may have score 0.75 often because certain terms have synonyms (like \'mobile phone\' vs. \'cellphone\'), which is a common synonym.\n\n- Also, check how the target\'s length varies with context or score.\n\n- Also, maybe check the relationship between context and score. For example, "in which context are the highest scores found?"\n\nAnother tool call could be to merge train.csv with titles.csv on context/code and then check the distribution of scores across the different CPC titles.\n\nBut to do this, first, let\'s see what the titles.csv\'s title column says for a few context codes.

But since in train.csv, each triple is unique (anchor, target, context), to check this, need to find if any (anchor, target) pair appears with different contexts. But looking at the data: unique triples, so if anchor and target are same but context differs, then multiple rows.\n\nWait, the earlier check of unique triples: for train.csv, 32825 unique triples (since total rows is 32825 and was found unique). So each triple is unique. So if (anchor, target, context) repeats, but the data doesn\'t have duplicates. So it\'s possible to have same anchor and target with different contexts.\n\nFor example, anchor "electricity" and target "power" could be in different contexts like \'H04\' and \'G01\', with different scores.\n\nSo this would be a good check. But to find if there are multiple rows with same anchor and target but different contexts.\n\nLet me check how many unique (anchor, target) pairs in train.csv.\n\nWait, from the previous EDA question: for train, unique anchors 733, unique targets 26850. So number of unique (anchor, target) pairs: probably 32825 because each row is unique triple. But maybe some anchor-target pairs repeat in different contexts.\n\nLet\'s check: if we group by anchor and target and count how many times the pair appears. For example, doing:\n\ntrain[[\'anchor\', \'target\']].value_counts().max()\n\nBut previously EDA didn\'t check that. So perhaps a useful next step.\n\nBut according to current data, there are 32k unique triples. So each anchor-target-context triple is unique. Therefore, anchor-target pairs might repeat with different contexts.\n\nSo, how many distinct (anchor, target) pairs are there in train?

If yes, that pair has different scores in different contexts.\n\nSo, count the number of such pairs, and examples.\n\nThis would confirm context matters.\n\nLet\'s call ask_eda with that question.\n\nAlso, another check: what\'s the average score per context (top contexts), to see if context-specific score averages vary significantly.\n\nFor example, average score for context H04, H01, etc.\n\nAnother aspect: the average anchor and target lengths by context (e.g., do medical contexts have longer phrases?).\n\nBut context\'s role in score seems critical.\n\nSo the next step is to check context-specific scores and anchor-target pairs across contexts.\n\nLet\'s do that.', 'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0}]}, {'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_a9aecc67a38047d3a8a4aa54', 'content': 'Top 10 Contexts by Frequency with Statistics:\n================================================================================\n\nContext: H04\n  Total count: 1962\n  Average score: 0.3453\n  Score standard deviation: 0.2675\n  Count of 0.0 scores: 478\n  Count of 0.25 scores: 617\n  Count of 0.5 scores: 562\n  Count of 0.75 scores: 251\n  Count of 1.0 scores: 54\n\nContext: H01\n  Total count: 1956\n  Average score: 0.3613\n  Score standard deviation: 0.2455\n  Count of 0.0 scores: 394\n  Count of 0.25 scores: 572\n  Count of 0.5 scores: 747\n  Count of 0.75 scores: 211\n  Count of 1.0 scores: 32\n\nContext: G01\n  Total count: 1633\n  Average score: 0.3708\n  Score standard deviation: 0.2574\n  Count of 0.0 scores: 355\n  Count of 0.25 scores: 399\n  Count of 0.5 scores: 655\n  Count of 0.75 scores: 183\n  Count of 1.0 scores: 41\n\nContext: A61\n  Total count: 1312\n  Average score: 0.3434\n  Score standard deviation: 0.2442\n  Count of 0.0 scores: 298\n  Count of 0.25 scores: 376\n  Count of 0.5 scores: 512\n  Count of 0.75 scores: 102\n  Count of 1.0 scores: 24\n\nContext: F16\n  Total count: 970\n  Average score: 0.3758\n  Score standard deviation: 0.2613\n  Count of 0.0 scores: 178\n  Count of 0.25 scores: 304\n  Count of 0.5 scores: 362\n  Count of 0.75 scores: 74\n  Count of 1.0 scores: 52\n\nContext: G06\n  Total count: 964\n  Average score: 0.3651\n  Score standard deviation: 0.2362\n  Count of 0.0 scores: 186\n  Count of 0.25 scores: 256\n  Count of 0.5 scores: 430\n  Count of 0.75 scores: 76\n  Count of 1.0 scores: 16\n\nContext: C07\n  Total count: 954\n  Average score: 0.3276\n  Score standard deviation: 0.2361\n  Count of 0.0 scores: 201\n  Count of 0.25 scores: 370\n  Count of 0.5 scores: 277\n  Count of 0.75 scores: 98\n  Count of 1.0 scores: 8\n\nContext: B60\n  Total count: 822\n  Average score: 0.3598\n  Score standard deviation: 0.2676\n  Count of 0.0 scores: 159\n  Count of 0.25 scores: 311\n  Count of 0.5 scores: 226\n  Count of 0.75 scores: 84\n  Count of 1.0 scores: 42\n\nContext: B01\n  Total count: 810\n  Average score: 0.3673\n  Score standard deviation: 0.255\n  Count of 0.0 scores: 149\n  Count of 0.25 scores: 274\n  Count of 0.5 scores: 274\n  Count of 0.75 scores: 84\n  Count of 1.0 scores: 29\n\nContext: G02\n  Total count: 788\n  Average score: 0.381\n  Score standard deviation: 0.2438\n  Count of 0.0 scores: 149\n  Count of 0.25 scores: 188\n  Count of 0.5 scores: 356\n  Count of 0.75 scores: 79\n  Count of 1.0 scores: 16\n\n\nFull Results Table:\n================================================================================\n         average_score  score_std  count_0.0  count_0.25  count_0.5  count_0.75  count_1.0  total_count\ncontext                                                                                                \nH04             0.3453     0.2675        478         617        562         251         54         1962\nH01             0.3613     0.2455        394         572        747         211         32         1956\nG01             0.3708     0.2574        355         399        655         183         41         1633\nA61             0.3434     0.2442        298         376        512         102         24         1312\nF16             0.3758     0.2613        178         304        362          74         52          970\nG06             0.3651     0.2362        186         256        430          76         16          964\nC07             0.3276     0.2361        201         370        277          98          8          954\nB60             0.3598     0.2676        159         311        226          84         42          822\nB01             0.3673     0.2550        149         274        274          84         29          810\nG02             0.3810     0.2438        149         188        356          79         16          788\n'}]
