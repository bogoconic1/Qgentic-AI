You never write production code yourself; instead you uncover how the dataset behaves so the developer can build a winning solution with evidence on hand.\n\nPrimary mandate:\n- Build a deep understanding of the dataset before recommending any modeling steps.\n- Alternate between forming hypotheses and confirming them with the `ask_eda` tool.\n- Do not rely on memory or intuition when data can be inspected.\n\nTooling:\n- `ask_eda(question)` executes Python against the local dataset. Use it to quantify distributions, check data quality, look for leakage, and validate every key assumption.\n\nOperating principles (competition-agnostic):\n1. Start by clarifying the target variable(s), feature space(s), and evaluation metric(s) from the competition description.\n2. Investigate label balance or distribution, missing values, feature ranges, and dataset size.\n3. Examine the structure of the input data (e.g., length distributions, numerical scales, categorical cardinalities, sequence lengths, or image dimensions).\n4. Probe for potential leakage, ordering effects (temporal, spatial, or otherwise), or train/test distribution shifts.\n5. Only stop calling tools once each major recommendation in your final plan cites concrete evidence from tool outputs.\n6. Keep each tool call focused on one hypothesis at a time and follow up if results are inconclusive.\n\nDeliverable:\n- A step-by-step technical plan for the Developer. For every recommendation, reference the dataset insight that motivated it (e.g., “Class distribution is skewed toward label 6 per Tool Run #2; therefore we…”) and highlight remaining risks or unanswered questions.\n\nCompetition Description:\n# Overview\n\n## Description\n\nCan you extract meaning from a large, text-based dataset derived from inventions? Here\'s your chance to do so.\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) offers one of the largest repositories of scientific, technical, and commercial information in the world through its\xa0[Open Data Portal](https://developer.uspto.gov/about-open-data). Patents are a form of\xa0[intellectual property](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/basics/general-information-patents)\xa0granted in exchange for the public disclosure of new and useful inventions. Because patents undergo an intensive\xa0[vetting process](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/InventionCon2020_Understanding_the_Patent_Examination_Process.pdf)\xa0prior to grant, and because the history of U.S. innovation spans over two centuries and 11 million patents, the U.S. patent archives stand as a rare combination of data volume, quality, and diversity.\n\n> "The USPTO serves an American innovation machine that never sleeps by granting patents, registering trademarks, and promoting intellectual property around the globe. The USPTO shares over 200 years\' worth of human ingenuity with the world, from lightbulbs to quantum computers. Combined with creativity from the data science community, USPTO datasets carry unbounded potential to empower AI and ML models that will benefit the progress of science and society at large."\n>\n> --- USPTO Chief Information Officer Jamie Holcombe\n\nIn this competition, you will train your models on a novel semantic similarity dataset to extract relevant information by matching key phrases in patent documents. Determining the semantic similarity between phrases is critically important during the patent search and examination process to determine if an invention has been described before. For example, if one invention claims "television set" and a prior publication describes "TV set", a model would ideally recognize these are the same and assist a patent attorney or examiner in retrieving relevant documents. This extends beyond paraphrase identification; if one invention claims a "strong material" and another uses "steel", that may also be a match. What counts as a "strong material" varies per domain (it may be steel in one domain and ripstop fabric in another, but you wouldn\'t want your parachute made of steel). We have included the Cooperative Patent Classification as the technical domain context as an additional feature to help you disambiguate these situations.\n\nCan you build a model to match phrases in order to extract contextual information, thereby helping the patent community connect the dots between millions of patent documents?\n\n> This is a Code Competition. Refer to\xa0[Code Requirements](https://www.kaggle.com/c/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching/overview/code-requirements)\xa0for details.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on the\xa0[Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient)\xa0between the predicted and actual similarity\xa0`score`s.\n\n## Submission File\n\nFor each\xa0`id`\xa0(representing a pair of phrases) in the test set, you must predict the similarity\xa0`score`.

Kaggle. https://kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching\n\n\n# Data\n\n## Dataset Description\n\nIn this dataset, you are presented pairs of phrases (an\xa0`anchor`\xa0and a\xa0`target`\xa0phrase) and asked to rate how similar they are on a scale from 0 (not at all similar) to 1 (identical in meaning). This challenge differs from a standard semantic similarity task in that similarity has been scored here within a patent\'s\xa0`context`, specifically its\xa0[CPC classification (version 2021.05)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Patent_Classification), which indicates the subject to which the patent relates. For example, while the phrases "bird" and "Cape Cod" may have low semantic similarity in normal language, the likeness of their meaning is much closer if considered in the context of "house".\n\nThis is a code competition, in which you will submit code that will be run against an unseen test set. The unseen test set contains approximately 12k pairs of phrases. A small public test set has been provided for testing purposes, but is not used in scoring.\n\nInformation on the meaning of CPC codes may be found on the\xa0[USPTO website](https://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/cpc/html/cpc.html). The CPC version 2021.05 can be found on the\xa0[CPC archive website](https://www.cooperativepatentclassification.org/Archive).\n\n## Score meanings\n\nThe scores are in the 0-1 range with increments of 0.25 with the following meanings:\n\n- **1.0**\xa0- Very close match. This is typically an exact match except possibly for differences in conjugation, quantity (e.g. singular vs. plural), and addition or removal of stopwords (e.g. "the", "and", "or").\n- **0.75**\xa0- Close synonym, e.g. "mobile phone" vs. "cellphone". This also includes abbreviations, e.g. "TCP" -> "transmission control protocol".\n- **0.5**\xa0- Synonyms which don\'t have the same meaning (same function, same properties). This includes broad-narrow (hyponym) and narrow-broad (hypernym) matches.\n- **0.25**\xa0- Somewhat related, e.g. the two phrases are in the same high level domain but are not synonyms. This also includes antonyms.\n- **0.0**\xa0- Unrelated.\n\nFiles\n-----\n\n- **train.csv**\xa0- the training set, containing phrases, contexts, and their similarity scores\n- **test.csv**\xa0- the test set set, identical in structure to the training set but without the score\n- **sample_submission.csv**\xa0- a sample submission file in the correct format\n\nColumns\n-------\n\n- `id`\xa0- a unique identifier for a pair of phrases\n- `anchor`\xa0- the first phrase\n- `target`\xa0- the second phrase\n- `context`\xa0- the\xa0[CPC classification (version 2021.05)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Patent_Classification), which indicates the subject within which the similarity is to be scored\n- `score`\xa0- the similarity.

If the target is skewed, that could affect model performance. For example, if most scores are around 1.0, then the model might struggle with lower scores. So check the score distribution.\n\nPossible question for ask_eda: "What is the distribution of the \'score\' column in the training data?

What are the unique context codes? How many unique CPC codes are there? Because CPC is the classification, and each context is a code.

The results showed that there are 32,825 rows and 5 columns, and all columns have zero missing values. That\'s good news for data quality—no missing values to handle right away.\n\nNow, I need to start forming hypotheses about the data. The competition is about semantic similarity between phrases in the context of patent CPC classifications. The target variable is \'score\' which ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 in increments of 0.25. Let me think about what the next steps should be.\n\nFirst, I should check the distribution of the scores. Since the evaluation metric is Pearson correlation, understanding the balance of scores is important. If the scores are imbalanced, that might affect how we model it. For example, if most scores are 0.75 or 1.0, the model might just predict that. But also, the classes have specific meanings (like 0.0 is unrelated, 0.25 somewhat related, etc.), so maybe the distribution shows certain classes are more common.\n\nAnother thing to check: the context column. The context is a CPC classification code. We need to know how many unique CPC codes there are, and how they\'re distributed. Also, how many anchor-target pairs per CPC code? Maybe some codes are overrepresented.\n\nThen, looking at the anchor and target phrases. Maybe check their lengths. Are the phrases short or long? What\'s the average length, max, min? Also, maybe the uniqueness of the phrases—how many unique anchors and targets? Are there duplicates in anchor or target? That might affect the model\'s ability to generalize.\n\nAlso, check for any potential data leakage. Since this is a competition with train and test sets, should check if there\'s overlap between train and test in terms of anchors, targets, contexts. But wait, the test set isn\'t available yet, so maybe we can only look at the train data. But how the data was split—whether the test set has similar contexts or phrases. But without test data, maybe we can\'t check leakage directly. However, sometimes the problem might come from the way the train data is structured. For example, if the same anchor appears with different targets but same context and different scores, that could indicate inconsistency, but maybe not leakage.\n\nWait, but the data description says there\'s a public test set provided for testing, but not used in scoring. So perhaps the public test set is part of the provided data, but in reality, for the competition, the actual test is separate. But since we\'re only working on the train data for now, perhaps focus on the train set.\n\nFirst, check the score distribution. Let\'s ask for the distribution of \'score\' in train.csv. Specifically, count of each unique score value and maybe the min, max, mean.\n\nAlso, look at the context codes. How many unique contexts? What\'s the distribution of anchors per context? Maybe check how many rows per unique context. For example, some contexts might have many examples, others few.\n\nSo next step: ask for the distribution of the \'score\' column.\n\nWait, the scores in the data description: increments of 0.25, so possible values are 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0. Let\'s confirm with the data.\n\nAlso, how many unique CPC contexts, and how they are distributed. Maybe ask for the number of unique contexts and count of each context.\n\nAnother point: check if there are duplicate rows in the train data. For example, same anchor, target, context—do they have the same score? If not, that\'s a problem, but probably they should be the same. Or maybe different scores for the same pair but different contexts? Wait, context is part of the data. So for example, if the same anchor and target have different contexts, then the score might differ. But if anchor, target, context are the same but score different, that\'s overlapping data which could indicate issues.\n\nSo maybe check for duplicates across anchor, target, context. If there are duplicates with different scores, that\'s a red flag.\n\nAlso, check the length of anchor and target strings. What\'s the average character length, word count, etc.\n\nSo let\'s structure this. Next steps:\n\n1. Check score distribution (how many in each category).\n2. Check number of unique contexts and their frequencies.\n3. Check for duplicates in anchor, target, context.\n4. Check the length distributions of anchor and target.\n\nAlso, maybe check the text content—like what\'s the most common words in anchors and targets, but maybe that\'s too early. First get the basics.\n\nSo for the first ask_eda call, I checked missing values. Now next ask_eda should be to look at the score distribution.\n\nLet\'s formulate that question.\n\n"Show the count of each unique value in the \'score\' column."\n\nThen, after seeing that, we can proceed to context distribution, etc.\n', 'reasoning_details': [{'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'Okay, so the first thing I checked was the structure of the train.csv file. The results showed that there are 32,825 rows and 5 columns, and all columns have zero missing values. That\'s good news for data quality—no missing values to handle right away.\n\nNow, I need to start forming hypotheses about the data. The competition is about semantic similarity between phrases in the context of patent CPC classifications. The target variable is \'score\' which ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 in increments of 0.25. Let me think about what the next steps should be.\n\nFirst, I should check the distribution of the scores. Since the evaluation metric is Pearson correlation, understanding the balance of scores is important. If the scores are imbalanced, that might affect how we model it. For example, if most scores are 0.75 or 1.0, the model might just predict that. But also, the classes have specific meanings (like 0.0 is unrelated, 0.25 somewhat related, etc.), so maybe the distribution shows certain classes are more common.\n\nAnother thing to check: the context column. The context is a CPC classification code. We need to know how many unique CPC codes there are, and how they\'re distributed. Also, how many anchor-target pairs per CPC code? Maybe some codes are overrepresented.\n\nThen, looking at the anchor and target phrases. Maybe check their lengths. Are the phrases short or long? What\'s the average length, max, min? Also, maybe the uniqueness of the phrases—how many unique anchors and targets? Are there duplicates in anchor or target? That might affect the model\'s ability to generalize.\n\nAlso, check for any potential data leakage. Since this is a competition with train and test sets, should check if there\'s overlap between train and test in terms of anchors, targets, contexts. But wait, the test set isn\'t available yet, so maybe we can only look at the train data. But how the data was split—whether the test set has similar contexts or phrases. But without test data, maybe we can\'t check leakage directly. However, sometimes the problem might come from the way the train data is structured.

The results show that scores are skewed: 0.25 has the highest count (10,306), followed by 0.5 (11,068), then 0.0 (6,774), 0.75 (3,634), and 1.0 (1,043). The frequencies are roughly 20.6%, 31.4%, 33.7%, 11.1%, and 3.2% respectively. So the majority of scores are 0.25 and 0.5, with very few high scores (1.0). This imbalance might matter for modeling. Since the evaluation is Pearson correlation, maybe the model needs to handle the continuous scale well, but the skewness could affect performance if the model doesn\'t capture the rare high scores properly.\n\nNext step: check the context distribution. The context is the CPC code. I need to see how many unique contexts there are and their distribution. Maybe the data is split across contexts, and certain contexts have more samples. Also, the CpcClassification has different levels, maybe knowing how the contexts are structured could help—like if the codes are hierarchical, etc.\n\nWait, the CPC classification is in the context column.

But for EDA, maybe first seeing the unique contexts.\n\nSo current hypotheses: check number of unique contexts. Maybe the data is imbalanced across contexts.

Also check if there\'s a relationship between context and score distribution. For example, maybe certain contexts have more high scores (1.0) because specific phrases are often exact matches in those fields.\n\nAlso, check the length of the anchor and target phrases. Are they short or long? Maybe the average word count or character count. If they are very short, perhaps the model needs to handle very concise phrases.\n\nAnother thing: check if there are duplicates in anchor-target pairs. Maybe same anchor and target across different contexts, or same context but different scores. But since the id is unique, but maybe duplicates across the dataset.\n\nBut wait, each row is a unique id, so the rows themselves are unique. But maybe the same anchor and target combination exists in different contexts, which might affect similarity.\n\nAlso, check for possible leakage. But in this case, the context is provided as part of the input, so maybe when predicting, the context is known. So if during training the context is included, that\'s okay. But potential leakage would be if during the model training, the model can access information from the test set. But given the structure, probably not, since the context is provided for each test row.\n\nBut need to check train and test distributions for context. However, the test set isn\'t available yet. Wait, the problem says the test.csv is provided, but in the data description, "test.csv - the test set set, identical in structure to the training set but without the score". So maybe the test set is available, but in the EDA phase, when the assistant is querying, they can inspect test.csv as well? Wait, but the initial tool calls only asked about train.csv. So maybe next, we should check the test.csv structure as well.\n\nWait, but the initial tool calls were on train.csv. Let me check: in the first call, the question was about train.csv. Then response said train.csv has 32825 rows. So maybe the existing data we have is for train. But for the test set, the user hasn\'t asked yet.

No missing values in any columns. That\'s good, so we don\'t have to handle missing data right away.\n\nNext, the score distribution. The scores are 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0. The counts are: 6,774 (0.0), 10,306 (0.25), 11,068 (0.5), 3,634 (0.75), 1,043 (1.0). So the distribution is skewed. The most frequent is 0.5 (33.72%), followed by 0.25 (31.4%), then 0.0 (20.6%), 0.75 (11.07%), and 1.0 is the least (3.18%). This is important because when evaluating the model, the Pearson correlation is used, but for classification problems with imbalanced classes, sometimes stratification is needed. However, since it\'s a regression task (predicting a continuous score), maybe we need to check if the score variable is continuous or categorical. Wait, the scores are in increments of 0.25 but they are treated as continuous values here. But in the evaluation, it\'s Pearson correlation, so the model needs to predict real numbers.\n\nBut looking at the score distribution, some scores are very rare (like 1.0 is only 3%). That might be a consideration for modeling. However, since it\'s regression, maybe it\'s okay, but the model should be able to handle the low-frequency high scores.\n\nThen, looking at the context column. There are 106 unique contexts. The top 10 contexts are H04, H01, G01, A61, F16, G06, C07, B60, B01, G02. Each of these contexts has different score distributions. For example, H04 has a high number of 0.25 scores (617) and 0.5 (562), but lower 0.0 (478), 0.75 (251), 1.0 (54). So the distribution of scores varies by context.\n\nThis makes sense because the problem statement mentions that the context (CPC classification) is important for disambiguating similarity. For example, "bird" and "Cape Cod" might be similar in the context of "house" but not otherwise. So the context is crucial, and the model probably needs to use that information.\n\nNow, what other things should I check? Let\'s think about the anchor and target columns. Are there any patterns in the text? For example, lengths of anchor and target phrases. Maybe some phrases are very short or very long. Also, do certain contexts have specific characteristics in the anchors and targets?\n\nAlso, looking at the test data: the competition says the test set has approximately 12k pairs. But we don\'t have access to test.csv directly. However, for EDA, we should check if there\'s a distribution shift between train and test. But since we can\'t see test.csv (as per the problem setup), maybe we need to consider that in the plan. But since the tool can only access the local dataset, maybe the test.csv is not available for EDA, only train.csv. Wait, the competition description says "the unseen test set contains approximately 12k pairs", and "a small public test set has been provided for testing purposes, but is not used in scoring". But in the data section, they list train.csv, test.csv, and sample_submission.csv. However, in practical terms, when using the tool, would the test.csv be available? Probably yes, because when you download the data for the competition, you get train.csv and test.csv, but test.csv doesn\'t have score column. However, the tool command might not have access to the test data unless specified. But the user hasn\'t asked about test yet.\n\nWait, in the current process, the user (me) as the lead strategist, is using the ask_eda tool to query the dataset. At this point, I\'ve only checked train.csv. Maybe next step is to check some aspects of anchor and target.\n\nMaybe check the lengths of anchor and target phrases. For example, average lengths, or distribution of word counts in anchor and target.\n\nAnother thing: check if there\'s any leakage. For instance, if the same pair of anchor and target appears in both train and test, but that\'s unlikely since test is unseen. But maybe the context has overlapping values between train and test? Not sure. But since we can\'t see test data yet, maybe just check train data for duplicates or something.\n\nBut the first step is to check the text columns: anchor and target. Let\'s see their lengths.\n\nAlso, check for duplicates in the train dataset. Like, same (anchor, target, context) but different scores? That could indicate a problem.\n\nWait, but before that, check if there are any repeated rows. For example, if two rows have same id, but that\'s unlikely. But the id is unique per pair, so probably no duplicates in id. But for the same anchor, target, context, but different scores? That would be a problem.\n\nBut to check that, we can query: are there duplicate rows in terms of anchor, target, context, but with different scores?\n\nAlso check for unique number of phrases in the anchor and target columns. How many unique anchors? Unique targets? That could help in understanding categorical nature.\n\nAnother thing: how many unique words in the dataset? But maybe that\'s too broad. Maybe start with phrase lengths.\n\nSo next step: ask about the word count distributions for anchor and target.\n\nAlso, check for presence of numerical values in anchor and target (like digits), as seen in the supporting baseline notes they mention a \'num_anchor\' binary feature. So maybe checking if anchor or target contain numbers, how frequent.\n\nAlso, check the context structure. The context is CPC codes (like H04, G06, etc.), and the top 10 contexts as seen. But the top contexts have varying score distributions. For example, H04 is the most frequent context. Let\'s see the total count for H04: in the tool response, for context H04, the counts per score sum to 478+617+562+251+54 = 1962. So H04 has 1962 entries. Similarly, H01 has 394+572+747+211+32 = 1956. So total for top 10 contexts might be significant.\n\nBut perhaps what\'s needed is to see if the same context can have different score distributions. For example, in H04, most scores are 0.25 and 0.5 (617 and 562), whereas for another context, maybe there\'s more high scores.\n\nBut maybe the most important thing now is to check text lengths. Let\'s ask for word count statistics for anchor and target.\n\nSo next tool call: ask_eda about the distribution of word counts in anchor and target columns.\n\nAlso, check for duplicates in the training data. Like same (anchor, target, context) with different scores.\n\nSo possible next steps:\n\n1. Check the word count for anchor and target (mean, median, min, max, quartiles).\n2. Check duplicates for the same anchor, target, context but different scores.\n3. Check if the same anchor or target appears across different contexts, which might affect the model\'s processing.\n\nAlso, maybe check how many unique anchor phrases, unique target phrases, and how many times each are repeated.\n\nFor example, how many unique anchors? Same for target.\n\nLet me structure the next tool calls:\n\nFirst, word count statistics for anchor and target.\n\nSecond, number of unique anchors and targets.\n\nThird, check for duplicates where anchor, target, context are the same but scores differ.\n\nFourth, perhaps check the distribution of contexts across the scores. But maybe that\'s already partially covered by the top context distributions.\n\nBut let\'s proceed step by step.\n\nFirst tool call: word counts for anchor and target.\n\nSecond: unique anchors and targets.\n\nThird: check for duplicate (anchor, target, context) with different scores.\n\nThat should cover key data quality aspects.\n\nOkay, I need to continue investigating the dataset based on the previous tool responses. Let me recap what I have so far.\n\nFrom the first tool call: train.csv has 32,825 rows, 5 columns, no missing values. Good, data quality is clean for missing values.\n\nSecond tool call: score distribution. Scores are from 0.0 to 1.0 in 0.25 increments. Most frequent is 0.5 (33.7%), followed by 0.25 (31.4%), 0.0 (20.6%), 0.75 (11.1%), 1.0 (3.2%). So the score distribution is skewed, with very few 1.0 scores. That\'s important for modeling, especially since Pearson correlation is the metric. The model needs to handle this skewness, but since it\'s a regression problem, maybe the distribution isn\'t too problematic, but we should be cautious about the low-frequency high scores.\n\nThird tool call: context column has 106 unique values, top 10 contexts (H04, H01, G01, etc.) with their score distributions. For example, H04\'s scores are spread across all levels but with most at 0.25 and 0.5. This shows that context affects the score distribution, which makes sense as per the competition description—context is critical for disambiguation.\n\nNow, next steps should focus on the text features: anchor and target. Let\'s think about what else to check.\n\n1. Word count distributions for anchor and target. How long are these phrases typically? Maybe average words, max length, etc. This is important for modeling because transformer models have sequence length limits, and knowing the distribution helps in setting appropriate max_length for padding/truncation.\n\n2. Number of unique anchor and target phrases. Maybe there are many repeated anchors or targets, but different contexts. For example, same anchor with different targets and contexts. This could affect how the model processes the data points.\n\n3. Check if there are duplicate entries in the data where anchor, target, and context are identical but scores differ. That would indicate an issue in the data labeling.\n\n4. Check presence of digits or special characters in anchor/target. The supporting baseline mentions a \'num_anchor\' feature, so maybe checking if numbers are present in anchors could be useful.\n\n5. Also, check the length of the context codes. Since CPC codes have a structure (e.g., H04, G06), but maybe the CPC codes as given are just the codes (like "H04"), but the supporting baseline notes mention merging with external CPC titles. So perhaps the context column is just the CPC codes (like \'H04\'), and there\'s a separate source for the actual descriptions. So maybe we need to check if the context is just the code and whether there\'s a need to map them to descriptions.\n\nBut the current data for context is the CPC code, so the actual description isn\'t in the train.csv. So maybe in the data preprocessing step, we need to merge with an external CPC description file. But for EDA, maybe check the structure of the context codes (e.g., their length, format). But the tool response for unique contexts listed them as H04, H01, etc., which are short codes (like 3 characters, maybe 2-4 characters). But this may not be necessary to check unless it affects feature engineering.\n\nLet me proceed with the next tool calls.\n\nFirst, check word count distributions for anchor and target. I\'ll ask for average, min, max, percentiles.\n\nSecond, number of unique anchors and unique targets.\n\nThird, check for duplicate (anchor, target, context) rows with different scores.\n\nFourth, perhaps check the frequency of digits in anchor and target, or check if any anchors/targets have numeric characters.\n\nLet me craft those tool calls.\n\nFor word count: ask for statistics on the number of words in anchor and target. So "What is the distribution of word counts in the \'anchor\' and \'target\' columns? Include mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles."\n\nFor unique counts: "How many unique anchor phrases and unique target phrases are in the dataset?"\n\nFor duplicates: "Check for duplicate rows where anchor, target, and context are identical but score differs. List the number of such duplicate sets and their scores."\n\nCheck for numeric characters: "Count how many anchor and target phrases contain digits (0-9) and the average number of digits per phrase."\n\nThese are specific, focused questions that can give concrete insights.\n\nSo first, check word count distributions for anchor and target.\n', 'reasoning_details': [{'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'Okay, let\'s start by understanding the data based on the tool responses I\'ve received so far.\n\nFirst, the dataset structure: train.csv has 32,825 rows and 5 columns (id, anchor, target, context, score). No missing values in any columns. That\'s good, so we don\'t have to handle missing data right away.\n\nNext, the score distribution. The scores are 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0. The counts are: 6,774 (0.0), 10,306 (0.25), 11,068 (0.5), 3,634 (0.75), 1,043 (1.0). So the distribution is skewed. The most frequent is 0.5 (33.72%), followed by 0.25 (31.4%), then 0.0 (20.6%), 0.75 (11.07%), and 1.0 is the least (3.18%). This is important because when evaluating the model, the Pearson correlation is used, but for classification problems with imbalanced classes, sometimes stratification is needed. However, since it\'s a regression task (predicting a continuous score), maybe we need to check if the score variable is continuous or categorical. Wait, the scores are in increments of 0.25 but they are treated as continuous values here. But in the evaluation, it\'s Pearson correlation, so the model needs to predict real numbers.\n\nBut looking at the score distribution, some scores are very rare (like 1.0 is only 3%). That might be a consideration for modeling. However, since it\'s regression, maybe it\'s okay, but the model should be able to handle the low-frequency high scores.\n\nThen, looking at the context column. There are 106 unique contexts. The top 10 contexts are H04, H01, G01, A61, F16, G06, C07, B60, B01, G02. Each of these contexts has different score distributions. For example, H04 has a high number of 0.25 scores (617) and 0.5 (562), but lower 0.0 (478), 0.75 (251), 1.0 (54). So the distribution of scores varies by context.\n\nThis makes sense because the problem statement mentions that the context (CPC classification) is important for disambiguating similarity. For example, "bird" and "Cape Cod" might be similar in the context of "house" but not otherwise. So the context is crucial, and the model probably needs to use that information.\n\nNow, what other things should I check? Let\'s think about the anchor and target columns. Are there any patterns in the text? For example, lengths of anchor and target phrases. Maybe some phrases are very short or very long. Also, do certain contexts have specific characteristics in the anchors and targets?\n\nAlso, looking at the test data: the competition says the test set has approximately 12k pairs. But we don\'t have access to test.csv directly. However, for EDA, we should check if there\'s a distribution shift between train and test. But since we can\'t see test.csv (as per the problem setup), maybe we need to consider that in the plan. But since the tool can only access the local dataset, maybe the test.csv is not available for EDA, only train.csv. Wait, the competition description says "the unseen test set contains approximately 12k pairs", and "a small public test set has been provided for testing purposes, but is not used in scoring". But in the data section, they list train.csv, test.csv, and sample_submission.csv. However, in practical terms, when using the tool, would the test.csv be available? Probably yes, because when you download the data for the competition, you get train.csv and test.csv, but test.csv doesn\'t have score column.

At this point, I\'ve only checked train.csv. Maybe next step is to check some aspects of anchor and target.\n\nMaybe check the lengths of anchor and target phrases. For example, average lengths, or distribution of word counts in anchor and target.\n\nAnother thing: check if there\'s any leakage. For instance, if the same pair of anchor and target appears in both train and test, but that\'s unlikely since test is unseen. But maybe the context has overlapping values between train and test? Not sure. But since we can\'t see test data yet, maybe just check train data for duplicates or something.\n\nBut the first step is to check the text columns: anchor and target.

That could indicate a problem.\n\nWait, but before that, check if there are any repeated rows. For example, if two rows have same id, but that\'s unlikely. But the id is unique per pair, so probably no duplicates in id. But for the same anchor, target, context, but different scores? That would be a problem.\n\nBut to check that, we can query: are there duplicate rows in terms of anchor, target, context, but with different scores?\n\nAlso check for unique number of phrases in the anchor and target columns. How many unique anchors? Unique targets? That could help in understanding categorical nature.\n\nAnother thing: how many unique words in the dataset? But maybe that\'s too broad. Maybe start with phrase lengths.\n\nSo next step: ask about the word count distributions for anchor and target.\n\nAlso, check for presence of numerical values in anchor and target (like digits), as seen in the supporting baseline notes they mention a \'num_anchor\' binary feature. So maybe checking if anchor or target contain numbers, how frequent.\n\nAlso, check the context structure. The context is CPC codes (like H04, G06, etc.), and the top 10 contexts as seen. But the top contexts have varying score distributions. For example, H04 is the most frequent context. Let\'s see the total count for H04: in the tool response, for context H04, the counts per score sum to 478+617+562+251+54 = 1962. So H04 has 1962 entries. Similarly, H01 has 394+572+747+211+32 = 1956. So total for top 10 contexts might be significant.\n\nBut perhaps what\'s needed is to see if the same context can have different score distributions. For example, in H04, most scores are 0.25 and 0.5 (617 and 562), whereas for another context, maybe there\'s more high scores.\n\nBut maybe the most important thing now is to check text lengths. Let\'s ask for word count statistics for anchor and target.\n\nSo next tool call: ask_eda about the distribution of word counts in anchor and target columns.\n\nAlso, check for duplicates in the training data.

I need to figure out the next steps based on the current EDA results. Let me recap what we have so far.\n\nFirst, the dataset has 32,825 rows with no missing values in any columns. That\'s good—clean data in terms of completeness. The score distribution shows that 0.5 is the most common, followed by 0.25, then 0.0, 0.75, and 1.0 is the rarest. So the labels are imbalanced, especially with 1.0 being quite rare. The top contexts like H04, H01, G01, etc., have varying score distributions. For example, H04 has more 0.0 and 0.25, but also some 1.0s. But maybe I should check if certain contexts have specific score patterns.\n\nWord counts for anchor and target are mostly around 2 words, with some variation. Target has a max of 15 words, but that\'s probably an outlier. Anchor\'s max is 5 words. So most phrases are short, maybe single or two words. That\'s important for tokenization—maybe the model needs to handle very short texts.\n\nWait, but the next step is to check for possible leakage or distribution shifts between train and test. But we don\'t have the test data yet. Wait, the user mentioned "a small public test set has been provided for testing purposes, but is not used in scoring." But maybe for this EDA, the available data is only train.csv and maybe test.csv? Wait, the problem statement says "train.csv" and "test.csv" are part of the dataset. But when the assistant called ask_eda, do we have access to the test data? Wait, looking at the tool\'s capabilities, the \'ask_eda\' function can execute against the local dataset. So assuming the current dataset includes both train and test, but in the first tool call, it was about train.csv.\n\nBut perhaps in this competition, the test data is separate. However, in the EDA step, when checking for leakage, we need to check if the train and test distributions are similar. But how?\n\nWait, the user\'s current state is that they\'ve done some EDA on train.csv: counts, score distribution, context frequency, word counts. Next step could be to check if there\'s any leakage between anchor and target. For example, maybe the anchor and target are sometimes the same, which might cause leakage.\n\nWait, another thing: sometimes in text datasets, if the target contains the anchor or vice versa, that could be a leakage. But given the problem is about semantic similarity, maybe they are supposed to be related, but if they are exact matches, that\'s part of the task. But the score for identical would be 1.0. But if the model can just match the anchor to target exactly and get high score, that\'s okay. But the question is whether the dataset has instances where anchor and target are the same string. Let me check that. For example, user could ask: how many rows have anchor == target exactly.\n\nBecause if there are exact matches, then those would have score 1.0. Let\'s see. So if anchor equals target, the score should be 1.0. But maybe there\'s cases where anchor equals target but the score is less than 1.0? That would be a data issue. Or maybe some exact matches are scored as 1.0.\n\nWait, let\'s think. If anchor == target exactly, the score should be 1.0. Let me check if there are cases where anchor == target but score is not 1.0. That could be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps some entries where anchor and target are the same but score is lower. That would be an error in data, which could be a leakage if the model can exploit that. But maybe in the data, when they are the same, the score is indeed 1.0. Let\'s check that.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the anchor or target have special characters or case differences. When checking exact equality, maybe the strings are identical when lowercased. So maybe the user should check for exact string equality and then if the score is 1.0.\n\nWait, the task says score 1.0 is "very close match, typically exact match except for conjugation, quantity, stopwords". So exact string match should be 1.0. But the data might have cases where anchor and target are same or differ in small ways but still score 1.0. But to check leakage, perhaps if the anchor or target are too similar in the data such that the model can just look for string match and predict score. But in this case, the model should be learning semantic similarity, not exact string matching, but perhaps exact matches are a part of it.\n\nBut to check for leakage, perhaps the training and test data have overlapping anchor or target phrases. But since we don\'t have the test data yet, maybe the first step is to check if the train dataset has duplicates.\n\nWait, but the competition\'s test set is unseen, so as long as there\'s no overlapping in the ids or something, but the actual phrases might be similar. But how to check for leakage? Maybe check if anchor or target in test can be found in train\'s anchor or target, but without test data, perhaps I can\'t. But the user has only the train data so far. Wait, but the user provided a call for train.csv\'s info. Maybe they have the test data available, but the initial EDA was only on train. So maybe the next step is to check the test data\'s size and structure compared to train.\n\nWait, but the previous tool calls only used the train data. So to check for data shift between train and test, I need to look at the test data. Let\'s see. So next step: get the number of rows in test.csv, check for missing values, similar statistics as train. Then check if the distribution of scores for train vs test (but test doesn\'t have scores), so maybe check the distribution of contexts and word counts in test to see if similar to train.\n\nBut the user may need to check the test data structure. Alternatively, maybe the \'context\' in test has similar distribution to train. Also check if the target and anchor word count distributions are similar.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the test data, the contexts may include some not present in train. Similarly, anchor or target phrases not seen in training.\n\nBut since the user\'s current step is to gather data insights, next step is to check the test data\'s structure. So call ask_eda on test.csv.\n\nFirst, perhaps the steps should be: check test data row count, check missing values, check score (but test doesn\'t have score), check contexts, word counts, etc.\n\nWait, but test.csv doesn\'t have score column. So the columns are id, anchor, target, context (since the description says "identical in structure to training set but without the score"), so yes, test.csv has same columns except no score.\n\nSo perhaps next step is to run ask_eda on test.csv to get its structure.\n\nSo first tool call: check test data size, missing values, contexts count etc.\n\nWait, user did not check test data yet. So next step should be to check test dataset details.\n\nSo let\'s do:\n\nWhat\'s the row count and columns for test.csv? Missing values?\n\nAlso check the contexts in test and their distribution. Compare to train\'s contexts to see if there are new contexts in test.\n\nBut wait, if the test has contexts not seen in train, that\'s a problem. Otherwise, if contexts are overlapping.\n\nAnother possible thing: check the anchor and target word counts in test. Compare to train\'s stats. Are they similar?\n\nSo next tool call: for test.csv, log size, missing values. Then the contexts\' top 10 and their counts, word counts for anchor and target.\n\nBut since the current session shows the last tool call was about word counts for train\'s anchor and target, now maybe ask about test.csv.\n\nBut since the tool only accepts a question string, perhaps:\n\n"what is the number of rows and columns in test.csv? for each column (id, anchor, target, context), what is the count of missing values? Also show the top 10 contexts in test and their count."\n\nThen also the word count stats for anchor and target.\n\nBut the previous calls have been for train only. So the next step is to get test data information.\n\nAlternatively, check if there\'s any overlap between train and test in terms of id? Probably not, since test ids are different. But sometimes competitions have duplicate ids between train and test, but unlikely.\n\nBut more importantly, check if the contexts in test are same as in train. Because if it\'s a new context, the model might not have seen it before, which could be problematic. So checking for overlapping contexts.\n\nSo next step: compare train and test contexts.\n\nBut for that, first get test context details.\n\nSo the next tool call should check test.csv structure.\n\nLet me form the question.\n\n"Check the number of rows and columns in test.csv. For each column in test.csv (id, anchor, target, context), count missing values. Then, what are the number of unique contexts in test.csv and the top 10 contexts by frequency. Also provide the word count statistics for anchor and target in test.csv."\n\nWait, the question can be structured as follows for ask_eda.\n\nYes.\n\nSo let\'s proceed to ask that.\n', 'reasoning_details': [{'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'Okay, let\'s see. I need to figure out the next steps based on the current EDA results. Let me recap what we have so far.\n\nFirst, the dataset has 32,825 rows with no missing values in any columns. That\'s good—clean data in terms of completeness. The score distribution shows that 0.5 is the most common, followed by 0.25, then 0.0, 0.75, and 1.0 is the rarest. So the labels are imbalanced, especially with 1.0 being quite rare. The top contexts like H04, H01, G01, etc., have varying score distributions. For example, H04 has more 0.0 and 0.25, but also some 1.0s. But maybe I should check if certain contexts have specific score patterns.\n\nWord counts for anchor and target are mostly around 2 words, with some variation. Target has a max of 15 words, but that\'s probably an outlier. Anchor\'s max is 5 words. So most phrases are short, maybe single or two words. That\'s important for tokenization—maybe the model needs to handle very short texts.\n\nWait, but the next step is to check for possible leakage or distribution shifts between train and test. But we don\'t have the test data yet. Wait, the user mentioned "a small public test set has been provided for testing purposes, but is not used in scoring." But maybe for this EDA, the available data is only train.csv and maybe test.csv? Wait, the problem statement says "train.csv" and "test.csv" are part of the dataset. But when the assistant called ask_eda, do we have access to the test data? Wait, looking at the tool\'s capabilities, the \'ask_eda\' function can execute against the local dataset. So assuming the current dataset includes both train and test, but in the first tool call, it was about train.csv.\n\nBut perhaps in this competition, the test data is separate. However, in the EDA step, when checking for leakage, we need to check if the train and test distributions are similar. But how?\n\nWait, the user\'s current state is that they\'ve done some EDA on train.csv: counts, score distribution, context frequency, word counts. Next step could be to check if there\'s any leakage between anchor and target. For example, maybe the anchor and target are sometimes the same, which might cause leakage.\n\nWait, another thing: sometimes in text datasets, if the target contains the anchor or vice versa, that could be a leakage. But given the problem is about semantic similarity, maybe they are supposed to be related, but if they are exact matches, that\'s part of the task. But the score for identical would be 1.0. But if the model can just match the anchor to target exactly and get high score, that\'s okay. But the question is whether the dataset has instances where anchor and target are the same string. Let me check that. For example, user could ask: how many rows have anchor == target exactly.\n\nBecause if there are exact matches, then those would have score 1.0. Let\'s see. So if anchor equals target, the score should be 1.0. But maybe there\'s cases where anchor equals target but the score is less than 1.0? That would be a data issue. Or maybe some exact matches are scored as 1.0.\n\nWait, let\'s think. If anchor == target exactly, the score should be 1.0. Let me check if there are cases where anchor == target but score is not 1.0. That could be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps some entries where anchor and target are the same but score is lower. That would be an error in data, which could be a leakage if the model can exploit that. But maybe in the data, when they are the same, the score is indeed 1.0. Let\'s check that.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the anchor or target have special characters or case differences. When checking exact equality, maybe the strings are identical when lowercased. So maybe the user should check for exact string equality and then if the score is 1.0.\n\nWait, the task says score 1.0 is "very close match, typically exact match except for conjugation, quantity, stopwords". So exact string match should be 1.0. But the data might have cases where anchor and target are same or differ in small ways but still score 1.0. But to check leakage, perhaps if the anchor or target are too similar in the data such that the model can just look for string match and predict score. But in this case, the model should be learning semantic similarity, not exact string matching, but perhaps exact matches are a part of it.\n\nBut to check for leakage, perhaps the training and test data have overlapping anchor or target phrases. But since we don\'t have the test data yet, maybe the first step is to check if the train dataset has duplicates.\n\nWait, but the competition\'s test set is unseen, so as long as there\'s no overlapping in the ids or something, but the actual phrases might be similar. But how to check for leakage? Maybe check if anchor or target in test can be found in train\'s anchor or target, but without test data, perhaps I can\'t. But the user has only the train data so far. Wait, but the user provided a call for train.csv\'s info. Maybe they have the test data available, but the initial EDA was only on train. So maybe the next step is to check the test data\'s size and structure compared to train.\n\nWait, but the previous tool calls only used the train data. So to check for data shift between train and test, I need to look at the test data. Let\'s see. So next step: get the number of rows in test.csv, check for missing values, similar statistics as train. Then check if the distribution of scores for train vs test (but test doesn\'t have scores), so maybe check the distribution of contexts and word counts in test to see if similar to train.\n\nBut the user may need to check the test data structure. Alternatively, maybe the \'context\' in test has similar distribution to train. Also check if the target and anchor word count distributions are similar.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the test data, the contexts may include some not present in train. Similarly, anchor or target phrases not seen in training.\n\nBut since the user\'s current step is to gather data insights, next step is to check the test data\'s structure. So call ask_eda on test.csv.\n\nFirst, perhaps the steps should be: check test data row count, check missing values, check score (but test doesn\'t have score), check contexts, word counts, etc.\n\nWait, but test.csv doesn\'t have score column. So the columns are id, anchor, target, context (since the description says "identical in structure to training set but without the score"), so yes, test.csv has same columns except no score.\n\nSo perhaps next step is to run ask_eda on test.csv to get its structure.\n\nSo first tool call: check test data size, missing values, contexts count etc.\n\nWait, user did not check test data yet. So next step should be to check test dataset details.\n\nSo let\'s do:\n\nWhat\'s the row count and columns for test.csv? Missing values?\n\nAlso check the contexts in test and their distribution. Compare to train\'s contexts to see if there are new contexts in test.\n\nBut wait, if the test has contexts not seen in train, that\'s a problem. Otherwise, if contexts are overlapping.\n\nAnother possible thing: check the anchor and target word counts in test. Compare to train\'s stats. Are they similar?\n\nSo next tool call: for test.csv, log size, missing values. Then the contexts\' top 10 and their counts, word counts for anchor and target.\n\nBut since the current session shows the last tool call was about word counts for train\'s anchor and target, now maybe ask about test.csv.\n\nBut since the tool only accepts a question string, perhaps:\n\n"what is the number of rows and columns in test.csv? for each column (id, anchor, target, context), what is the count of missing values? Also show the top 10 contexts in test and their count."\n\nThen also the word count stats for anchor and target.\n\nBut the previous calls have been for train only. So the next step is to get test data information.\n\nAlternatively, check if there\'s any overlap between train and test in terms of id? Probably not, since test ids are different. But sometimes competitions have duplicate ids between train and test, but unlikely.\n\nBut more importantly, check if the contexts in test are same as in train.

For each column in test.csv (id, anchor, target, context), count missing values. Then, what are the number of unique contexts in test.csv and the top 10 contexts by frequency.

I need to build a step-by-step technical plan for the developer based on the EDA results so far. Let\'s go through each piece of data we have.\n\nFirst, the train data has 32,825 rows and test has 3,648. No missing values in any columns, which is good. Score distribution: 0.5 is the most common (33.7%), followed by 0.25 (31.4%), then 0.0 (20.6%), 0.75 (11%), and 1.0 (3.2%). So it\'s a bit skewed but not extremely. The classes are imbalanced, especially the 1.0 scores which are rare (only ~3%). That might be a problem for the model to learn those cases well.\n\nContexts: there are 106 unique contexts in train. The top ones are H04, H01, G01, A61, etc. Looking at the score distributions per context, they vary. For example, H04 has a lot of 0.25 and 0.5 scores. H01 has more 0.5s. But in some contexts, like H04, there\'s a decent 0.0 count. So the context matters because different CPC codes might have different score distributions. That\'s important because maybe we need to consider context when building features.\n\nWord counts for anchor and target: both have mean around 2.18 and 2.17, median 2. Max for anchor is 5, target up to 15. So most phrases are short, which makes sense for patent phrases. But target has longer tails (max 15). So maybe some targets are multi-word. So text length isn\'t very long, which is good for transformers that can handle shorter sequences.\n\nTest set has the same number of unique contexts (106), top 10 similar to train. So the context distribution between train and test seems similar, which is good. No data shift in contexts. Word counts in test for anchor and target are similar to train (means 2.18, 2.16), which suggests consistency in data structure.\n\nBut wait, there\'s a potential issue: the score distribution in test isn\'t provided. The test data doesn\'t have scores, so we don\'t know. But the top contexts in test are similar to train. So the contexts are possibly similar, but maybe the score distribution could be different. But since we don\'t have test scores, maybe we can\'t check that directly. But the train and test context frequencies are similar. Let\'s see: in train, top contexts like H04 (which was 478+617+562+251+54= 1962 total in train context H04, but the actual count of rows for H04 would be 1962. The top 10 contexts in train: looking at the top 10 from the EDA, the counts per context. For example, H04 had 478+617+562+251+54 = 1962 rows. Similarly for H01: 394+572+747+211+32=1956. So the top contexts have around 1900-2000 rows each in train.\n\nIn test, H01 has 230 occurrences, H04 215, etc. So in test, H01 and H04 are the most frequent. Train\'s H01 and H04 are the top. So seems like context distribution is similar between train and test. So maybe no major distribution shift in contexts.\n\nBut what about the score distribution in train vs test? Since test doesn\'t have scores, we can\'t check. But maybe we can infer from the context frequencies. If the top contexts in train have similar score distributions, then maybe the test scores will be as well. However, since we can\'t confirm, maybe have to assume potential shift in scores, but context seems similar.\n\nNow, checking for leakage. Are there any instances where the anchor and target are from the same context? Wait, context is part of the data, so each row has an anchor, target, context. The context is part of the row\'s own data. So when building features, maybe the context should be included as input.\n\nLooking at the supporting baseline notes: they mention merging CPC titles. So the context codes (like H01) are codes, and there\'s a separate CPC titles file. So maybe the context is like a code, but the actual description is in another dataset. So the current context column is the code (e.g., H04), but we need to get the corresponding title from CPC archive to get the textual description. The EDA hasn\'t checked if the code has a title yet. So we need to check if the context is just the code, and other data is needed to get the title. The competition description says "context is the CPC classification (version 2021.05)", and there\'s a note in the data description: \'Information on the meaning of CPC codes may be found on the USPTO website. The CPC version 2021.05 can be found on the CPC archive website.\' So the context column is just the code, like \'H04\', but the actual description of the CPC category (like \'Electric communications\') might be in another dataset. So the baseline notes mention merging test dataframe with CPC titles using \'context\' column. So perhaps the context codes need to be mapped to their descriptions.\n\nSo possible next step: check if the context code has a corresponding description. Maybe the EDA needs to check if the context code is sufficient or if we need external data. But the EDA tool can\'t access external data unless it\'s part of the dataset. But in this case, the train.csv doesn\'t have the CPC titles; it\'s a separate file. So the EDA might not have processed that yet. Wait, the problem says "the dataset includes train.csv, test.csv, etc. But maybe the CPC titles are in another file, but the competition provided data might include them. Looking at the data description: \'Files: train.csv, test.csv, sample_submission.csv\'. So maybe CPC titles are in a separate file, but perhaps they are in the public data. But the EDA tool can only check what\'s in the provided CSVs. Wait, but in the current EDA, we only looked at train.csv and test.csv. The CPC code descriptions are probably in a separate file like \'cpc_codes.csv\' or similar. But the user didn\'t mention that. The problem says "the context is the CPC classification", but the context column in train.csv is the code (like H04), but to get the actual title, you might need to map it to another source. So the current data doesn\'t include the titles, just the codes. So when processing, the developer needs to load CPC titles from external data. But the problem states that "freely & publicly available external data is allowed", so the code can load that.\n\nSo the next thing to check is whether the context codes are from a standard CPC code list, and how to get their descriptions. But since the EDA tool can\'t access external files (unless the tool is allowed to do so, but in our case, the ask_eda tool is limited to analyzing the datasets that are part of the competition\'s provided files). So perhaps the current context column is the code, and we need to check the type of the context column. Let\'s see: the context column in the current EDA is analyzed for unique counts. But the actual data structure for context: is it alphanumeric codes? Let\'s check the type. Wait, the previous EDA showed that in train, context has 106 unique values. So the context codes are like \'H04\', \'H01\', etc. So the context is a string of letters and numbers, like CPC codes.\n\nSo the next step could be to check the actual content of the context column. For example, run a query to see the first few entries of context to check what they look like. But maybe the user has already considered that, but to confirm, let\'s check. But maybe the next question could be: what are the first 5 entries of context in train.csv. But let\'s see if the current information is sufficient.\n\nMore importantly, about the anchor and target: word counts are short. For example, anchor maximum 5 words, target up to 15. So most phrases are very short. So the input to model is short text + context. But the current context is a code, not the description. So perhaps we need to get the CPC title description to include as part of the input. For example, the context code \'A61\' might have a description like \'Surgery; Medical or dental devices\'. Including that description would be helpful for the model to understand the context better.\n\nSo for the model to understand that \'A61\' means \'Surgery\', etc., maybe we need to append that description to the context. So first, need to check if the context codes can be mapped to descriptions. If yes, then merge with CPC titles data. So maybe a question to ask_eda: "What are examples of context codes and their corresponding descriptions from an external CPC definitions file?" But since the tool can\'t access external data, perhaps we need to do this in reality, but for EDA purposes, the current context codes are just codes. So the next step is to confirm that external CPC code descriptions are needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the data description it\'s mentioned that there\'s a CPC titles CSV or something. Let\'s check the data description again: \'Files: train.csv, test.csv, sample_submission.csv\'. So no CPC titles file. So the developer has to get the CPC titles from somewhere else. For example, from USPTO\'s website or another resource, maybe the policies mention that. So the developer needs to download that external data. For example, "CPC version 2021.05" is available at the CPC archive website. So the team needs to download that and process it.\n\nBut for the purpose of EDA, we can\'t check that yet. But we can hypothesize that context codes need to be expanded into textual descriptions.\n\nAlso, looking at the scores: 0.0, 0.25, etc. The evaluation is Pearson correlation. So we don\'t need to transform the scores, as we\'re predicting continuous scores. However, the target scores are discrete (in 0.25 increments), so perhaps some post-processing to map to those discrete values would help. But maybe the model can learn that. Also, since there\'s a small number of 1.0 scores, we might want to stratify by score bins during cross-validation to ensure that all score levels are represented.\n\nNow, checking for leakage: could the anchor and target have overlapping information? Like, if the anchor contains the target, or vice versa. For example, if anchor is \'voltage\' and target is \'voltage\', would that always be score 1.0? But not necessarily; maybe context matters. But if the target appears in the anchor as a substring, that\'s a strong signal. So perhaps we should check if anchor and target have exact matches. Let\'s see.\n\nBut the current EDA hasn\'t checked for exact matches. So next step: check for exact matches between anchor and target. How many pairs have anchor == target? And what are their scores?\n\nSimilarly, check for substring overlaps, or other similarities. This could be a leakage if the model uses the exact match as a trivial feature. So if the dataset is constructed such that the same anchor and target are always paired, but in test data, maybe same anchor and target exist, but also varying.\n\nWait, but in the competition, the pairs are made such that anchor and target may or may not be same. Let\'s check how many pairs have anchor == target.\n\nPossible next ask_eda question: "What is the count of rows where anchor == target in train.csv, and what are the corresponding score distributions for those rows?"\n\nAnother check: what\'s the correlation between anchor and target\'s word count? Probably not, but maybe not important.\n\nAlso, check if context is the same across different pairs. But we already checked context frequencies.\n\nAnother thing: the input is anchor, target, context. But context is a code. So when building the model, the context code may need to be expanded to its textual description. So perhaps we need to check if the context codes can be looked up and extended.\n\nBut in the absence of external data, possible next step is to note that context codes need to be mapped to descriptions. However, for now, perhaps the only idea is that context is a code, but for the model to understand better, we need to include the CPC title.\n\nBut maybe in the training data, there\'s a CPC titles mapping. But since it\'s not in train.csv, the developer must process it. So the EDA currently doesn\'t have that in the dataset, so the developer has to handle that.\n\nNow, the question for the developer\'s plan:\n\n1. Need to handle CPC code descriptions. So we should include merging the CPC descriptions from external data.\n\n2. Score distribution is imbalanced, especially 1.0 scores. So need to check if cross-validation should stratify by score bin to ensure all classes are represented.\n\n3. Check for exact matches between anchor and target. Like anchor == target. How many such cases, and their scores. For example, if 1.0 scores often have anchor == target, that\'s a clue that exact matches have high scores. But that\'s easy to check.\n\nLet me see: what\'s the count of anchor == target. Let\'s ask.\n\nNext question: "What is the count of rows in train.csv where anchor is exactly equal to target, and how are their scores distributed?"\n', 'reasoning_details': [{'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'Okay, let\'s see.

The top 10 contexts in train: looking at the top 10 from the EDA, the counts per context. For example, H04 had 478+617+562+251+54 = 1962 rows. Similarly for H01: 394+572+747+211+32=1956. So the top contexts have around 1900-2000 rows each in train.\n\nIn test, H01 has 230 occurrences, H04 215, etc. So in test, H01 and H04 are the most frequent. Train\'s H01 and H04 are the top. So seems like context distribution is similar between train and test. So maybe no major distribution shift in contexts.\n\nBut what about the score distribution in train vs test? Since test doesn\'t have scores, we can\'t check. But maybe we can infer from the context frequencies. If the top contexts in train have similar score distributions, then maybe the test scores will be as well. However, since we can\'t confirm, maybe have to assume potential shift in scores, but context seems similar.\n\nNow, checking for leakage. Are there any instances where the anchor and target are from the same context? Wait, context is part of the data, so each row has an anchor, target, context. The context is part of the row\'s own data. So when building features, maybe the context should be included as input.\n\nLooking at the supporting baseline notes: they mention merging CPC titles. So the context codes (like H01) are codes, and there\'s a separate CPC titles file. So maybe the context is like a code, but the actual description is in another dataset. So the current context column is the code (e.g., H04), but we need to get the corresponding title from CPC archive to get the textual description. The EDA hasn\'t checked if the code has a title yet. So we need to check if the context is just the code, and other data is needed to get the title. The competition description says "context is the CPC classification (version 2021.05)", and there\'s a note in the data description: \'Information on the meaning of CPC codes may be found on the USPTO website. The CPC version 2021.05 can be found on the CPC archive website.\' So the context column is just the code, like \'H04\', but the actual description of the CPC category (like \'Electric communications\') might be in another dataset. So the baseline notes mention merging test dataframe with CPC titles using \'context\' column. So perhaps the context codes need to be mapped to their descriptions.\n\nSo possible next step: check if the context code has a corresponding description. Maybe the EDA needs to check if the context code is sufficient or if we need external data. But the EDA tool can\'t access external data unless it\'s part of the dataset. But in this case, the train.csv doesn\'t have the CPC titles; it\'s a separate file. So the EDA might not have processed that yet. Wait, the problem says "the dataset includes train.csv, test.csv, etc. But maybe the CPC titles are in another file, but the competition provided data might include them. Looking at the data description: \'Files: train.csv, test.csv, sample_submission.csv\'. So maybe CPC titles are in a separate file, but perhaps they are in the public data. But the EDA tool can only check what\'s in the provided CSVs. Wait, but in the current EDA, we only looked at train.csv and test.csv. The CPC code descriptions are probably in a separate file like \'cpc_codes.csv\' or similar. But the user didn\'t mention that. The problem says "the context is the CPC classification", but the context column in train.csv is the code (like H04), but to get the actual title, you might need to map it to another source. So the current data doesn\'t include the titles, just the codes. So when processing, the developer needs to load CPC titles from external data. But the problem states that "freely & publicly available external data is allowed", so the code can load that.\n\nSo the next thing to check is whether the context codes are from a standard CPC code list, and how to get their descriptions. But since the EDA tool can\'t access external files (unless the tool is allowed to do so, but in our case, the ask_eda tool is limited to analyzing the datasets that are part of the competition\'s provided files). So perhaps the current context column is the code, and we need to check the type of the context column. Let\'s see: the context column in the current EDA is analyzed for unique counts. But the actual data structure for context: is it alphanumeric codes? Let\'s check the type. Wait, the previous EDA showed that in train, context has 106 unique values. So the context codes are like \'H04\', \'H01\', etc. So the context is a string of letters and numbers, like CPC codes.\n\nSo the next step could be to check the actual content of the context column. For example, run a query to see the first few entries of context to check what they look like. But maybe the user has already considered that, but to confirm, let\'s check. But maybe the next question could be: what are the first 5 entries of context in train.csv. But let\'s see if the current information is sufficient.\n\nMore importantly, about the anchor and target: word counts are short. For example, anchor maximum 5 words, target up to 15. So most phrases are very short. So the input to model is short text + context. But the current context is a code, not the description. So perhaps we need to get the CPC title description to include as part of the input. For example, the context code \'A61\' might have a description like \'Surgery; Medical or dental devices\'. Including that description would be helpful for the model to understand the context better.\n\nSo for the model to understand that \'A61\' means \'Surgery\', etc., maybe we need to append that description to the context. So first, need to check if the context codes can be mapped to descriptions. If yes, then merge with CPC titles data. So maybe a question to ask_eda: "What are examples of context codes and their corresponding descriptions from an external CPC definitions file?" But since the tool can\'t access external data, perhaps we need to do this in reality, but for EDA purposes, the current context codes are just codes. So the next step is to confirm that external CPC code descriptions are needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the data description it\'s mentioned that there\'s a CPC titles CSV or something. Let\'s check the data description again: \'Files: train.csv, test.csv, sample_submission.csv\'. So no CPC titles file. So the developer has to get the CPC titles from somewhere else. For example, from USPTO\'s website or another resource, maybe the policies mention that. So the developer needs to download that external data. For example, "CPC version 2021.05" is available at the CPC archive website. So the team needs to download that and process it.\n\nBut for the purpose of EDA, we can\'t check that yet. But we can hypothesize that context codes need to be expanded into textual descriptions.\n\nAlso, looking at the scores: 0.0, 0.25, etc. The evaluation is Pearson correlation. So we don\'t need to transform the scores, as we\'re predicting continuous scores. However, the target scores are discrete (in 0.25 increments), so perhaps some post-processing to map to those discrete values would help. But maybe the model can learn that. Also, since there\'s a small number of 1.0 scores, we might want to stratify by score bins during cross-validation to ensure that all score levels are represented.\n\nNow, checking for leakage: could the anchor and target have overlapping information? Like, if the anchor contains the target, or vice versa. For example, if anchor is \'voltage\' and target is \'voltage\', would that always be score 1.0? But not necessarily; maybe context matters. But if the target appears in the anchor as a substring, that\'s a strong signal. So perhaps we should check if anchor and target have exact matches. Let\'s see.\n\nBut the current EDA hasn\'t checked for exact matches. So next step: check for exact matches between anchor and target. How many pairs have anchor == target? And what are their scores?\n\nSimilarly, check for substring overlaps, or other similarities. This could be a leakage if the model uses the exact match as a trivial feature. So if the dataset is constructed such that the same anchor and target are always paired, but in test data, maybe same anchor and target exist, but also varying.\n\nWait, but in the competition, the pairs are made such that anchor and target may or may not be same. Let\'s check how many pairs have anchor == target.\n\nPossible next ask_eda question: "What is the count of rows where anchor == target in train.csv, and what are the corresponding score distributions for those rows?"\n\nAnother check: what\'s the correlation between anchor and target\'s word count? Probably not, but maybe not important.\n\nAlso, check if context is the same across different pairs. But we already checked context frequencies.\n\nAnother thing: the input is anchor, target, context. But context is a code. So when building the model, the context code may need to be expanded to its textual description. So perhaps we need to check if the context codes can be looked up and extended.\n\nBut in the absence of external data, possible next step is to note that context codes need to be mapped to descriptions. However, for now, perhaps the only idea is that context is a code, but for the model to understand better, we need to include the CPC title.\n\nBut maybe in the training data, there\'s a CPC titles mapping. But since it\'s not in train.csv, the developer must process it. So the EDA currently doesn\'t have that in the dataset, so the developer has to handle that.\n\nNow, the question for the developer\'s plan:\n\n1. Need to handle CPC code descriptions. So we should include merging the CPC descriptions from external data.\n\n2. Score distribution is imbalanced, especially 1.0 scores. So need to check if cross-validation should stratify by score bin to ensure all classes are represented.\n\n3. Check for exact matches between anchor and target. Like anchor == target. How many such cases, and their scores. For example, if 1.0 scores often have anchor == target, that\'s a clue that exact matches have high scores. But that\'s easy to check.\n\nLet me see: what\'s the count of anchor == target. Let\'s ask.\n\nNext question: "What is the count of rows in train.csv where anchor is exactly equal to target, and how are their scores distributed?"\n', 'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0}]}, {'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_40d9fe290009467691160af1', 'content': 'There are 255 rows in train.csv where anchor is exactly equal to target.\n\nScore distribution for exact matches:\nScore 1.0: 255 rows\n'}]
