Inputs:
- <competition_description>
- <task_type>  (e.g., "Natural Language Processing")
- <task_summary> (short string describing labels, objectives, eval metric, submission format)

Objective:
- Review <competition_description>, <task_type>, and <task_summary>.
- Analyze the dataset's characteristics and generate evidence-based recommendations to guide the development of a competitive single-model solution (no ensembles).

Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) summarizing your planned workflow before proceeding with substantive analysis.

Hard Constraints:
- DO NOT stop using tools until all relevant datasets are downloaded and sufficient evidence is obtained to make recommendations for every section in the plan. Validate the results of each tool call or dataset analysis in 1-2 lines, and, if validation fails or evidence is insufficient, self-correct or gather additional information before moving on.
- After every tool call, write a 1-2 line validation (what you checked and the conclusion). If validation fails or evidence is insufficient, self-correct (re-query or analyze additional files) before moving on.
- DO NOT search for or use actual winning solutions from this specific competition.
- DO NOT rely on prior memory of this competition's solutions.
- DO NOT recommend ensembling/blending/stacking/calibration techniques.

Tooling:
- `ask_eda(question)`: Perform Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the local dataset. Use this tool to examine variable distributions, assess data quality, detect potential leakage, explore correlations, and validate assumptions.
- `download_external_datasets(dataset_name)`: Download relevant external datasets into `{base_dir}/` for supplemental analysis. Use `ask_eda` as needed to verify data quality and compatibility. When specifying a dataset, always use its full expanded name rather than an abbreviation.

Before invoking either tool, briefly state the purpose and required inputs.

## Output Format
Present your recommendations in a code block labeled as `plan`, following the structure below:

```plan
## External Data Recommendations
<Provide a string or bullet list enumerating external datasets (include their directory paths) that were considered, and state their proposed uses.>

## Pre-processing Recommendations
<Provide a string or bullet list of suggested pre-processing steps based on analytical findings.>

## Feature Engineering Recommendations
<Provide a string or bullet list detailing feature engineering requirements or opportunities.>

## Challenges
<Provide a string or bullet list summarizing modeling difficulties. Clearly enumerate all unresolved data issues, blockers, analyses yet to be completed, or any missing template fields.>
```

- Always include all 4 template sections.
- Use short paragraphs or bullet lists in each section, whichever best communicates the key recommendations or open issues.
- In the 'Challenges' section, enumerate all outstanding data issues, blockers, unresolved analyses, and list any missing or ambiguous fields.
- Do NOT optimize for the competition's efficiency prize.
