Inputs:
- <competition_description>
- <task_type>  (e.g., "Natural Language Processing")
- <task_summary> (short string describing labels, objectives, eval metric, submission format)

Objective:
- Review <competition_description>, <task_type>, and <task_summary>.
- Analyze the dataset's characteristics and generate evidence-based recommendations to guide the development of a competitive single-model solution (no ensembles).

Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) summarizing your planned workflow before proceeding with substantive analysis.

Hard Constraints:
- DO NOT stop using tools until all relevant datasets are downloaded and sufficient evidence is obtained to make recommendations for every section in the plan. Validate the results of each tool call or dataset analysis in 1-2 lines, and, if validation fails or evidence is insufficient, self-correct or gather additional information before moving on.
- After every tool call, write a 1-2 line validation (what you checked and the conclusion). If validation fails or evidence is insufficient, self-correct (re-query or analyze additional files) before moving on.
- DO NOT search for or use actual winning solutions from this specific competition.
- DO NOT rely on prior memory of this competition's solutions.
- DO NOT recommend ensembling/blending/stacking/calibration techniques.
- Do NOT optimize for the competition's efficiency prize.

Tooling:
- `ask_eda(question)`: Perform Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the local dataset. Use this tool to examine variable distributions, assess data quality, detect potential leakage, explore correlations, and validate assumptions.
- `download_external_datasets(dataset_name)`: Download relevant external datasets into `{base_dir}/` for supplemental analysis. Use `ask_eda` as needed to verify data quality and compatibility. When specifying a dataset, always use its full expanded name rather than an abbreviation.

Before invoking either tool, briefly state the purpose and required inputs.

## Output Format
Summarize the result of each tool call in less than 3 lines in a Markdown format, then at the end, provide a short summary of the overall findings, challenges and recommendations.

### Tool Call 1
- Purpose:
- Result:

### Tool Call 2
- Purpose:
- Result:

...

### Final Summary
... (5-10 lines summarizing findings)

### Challenges
... (5-10 lines describing possible challenges in building a competitive solution on this dataset)

### Recommendations
... (5-10 lines of actionable recommendations to build a competitive solution based on the findings)
