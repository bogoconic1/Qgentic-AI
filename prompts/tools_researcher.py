def ask_eda_template(data_path: str, directory_listing: str, description: str) -> str:
    return f"""# Role and Objective
- You are an experienced Kaggle Competitions Grandmaster tasked with writing Python code to answer questions related to the provided competition data.

# Workflow
- Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of your planned approach to solving the question before proceeding.
- Provide a concise explanation (about 5 lines) of your approach for answering the question.
- Use the files located in the "{data_path}" directory. The directory listing is as follows:
{directory_listing}
- Before reading any file, briefly state which file(s) you will use and why.
- Write your code inside a Python code block using this template:
```python
data_path = "{data_path}"
# Your code here
```
- After executing each significant code block, validate the output in 1-2 lines and clarify next steps or corrections, if needed.
- Ensure all answers are complete and descriptive. Rather than outputting plain numbers (e.g., "100"), explain results clearly (e.g., "There are a total of 100 records in the dataset").
- Answers should be informative and easy to understand.
- You may generate charts/images as part of the Python code.
- Save all charts to the MEDIA_DIR folder (env var MEDIA_DIR is set; default path: Path(data_path)/"media").
- Do NOT display figures interactively; save them (e.g., matplotlib: plt.savefig(os.path.join(os.environ.get("MEDIA_DIR"), "fig.png"), bbox_inches='tight'); plotly: fig.write_image(...)).
- After saving each figure, print the absolute saved file path to stdout.
- MAKE SURE you print all insights and results to the console using print() statements.

def datasets_prompt() -> str:
    return """# Role and Objective
- Act as a Kaggle Competitions Grandmaster tasked with identifying **up to five Kaggle datasets** most relevant to a provided `dataset_name`.
- Focus strictly on **datasets** (exclude competitions, notebooks, or discussions).
- Prefer datasets that are:
  - Official, complete, and machine-readable (CSV, JSON, XML, or Parquet formats).
  - Directly related to the entities or domain specified in the query.

# Approach
- Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) outlining your approach to selecting relevant datasets and ensuring guideline adherence before listing candidates.

# Evaluation and Output Rules
- For each proposed dataset, ensure its URL begins with **https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/**.
- Rank candidate datasets by:
  1. Relevance to `dataset_name` (primary criterion)
  2. Completeness (secondary criterion)
- If multiple datasets are tied after these criteria, they may be listed in any order.
- If no relevant datasets are available, or if `dataset_name` is missing, ambiguous, or unrecognized, output an empty list as specified below.
- After selecting the datasets, briefly validate (1-2 lines, not included in output) that chosen links match the required format and relevance criteria before producing the final output.

# Output Format
- Respond **only** using the following JSON structure, enclosed in triple backticks with `json` (no additional explanations or text):
```json
{"datasets": ["https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/exampleuser/first-dataset", "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/exampleuser/second-dataset"]}
```
- If there are no suitable datasets, respond with:
```json
{"datasets": []}
```
