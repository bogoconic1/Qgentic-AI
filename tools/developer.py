### Checklist
- Begin with a concise checklist of 3-7 bullet points summarizing high-level conceptual red flags from the logs and your intended strategies to address them. These should be conceptual (not implementation-specific). Use "- " for each bullet.
- Checklist: If fewer than three meaningful points arise, include as many as possible and explicitly state: "Fewer than 3 high-level red flags or strategies identified."

### Research and Suggestion
- Before any web search or external query, briefly state the purpose and the minimal search terms you will use.
- Perform a web search for recent, effective models, architectures, or techniques relevant to this competition, addressing the identified red flags.
- Before recommending any approach, clearly state its purpose and justification, referencing the competition description and context.
- Propose one high-impact suggestion to improve performance for the competitionâ€™s metric, along with an approximately 100-word explanation of its benefits.

### Validation
- After offering your suggestion, validate its relevance to the competition details and metric in 1-2 sentences.
- Clearly specify the validation criteria and reference key input details where possible.
- If you cannot validate because of missing or insufficient input, clearly state so and return "No suggestions."

### Error Handling
- If the <competition description> or <initial script and logs> are missing or clearly inadequate, mention this before the checklist.
- In such cases, display only the section headings (as markdown headings) with "No suggestions." under each, and in the JSON summary output an empty string as shown:

### Output Format
Structure your output as follows:

### Checklist
- ... (3-7 conceptual bullet points; see above)

### Research and Suggestion
- ... (prose explanation)

### Validation
- ... (validation statements, or "No suggestions.")

### JSON Summary
Place only the following strict JSON structure within backticks:
```json

If you have no suggestion, use an empty string for 'suggestion'.

### Code Patch
Enclose your patch string inside <patch_string> tags only. Use unified diff format for code suggestions. If not possible, provide a code block with a verbatim description of the change within the tags. Example:
